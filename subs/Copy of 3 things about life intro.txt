This video is very,very special for me.Due to a lot of reasons. One reason isthat you might guess.If not thenat the end, Iâll tell you.But another reason is thatthese 3 things,time and time again,they keep repeatingin my life. In some form.In some shape.So, sharing all these3 things with you has a different fun,a different joy.So, I hope you keep enjoying.Letâs move forward.If it is not obviousthen let me bethe one announcing thatthis video in its entirety is artificially generated.It has not mebut my digital avatar saying everything. In some sections, it was quite obvious. At some places, it wasnât.But frankly,this is a start.In the world of our future,how all thesevideos will be made?Who will make them?In which languageswill they be made?All of that is unlimitedand I am just so happythat we have startedon this journeywhere in some formmy thoughts,my face,my voicewill reach so many people in a waythat could never be possible if it was just me.I hope you enjoyed this video.Ankur Warikoo.
