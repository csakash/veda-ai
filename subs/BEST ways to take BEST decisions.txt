Razor is a word in the English language.Not this one, another razor.Basically a mental model,a way for you to take decisionsas it is often found in life,the world, and situations.In this video,I will share with you such Razorsthrough which you will be able to takethe right decisions in life.Number 1:The Feynman Razor.Richard Feynman was a famous physicist,and his best quality was thathe used to explain very complex thingsin a simple way.So Feynman razor says that wheneveryou are talking to someone,and they use jargon, very big words,very complex things,it means that they don't reallyunderstand it properly,they don't understand it easily,they don't understand itfrom the first principle.If a person can explainto a 5-year-old childwhat they actually want to explain,that is the only way thatyou know that you have clarity,that is it only way thatyou know that you have truly understoodthe right thing.Number 2:The Luck Razor.If ever you have two choices in life,then take that choice through whichyour luck can be bigger,or a lucky event can change your life.Here is an example.You have two choices to spend time,either watch Reels on Instagramor watch Shorts on YouTube,keep scrolling,or devote that 1 hour to an online course.Out of these two things which hasthe maximum possibility to changeyour life through luck?The online course.Because in that, you will learnsomething new,maybe you will be able to applythat new thing in your jobor in a new project or in an interview,through which your life can change.It is also possible that you learnsomething new through Instagram Reelsor YouTube Shorts,but that has to be betterthan the other option.So whichever thing has more possibilityof luck and can change your life,take that decision.The Luck Razor.Number 3:The Arena Razor.If you have to take two decisions in life.One where you can be on the sideand do something,and second where you have to actuallyget into the arena and work,then pick the one that gets youinto the arena,because it's very easy to siton the side and do commentary.'Oh, Virat! This ball was worth a 6,my friend, what's going on, man?!'This is very easy.But to become Virat in that momentis very very difficult.So anything that gets you to playon the ground,anything that gets you in the middleof all the action,you will learn more from that,you might make more mistakesbut that will also add to your learningas against sitting on the side.Number 4:The Optimistic Razor.If you have to be friends with two peoplein the world,one is a pessimistand another is an optimist,then always choose the optimist,because optimists always look fora solution to every problem,but a pessimist always findsa problem in every solution.Number 5:The New Project Razor.If you get any new project,and until in your heartyou don't get a feeling for that project,'Hell yes! I want to do this project.'Don't do it!If you have a choice,then that choice should only be exercisedwhen you are so excited to do that projectthat you are enthusiastic,you feel eager to do it,and that is when you know thatthis project is for you.Number 6:The Uphill Decision Razor.If you have to take two decisions in life,then take the decision which actuallywill be difficult in the short term,because often the decisionswhich are difficult in the short term,or the path which is difficultin the short term,create long-term success.As they say, short-term pain is equalto long-term gain.That decision that is comfortablefor you in the short term,the decision which is easy for youin the short term,the decision which is beneficialfor you in the short term,will most likely be wrong for youin the future.Next:The Invested vs. Spent Razor.If you have to use your time in life,then you can either invest it or spend it.How to invest time?By doing new courses,by talking to good people,by reading books,by writing something,or by thinking of something.How to invest time?By reading good books,by watching good content,by writing, by talking to people,by learning something new,by exercising, by meditating,or by sleeping well.How to spend time?By scrolling,by constantly talking to friends,by binge-watching randomly,by eating randomly,by constantly sleeping.The decision to invest your timeis the true decision.Next:The Rooms Razor.If you get an opportunity to enter a room,then enter the roomwhere you are the dumbest.Because then you will get tolearn the most.That room would be the scariest as wellbecause when you will enter,you will be the dumbest,but that difficult roomis going to shape you up.You will learn so muchfrom their conversation,their feedback, and their experiences,that even though you may bethe dumbest person,the most inexperienced person,you will still be the onewho gains the most from that room.Next is my favorite:The Occam's (or Ockham's) Razor.Occam's Razor says that to explainany situation,usually, the most obvious explanationis right.We try to complicate a lot of things.We think,Oh, what would they have thought?Why did they speak like this?Why did they do this?And then we don't know in which world,in which parallel universe we go,but usually the simplest explanationis the right explanation.Here's an example.Your boss scolds you in the office,and you're like,They won't like my work,they don't like me,they are going to fire me,they want me to resign myself,they are going to promote someone else.You go intoa completely different direction,maybe the simplest explanation for thatis that he is having a bad day.It is nothing to do with you.He would have treated anyone elseinstead of you the same way.It is just his day or her dayat that point in time,and that is Occam's Razor.The simplest explanationto explain anything,more often than notis the right explanation.Next:The Lion Razor.It is my favorite.We think we only have to hustle in life.Just keep hustling!Keep working at night, during the day,just keep working, keep hustling!A lion works in a very different manner,after all, it's the king of the jungle.And the way that they do that isrest and attack, rest and hunt,rest and eat,and that is how they rule the jungle.They don't keep hunting all day.They hunt just once,but to prepare for that hunt,they rest for hours and days,and that is how you also look at life.If you have two decisions,one where you just have to hustle,and the other where you get time,time to prepare,time to recover,time to think,time to learn,and then you come in and do your best,that will be the right decision.The Lion Razor.The Smart Friends Razor.If your smartest friends are talkingabout something a lot,then pay attention to that thing,because they are smart.Because if each one of those peopleis independently gravitatingtowards that thing,then there is something in that,that you need to pay attention to.Very helpful Razor particularlyto predict what's going to happenin the future.Imagine, in 2012, 2013, 2014,the smartest people in the worldwere beginning to think and talkabout something called Bitcoin.It started much before 2012-13,but the smartest people weretalking about it at that time.The technology behind Bitcoin,the revolution that it might bring,the infrastructure needed to build that,how it is going to affect so many thingsfrom a decentralization perspective,and that is where the worldis beginning to move.It doesn't matterwhat the rate of Bitcoin is right now,it doesn't matterwhether it's a good investment or not,but crypto built on blockchain technologyis going to change the worldbecause the smartest peopleare working on it right now,and that's fascinating.The Young and the Old Test.It's a beautiful test.It says whenever you are in a dilemma,do a young and old test.Ask whether your 80-year-old avatarwill be happy with whatever decisionyou are taking,whatever situation you are in,and whether your 8-year-old avatarwill be happy with it or not.You have to please these 2 people,your 10-year-old selfand your 80-year-old self.Your 10-year-old selfwill be inspired by you,maybe motivated by you,and maybe they would want to be that.Your 80-year-old self will probablybe happy to see you,maybe they will feel thatthere is no regret in life,life was very good,and these two individualsthen make up for good decisions in life.If you are not happy with your job,if you are not happy with your college,and then you will go back and say,If I keep doing this,despite the fact that I am not happy,despite the fact that I am not good at it,how will my 80-year-old self see it?And it's quite likely that,that 80-year-old self will say,you are making a mistake,that it is not for you,that you have to reconsider,that you have to reimagine,that you have to reorganize yourselfto do that.Your 10-year-old self will say,I don't want to be in that positionwhen I grow up.I will have to get out of this situation.And then it'll be instantly obvious to youthat if the 10-year-old selfand the 80-year-old selfare not happy with it,then why are you?You are not stuck!The Braggers Razor.It's quite interesting,especially for Delhi.If anybody tries to show thatthey have a lot of money,then they are insecure,because people who really have money,people who really have an understandingof who they are,never feel the need to show offthat money, to drop that namewhich will increase their status,which will increase their respect,so that the society will see themfrom a different perspective.The Braggers test is a brilliant testthrough which you instantly get to knowwho the real wealthy person is.The Reading Razor.This is a brilliant one to decidewhat to read.And the principle of my life is to readwhat I enjoy.That's it!Don't read what people ask you to read.Often people ask me which book to read.And I say read any book you like.You can read Chacha Chaudhary, Pinky,Billu, Asterisk, Tintin, any comic book,any fiction, non-fiction,whatever you want, it doesn't matter.I can say what I am saying.It is not necessary to readPsychology of Money,Atomic Habits, or Do Epic Shit,read whatever you want,because you have to builda habit of reading,and that is why The Reading Razoris such a great thing.Read whatever grabs your attention,but it needs to be a book,because when you do this on the internet,then you get distracted.A book holds your attention,if it holds your attention,and then you don't get distracted,the book becomes your whole world.And finally, I think perhapsthe most important Razor of all.The Stress Result Razor.Everybody has stress in their life.But the question is,what is the stress all about?What is the reward of that stress?We take a lot of stresswhich has no upside.We're just scared, we're just nervous,we're just working,we're just trying to avoid our failure,and that's why we're stressed.And we are stressed becausewe are doing something in lifethat we don't even want to do,but are forced to do,and that stress is never good.But there will be some stressthat you must take,because you know with that stressyou will be able to go so high,your upside will be so good,your reward will be so good,and that stress is worth it.So don't shy away from stress in life,but take the right kind of stress,the stress that comes with a reward.I hope that all these razors,all these mechanisms,and all these mental modelswill be useful to you in taking decisions.I hope you create your own razor,your own way of living life,and your own decision model.If you have one,then please share itin the comment section.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
