Dear Ankur,I recently got a job,it's been 3 months,but it's scary to think thatprobably recession is coming,and I go to office every daywith the fear that todayI will be laid off.I don't know how to deal with thatbecause I am scared of losing my job.A lot of financial responsibilitiesdepend on my job,and I don't know what can help me.Can you help me?This is a very live email.This could be an email thatyou haven't sent to anybody,but you have this email in mindabout your life.And in this video,I want to share some tips and trickswith you which can get you your dream jobin recession.A perspective through whichyou can convince your mindsetthat even during the hardest times,you have a chance to win.Number 1:Focus on your skills and abilities.When you start working,you must realize thatyou were selected by someone,you are not a random person,you were filtered from a lot of peopleand then got selected.And that means somebody valued youfor your skill or your ability.You may not have that skill right now,you may have to groom that skill,but somebody bet on you and said,this person can be good at this skill,and that should be your focus.You may have to remind yourselfthat for the skill,whether it's digital marketing,coding, sales, marketing,or whatever the case may be,I was hired for this skilland this is the skill thatcan hopefully get me my next job as well,or get me my growth in this job itself.So you will always have to bringback your focus to that skill.Number 2:But along with that skill,you have to build a network as well.Network within the companyand network outside of the company.First, let's talk aboutnetwork within the company.For that, connect with people.Connect with people who are outsideof your department, get to know them.When you build a camaraderie,a relationship,then things become much easier for you.Your work becomes easy,people have a level ofemotional connection for you,and it becomes harder for themto see you outside of that,and that helps.You also have to build your networkoutside of the company,because that will create opportunitiesfor you.Connect with peopleon LinkedIn and Twitter.These two platforms are very criticalfor professional growthin today's day and age.So you have to ensure thatyou connect with strangers,potential hires, managers in a waythat helps you build yournext set of opportunitiesif God forbid,something happens to your current job.Number 3:If you are laid off,then you have to stay persistent.It would be a difficult time.It is very easy to create a video,but it is extremely difficultto understand what you are going through.I don't know!Nobody knows!Only you know!But one thing will always help you,persistence.Every day after you wake up,do the smallest of thingsthat will take you toward your new job.Even the smallest of things!Not the big things!It's not like since you haveto get a new jobso you have to just focus on that,or you just have to focuson building a network,do the smallest thing possible.For example,if you want to create a network,then the smallest thing possiblewill be to look for a personon LinkedIn with whom you wantto connect today,and you will just send them a cold email.That's it!That's all that you have to do!Or if you want to focus on your resume,then the smallest thing you can do isto go back to that resumeand make one small change to it.Something that gets you out of thatmindset that things are not working,because whenever things become stagnant,then a small step can move you awayfrom that stagnancy,and take you on a growth path.Number 4:Be open to different industriesor different companies,maybe even different functions.Just remember that whenevera recession comes,then all the industries are nothit equally.For example, when a recession came in 2020because of Covid,a lot of industries were badly hitlike hospitality, tourism of course,and transportation,but there were some industriesthat actually benefited.Education benefited a lot,energy benefited a lot,and healthcare pharma benefited a lot.So if you ask yourself with an open mind,my skills,which was the first point,where can they be transferred?The industry in which they can still bereplicated and appreciated,then you can be flexiblewith that industry,with that brand, even with that geography,and then your recession periodwould not be as painfulas for other people.Number 5: Keep learning.Always keep learning!In fact, not just for recession,this is for the whole life.If you have the ability to becomea student whenever need be,that is the best mindset for your life.You can take online courses,register on platforms,take offline classes if you want,join online communitieswhere you can learn something newfrom people that you are interacting with,anything and everythingto make it possible for youthat you always learn something new,or you keep refining the skillor capability that you haveand gather a deeper experience.Number 6:Be unique in your job search.Ask yourself,which is the method that everybodyis adopting because you have to dosomething different from that.For example, if you are an animatorthen one option is,you keep sending applications,this is my work in animation,this is my experience in animation,this and that,but there is another way,and that way is somethingthat happened recently.To apply to Cred, one animatoranimated the logo of Credand posted it on LinkedIn.And how cool is that?!Because now suddenly,you are standing apart.You are creating an identity of your ownby breaking away from the herd.And this is not something that onlyone person can do,everybody can do it.Every single day,I get so many cold emails,but some of them are very unique.The other day itself, I got an emailfrom a graphic designer, and they said,I am a graphic designer,I want to work with Waricrew,and this is my resume.And I replied to that personthat this is such a wasted opportunity.You are a graphic designer.You didn't share yourgraphic design art with me,and you shared your resume with mewhich is the poorest representationof a graphic designer's work,and you didn't even go one step beyondand say that,let me design the thumbnail for you,or a redesign of the quote posterthat I posted on Instagram.Something that tells me thatyou are truly a good graphic designer.Why would you not put that effort in?You can uniquely position yourselfby doing all these things.So, please be unique in your job search.Number 7:Be prepared for interviews.Interview, especially during a recession,can happen at any point in time.In fact, it seems thata lot of conversationsare just conversations,but they are an interview in disguise.So you always have to be on top.What are the questions on whichI hesitate?What are the questions thatI am always asked?And I need to be on top of that game.What are the questionswhich embarrass me a lotbut I have to give an answer?For example, if you are laid off,people will ask you,why were you laid off?And you need to tell them the truth.It was not your fault.It is an economic condition of the companybecause of which you got this result,but that doesn't mean that you arewrong in what you have done.But if in your mind you will feel thatno, I was wrong,and because of this, I got laid off,then that will automatically come outin an interview.So number 7,always be ready for an interview.Number 8:Consider going freelance.There are numerous freelancingopportunities in the world,and freelancers are actually killing it,especially if you are in your 20s,and you don't have a lot offinancial responsibilities,maybe you are only responsiblefor yourself or your immediate family,then freelancing could be a great option.The income is slightly unpredictableof course,but with some struggle and hard work,and building on your experience,you can make that unpredictable incomea lot more predictable.Upwork, Fiverr, and freelancer.comhave a lot of opportunitiesin every possible streamthat you represent.And till you are looking for a jobor maybe even beyond,you can play the role of a freelancer.Number 9:Be realistic with yoursalary expectations.In a recession,the economy is the biggest impact.Economic impact means,the salary you use to get earlier,you may not get that much.Because every company, every industry,realigns its salary figures.And that means thatwhen they hire new people,then they are usually ata lower salary thanwhat it used to be in the past.So be ready for that.Optimize for having a job,optimize for having financial stability,optimize for your growthand your learning,because when this period will end,when the recession period ends,you will again be backon the lines of growth,but for now,don't disregard the importanceof financial stability.And based on all these, a bonus tip.Please eat healthy, stay healthy,and follow positive content.There is a lot of content,especially at this point in time,which is very negative.You will read about layoffs all over,you will read about peopleand their miserable stories.Somewhere someone did not getthe expenses of their hospitalization,someone missed their insurance,someone was pregnant and they were fired,or someone had childrenand could not pay their school fees.There are immense stories,and all of them are real, ok?So I am not saying that they are not realand that's why you should disregard them,but if they do not supportyour mental well-being,then you are not going to help yourselfby consuming this news.Please follow positive content.Be healthy, go for walks, do exercise,keep yourself physically fit,and please eat healthy.It is not that I am looking fora job right nowor there is not much work in the job,so because of that,you will eat anything.You have to stay positive becauseas long as you have this positive mind,you will be able to navigate through thiswith the best results.But the day and the time,this mind missed them,then that's it.It's game over!All my tips are frankly useless,because until you don't convincethis part of your bodythat you will be able to get through it,till then everything will seem blissful,but it will not create any impact.I hope that 2023 is a good yearfor you professionally.I hope that all these thingsthat I've told you, you don't need them,but still keep these things in mindand be always ready,because irrespective of what is happening,whether recession or not,whether lay off or not,you always need to be a student,and that's the promise we makeas a group, as a community.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
