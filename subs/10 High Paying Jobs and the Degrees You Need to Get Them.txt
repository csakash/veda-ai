Number 1: Years of experience.There is a very strongcorrelation betweenyears of experienceand the salary thatyou are getting.The more experience you have,usually the moresalary you will have,and it will grow inthat particular order.Number 2: Location.The location where you workmakes a huge differenceon what your salaryultimately will be. There is a cost-of-living factorembedded into the profile itself. For example, the average salary in Gurgaon is 22% more than thenational average.In Delhi, it is 15%.In Chennai, it is 9%.In Mumbai, it is 6%. In Pune, it is 1% less from the national average.So, there is a certaincost of living that is built into your salary based on your location.Number 3: Your educationalqualifications and the college you went to.There is a strong correlation between your bachelorâs degree,or your masterâs degree,or a professionaldegree after that,and that determines your salary.The institute you went to,the difficulty or selectivity ofadmission process of the nstitute, it also determines whetheryour salary is high or not.For example, if you are from an IIT,or if you are from a WarikooInstitute of Technology,then naturally,for the same degreeand for the sameeducational qualifications,an IITian would earn more salarybecause they went to a harder college to get into.So, the selection was difficult,and that meansthey have something which very few people have.So, these were the top 10paying jobs in the countryaccording to a report, and more importantly, the 3 biggest determinantswhich determine your salary.Years of experience,your educational qualification,and your location.If you want a better salary, then focus on these 3 thingsirrespective of the job orthe industry you are in,and you'll certainlysee results.
