It's about seventh grade,I used to study in a boys schooland I rememberthere used to have poemor singing competition,so don't know why, my teacherput my name in that,brother you have to go.And I had stage fright,used to be really scared.So, I still remember,before going on stage,I was scared to death,hands were shaking,was sweating, heart was pounding,legs were shaking.And I just wanted that moment,that time to end quickly.I went on stagedidn't know what was to be saidwith folded hands. Just spoke.Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.Got over.And silence.Not a single person,applause was a distant dream,wasn't even booing,wasn't even screaming.Were just staring at me.Everybody was looking at methat what just happened?But it didn't really matter to me.I was just relievedthat this time is over.I got off the stageWent back and sat with my friend.And my friend said at that time,Ankur, what just happened?And I was like what happened?And he was Like, you went on stage,you started talkingyour mouth was movingyour lips were moving,But not a single wordcame out of your mouth.For 2 minutes,I gave that speech in my mind.Not even a word had come out of my mouth.This was my first experienceof public speaking.And that day I decidedThat I will never go back on stage.And it so happened,that in the 11th class,a farewell has to be given,to the ones in 12th,as they are passing out,so its function,which used to be a very big functionin our school,its function had two main charactersand one of themfell ill at the last minute.So, again my class teacher saidthat Ankur will go and replace him.And I don't knowthis time she said it in a waythat it inspired confidence.I wanted to go,not for myself but for her.Because at one point,I wanted to go not for myselfbut for her.Because at one levelI didnât want to disappoint her.And I am so glad that I went,because this time I had fun.Yes, I was still scared, trembling.The heartbeat was fast,but a different Ankur was born.That was me at the age of 16.And in my 20sa skill that I played out very well,learned, after stumbling a lotkept getting good at it,that is public speaking.So, if you see a form of mine todayin which you think,that he is such a great communicator,he speaks so easily,he speaks this, he speaks that,I wasnât born with all these skills,I was just as scared as you.In a way, I was convincedthat I would never be able to becomea confident speaker on stage.But the only thing that I didwas, in my 20s,didnât lose any opportunityto speak on stage,to speak in front of people,and that was one of the skillsthat I invested in my 20s.Number two.We never grew up with money.My parentsare from a very simple background.Papa all his lifewas in a sales and marketing job,used to keep touring.Going to Bihar, going to Kashmir,going to UP, used to sell medicines.Mother was a teacher in a primary school.Never had that much money.At some point or the other,some or the other debt was often running.And when you grow up without money,you start to hate money.It seems to youthat money is the root of all trouble.Problems in our lifeare because of money.Happiness isnât there because of moneyand the day money comes in,that day everything will be right.But I also knowthat when you grow up without money,So, one of two things happens to you.Either you run after money all your life,or you live life in such a waythat you turn money into your slave.And I don't knowhow one gets to decide these two.But I am luckythat I grew up in the second category,where I used to hate moneybut to the extent,that I never wanted to be a slave of moneyI will not run after money,money will follow me.So, from a very young age,I started investing.I stumbled a lot in investment.Took too many dirty decisions.But even if itâs in your naturethat I will use the money, so thatwhatever little money I am earning,it starts working for meand I will not work for money,was something I learned in my 20s.And I have learned that by stumbling.Whatever I tell you aboutpersonal finance today,I don't tell because I am qualified,I am a CA,along with Rachanaji or with Akshator with Pranjal,even I am a very huge personality,who knows everything, no.It's not even a distant reality.I only teach you because,I have learned from my mistake.I am a newbie.Iâve made so many mistakesand because of this, through my mistakes,I am trying to teachyou money or personal finance.So, the second skillthat I learned in my 20swas the art of investing.To make money work for youas against working for money.Number three.Often people ask me,how do we deal with failure?Dealing with failure is very difficult,especially in our society.Every person in India is told,no matter what happens, shouldn't fail,don't return as a loser.And we begin to get scarred of failing.We feel that the day we are defeated,we will be defeatedbut will also defeat our parents,will defeat our brothers and sisters,will defeat the society,will defeat ourselves too.I failed a lot in my 20.After doing a PhD in my life.I wanted to go to the US.Sorry, wanted to go to US to do a PhD.Wanted to become a scientist.Wanted to join NASA.And I did all that.But leaving all that I came back to India.Because I was not getting happiness.I was good at that thingbut I was not happy doing that thingand when I came backthe whole world felt like I had lostEven I myself felt that I had lost.I prepared for IIT twice,it didn't happen in JEE both the times,applied to so many MBA schools.It didn't happen there either.Applied for so many consulting jobs,It didn't happen there.So much so thatI have created a failure resume of mine.If you go to Googleand search for Warikoo failure resume,you will justifiablyfind a list of my defeats,not just one, but many.That is something that I am happy about.In my 20s,I actually practiced failing.I failed so much,stumbled so many timesthat I learned how to overcome it.And when I am faced with this questionAnkur, how do I deal with failure?My response is,learn to lose.Lose as many times as you can.Every day do somethingthat you know you'll lose,but that won't result in somethingthat will rock your life.Ask for money from a stranger.Next time in the elevator,make eye contact with a strangerand say good morning, good afternoon,good evening, and hello.Feel scared, right?Feels like, they may consider you crazyas a creepy kind of a person.But these are the momentswhere you build your failure muscle.Failure is a muscle.Failure is an experience,the more you experience it,the better you will be able to handle itand deal with it.So, the third skill that I built in my 20swas how to failbecause of which I know how to win.Number four.My favorite Excel, Excel.I can't even tell youhow strange its story is.As I told,I am from a very simple family,so there was never a computer at home.There was a computer in the school,but what did we do with it?Three children sat at a computer.One is typing A,one is typing N,one is typing K.The one who used to be the leaderof that groupused to hit enter,then someone used to save.So, it was not like learning something.I didn't even have an idea about Excel.Then I went to the US at the age of 22.And for the first timeI got a computer of my own.As a PhD student every person there,student, gets a computer.And I also had to teach children,because my scholarship too came from that.And somebody introduced me to Excel.I still remember,he opened this sheet.I thought it was just some sheet.Looked like a chess board.Then there were multiple numbers in thatand to add those numbersequal to, sum, bracket,highlighted that,bracket close, enter.[fingers snap]and it was a sum.And I was like, this is a calculatorBut the calculator is on the computer.That was my first introduction to Excel.And I am mentioning Excel as a skill,because Excel is a tool,but Excel is also a view point.Excel is view pointthat is very important to me in my life,that I test everythingbefore emotions come in with dataI view everything through data or numbers.Whether it is to buy a houseor live on rent,buy a car or take it on rent,even to evaluate any decision,to pre-pay the loan or continue to pay,and invest the rest of the money,the lump-sum money that comes in,where to invest it.Every decision in my life,before emotion comes in,is taken with data.Feelings are definitely bound to comebut this skill of mineto think in numbers and to think in data,is something that has helped meso much in my life.And I am sure, will help you as well.Number five.And for this, I have to thank my mother.Whenever in my childhood,we, sorry, not I,used to go on vacations,railway station,used to go by train,so the most exciting wasbookstall at the railway station.And on the bookstallChacha Choudhary, Nagraj,Pinki, Billoo, Super Commando Dhruv.I don't knowif you have even heard their names,but these were like iconic comic booksthat used to come out in those times.And mom, we didn't have money,but always,never stopped me from buying books.That was a beautiful part about her,beyond so many other things.A â¹10-book was too expensive at that time.And it will also end in a few hours.But I used to value that so much,because I used to readthe same comic again and again.Used to read again and again.Whenever felt bored, I used to read.I knew which joke is about to comebut before reading the joke,I used to start laughing because I knewwhich joke is about to come.And by all this,got habituated to reading.I didn't grow up reading books,I grew up reading comic books,and while reading those comic books,I got into the habit of reading,that today without reading,the day just doesn't passAnd reading is just so beautiful.Because inside a bookone's whole life, his imagination,his experiences are contained.And for the cost of what?Less than a pizza?You can get to experiencesomebody's life, somebody's thought,somebody's entire body of work.It baffles me people don't read books.But thankfully I got into that habit.And I'm sure if you too in your 20sinculcate that habit,you will not regret itfor the rest of your life.Nothing is taught in collegeand I am sorry I am saying this.I am from Delhi University,from Hindu Collegeand all the teachers of Delhi Universityor ones who have already studied.Is it a teacher? Teacher, sorry.So, whoever is a studentof Delhi University,or has already studied,would know that nothing happensin Delhi University.So those 3 yearswhen I was in Hindu College,academically nothing happened.But it was very interestingwhat I learned as a result of it.Because the professorsmostly used to not comeEven if came, wouldn't teach willingly.Even if taught, don't know was taught.Were in a very boring way.So you had to take the ownershipof studying.Because I loved physics,I used to find my own waysto learn and understand the same thing.And that trained meon how to become a studentwithout the help of a teacher.What was the best thingI learned in college?How can you learn any new subject,a new course, without any direction,except for a text book?How can you become a student?And I'll tell you, that thisis the most important lesson in life,because we have to learn all our life,have to keep learningSo many things in life,are changing so fast,that you cannot keep going backto a school or a college,to learn something new.You have to learn by yourself.Will have to learn through courses,will have to learn online,will have to learn by reading,will have to learn by listening,will have to learn by watching,will have to learn by writing,but you have to learn.So, if you have masterhow to learn,Then that will set you up for life.And that's what I learned in my 20s.And then in doing PhDyou get further more training.So I am blessedthat I was a science student.Then also went out to do a PhD.Although did not finish,but that training set me up very well,that I knew how to learnsomething new and to figure it outthrough my own meritand dedication and discipline.A life lesson,life skill for life.When I went to US,suddenly I was surroundedby very smart people.From different countries,with different experiences,with different world views,different way of eating,different way of wearing,different way of speaking,and none of us were similar.In my entire department,I was the only Indian student.I still rememberthere were American students,there were Korean students,there were Chinese students,there were Italian students,there were German students.And when you're surroundedby such different people,who think so defiantly,have been raisedon really different beliefs,that two things can happen,either you'll further get drawninto your cocoonthat my country, my people, my Indiaor you will try to know all those people.And I am glad I chose the latter.Yes, I used to hang out morewith my Indian students,with my Indian friends.But I always used to askwhy is their perspectiveso different from mine?How do those Italians, those Americans,see such a simple thing so differently?And I ask this simple question,what is it that they know,that I don't?What do they know that I don't?What do they see, in what way do they see,in a way that I do not see it?And that just helped me a lot.Then when I went to ISB for my MBA,again I was surroundedby such smart peopleand I had no ideawho I am, what I am good at,what I am not good at.So I surrounded myselfwith very, very different people.And I learned a lot from all of them.So, if you spend time in your lifeonly with those who are like you,then you will not learn anything new.But if you also spend time with peoplewho way apart from you,are very different,you will actually learnsomething new about the world.And this is a skillthat will always help you in life.It 100% did for me.When I came back from US,after dropping out from my PhD,my main plan in life was ruined.I had no ideawhat to do in my life now?People were telling me one thing,that Ankur,if plan A didn't work, then plan B,plan B didn't work, then plan C,plan C didn't work, then plan D,but to win in life,friend you need a plan.Without a plan, you won't be able to win.But on what basis would I make a new plan.My best laid plan for lifewas destroyed in front of my eyes.So, I had no basis,foundation to come up with another plan.So, I asked my lifea very different question.Is it possibleto live life without goal,without target, without plan.And if yes, then how would that life be?And I figured the answer.And that's what I've been doingfor the rest of my life.For the last 17 years,there is no plan, no goal,no target in my life.The only thing in my life is habits.I don't build goals and targets,I build habits,because those habits have taken me furtherthan I could have ever planned for myself.Could never set a target.Wherever I am todayI couldn't have even imagined that.It is a far cry even to work towards itand the reason why I am hereis because my habits, my way of thinking,my way of working,my way of living my life is suchthat I pick up things as a challenge.That I don't run away from risk.That I figure outhow can I do this new thing,by managing my risk,where my upsideor my potential to win is very high.And if that happens then it works outand if it doesn't work out,I'm still back to where I am.Will not be lower than that,will be where I am.And that helps.This skill of building your life on habitsas against goals and targetshas helped me immensely.Try this and see.When I was preparing for IIT in my school,I felt like I was wasting a lot of time.But how will I know, I am wasting time,I feel, what happens just by feeling?So, then I did what every science studentis taught to do.That start measuring.If you feel it, then prove it,whether it is happening or not.I started recording every hour of my day,Every hour.What did I do in that hourand was it productivetowards my studies,towards my goal or not?I started this at the age of 13and kept doing it till the age of 26.For 13 yearsI recorded every hourof every day in my lifeUnfortunately, most of themwere eaten by termites,because I used to record on notebooks,then they were lying in a box,termites came and took away everything.The electronic form remains.For example, in ISB,I used to record my whole dayon an Excel sheet,the details of every hour.So if you ask mewhat were you doingon February 13th, 2005 at 5:40 pm?I actually know the answer.I will know the answer.But what did it do for me?I understood the relationshipwith my time.I came to understand,when my day is the most productive?Why does it become so?And how can I further it more?I understood,as soon as I see my day in front of me,before even living it,how is that day going to go.Because it's been a 13-year trainingof recording, measuring, and analyzing it.If you start this thing,your life will change,I guarantee you.And last,and for this, I have to say thanksagain to my parents.In India, when a child is trying to walk,and falls down while walking,and starts crying,the parents hug by the shoulder,or hold to their neck or chest--Hold to their neck--Hold to their chest.And then they start beating the ground.Because that's the only waythe baby will stop crying.Not true, but we think so.But if we tell the childthe pain you are feelingis because of someone else,and you will feel right by beating him,then maybe the child will stop crying.But with this approachwhat are we teaching the child?We are basically telling the childthat your suffering, your defeatis because of someone else.Your pain is due to someone else,and if that persongets the fruits of his sins,you will be happy by that.It basically tells usthat things happening in your livesis not your responsibility.I'm so glad that my parentsnever did that.My parents never beat the ground,nor did they ever tell mesomeone else's deed, has caused you pain.They always saidthat whatever you are feeling in life,you are doing it because you yourselfwill suffer the consequencesof your decisions.You are responsiblefor the consequences of your decision.It builds accountability.The best thing I learned in my 20sis that I am accountableand responsible for my life.What is happening to me in my lifeis my responsibilityand my own outcome.The result of my decisions.And that set me up for life.Because today I do not heckle anyone.I don't feel resentful towards anyone.I don't blame anyone.I don't complain.I just say that if somethingis not going right in my life,then I have to work harderand I have to change my perspective,that this that is happeningis trying to teach me something.And if I learn something,I'll become a better person from it.Will become a better person.And if I don't want to learn,then no matter how much I curse people,because of that, I won't be ableto become a better person.And that changed everything.It changed everything.These little lessons in life,which seem small at that time,but grow up to be huge in the future,are the ones that I am grateful for.And hope that even you in your 20s,can learn something from these lessons,can adopt these lessons in your life.Add you will think yourselfand nobody elsewhen you realize the benefit of them,when you grow old.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
