Check 1 2 okIn this video, we will get to knowhow to invest through smallcaseright from how do you startto making returns.Friends, I have often spokenabout smallcase, and in this video,I'm presenting to youa complete guide to smallcase investing.I have made many videoson smallcase but they are scattered,sometimes I've focused on one feature,sometimes on another,but after watching this video,you can get an end-to-endabsolute clarity on,what it is to invest in smallcase?In this video, we will discuss 5 things.First of all, what is smallcase investing?Secondly, why should smallcase investingbe considered, especiallywhen there are stocks,there are mutual funds?Number 3, how doessmallcase investing work?Number 4, what are the costsattached with smallcase investing?And number 5, what are the risksthat you will have to bear in mindif you consider smallcase investing?First of all, what is smallcase?As I have said, whenever you investin the stock market,there are typically three methods.One is trading.I don't focus a lot on itbecause I'm not an expert,I don't even trade personally,but trading is you bettingon short-term movements of a stock price.So, if the stock goes from â¹100 to â¹102,then you will bet on this movement of 2%,and you will buy and sell within a day.This is also FnOor Futures and Options trading,or derivatives trading,where you may not sell within a daybut may sell after some time,but you are actually bettingon the movement of the price of the stockin a short term period.The second and thirdare long-term investing bets.This is where I'm interested,because here you make a consistentamount of return over a reallylong period of time, so you can seethe impact of compoundingon your portfolio.As I said, there are 2 methods.One is that you buy stocks directly.The stocks which are really good,the company is good,the revenue is good,the profit is good,the market share is good,the industry is growing,governance or management team is good,all those things that you want.And then, of course, there are ratios,there's PE ratio,by how much is EPS increasing?What is the actual value?What is the debt-equity ratio?So on and so forth.But like I'm explaining this to you,this is not something thatyou and I are capable of,I'm assuming on your behalf,but at least, I'm not.I know a few stocks,I bet on them properly,but for me to identify,what would be multi-bagger?Multi-bagger are those stocksthat give a lot of returnsover a period of time,like 5-10 times the return.That becomes very hard becausethat requires expertise,it requires deep research,it requires you to godeep into the industry,into the market, into the company.I don't have the time and expertisefor all that.And that's why, the third optionis a portfolio of stocks.Here in a way, you are assigningsomeone for all the researchand expertise.Because what they are doing is,they are doing the researchon your behalf, and they are essentiallyhelping you buy intoa portfolio of stocks.When you buy a portfolio of stocksor a group of stocks,as against buying justone company's stocks,then you mitigate your risk as well.For example, you want to participatein the chemical industry,or pharma industry,or auto industry,now you don't the best companyin chemical, or pharma, or auto,but can know who are the top 10 playersbecause that's far easier.And if you were to buy the stocks oftop 10 auto companies, pharma companies,or any such industry,then you are going to get justas good returns, definitely notas good as the stock you buyif that stock works,but at the risk-adjusted level,you will get pretty good returns.Because God forbidif one company goes down,the other company will go up.If the revenue projections go wrongin the other company,the fourth company will cover it up,so those 10 companies will in some waygive you the needed return.Smallcase allows you to buya portfolio of stocksthat are based on ideas.And I will tell you what that means,but that is what is smallcase.It's a buying or an investing processwhere you buy into an idea,as against just one stock.Number 2, it sounds very similarto mutual funds, so why shouldI consider smallcase investing?There are 3 reasons for it.Number 1, as I said,you are investing in ideas.What does that mean?It means whenever you will lookat a portfolio of stocks thatare run by managers,then typically they are focusedon the return of the mutual fund.So one would be high growth,another would be medium growth,another would be small-cap,another would be large-cap,but you very rarely geta representation of ideas.I'll give you an example.For example, one idea is,the rural sector of India willexperience very good growthin the next 10-20 years.Their disposable income will increase,they will get a lot of facilities,tools and technologies,so while sitting at homethey will be able to experienceas much growth in their rural sectoras urban growth.Now, what if you want to bet on that?What if you want to bet on companiesthat are catering to the rural economyof this country?It's very difficult to do this throughany other portfolio of stocksbut on smallcase,you can actually do that.So when you look at somethinglike Rising Rural Demand,this is actually a portfolio of stocks,a small case that allows you to investin all the companies that are goingto benefit from the rising rural demand.So this smallcase has companiesthat either derive a significant amountof their revenue from rural India,or are striving to enhance their footholdacross rural markets to benefitfrom increasing rural demand.This is a very powerful idea.Based on this there is another one called,Great India Middle Class.India's middle classis constantly expanding,their disposable income is increasing.They are getting their housespainted more, they are eating out more,they are buying more cars,they are spending more on travel.So what are the companiesthat are benefiting from that,and can I invest in those companies?Because I know that the companieswhich bet on India's middle classin the next 10-20 yearsare likely to do well.What is a great way of doing that?Smallcase.So you look here, this smallcaseincludes companies that are expectedto benefit from the growthin the Indian middle class.House of Tata.You really love Tata Group,you really like all the companiesof Tata Group, whether it is Titan,or TCS or Elxsi,so what do you want to do isyou want to invest in these companies.So you want to invest in these companieswhich own Jaguar Land Rover,Tetley tea, blah, blah, blah.Now, what would be the stocks and weights?So that's number 1,which is investing in ideas.Number 2 is all the research isdone by experts, you are not doing it.You don't have to find outwhich stocks should you buy,which company's portfolio you should make,what should be its weightage,all of that is done by experts.They will not just tell youwhich stock to buy in what quantity, butthey will also tell you that every week,or every month, or every quarter,or every year, if there is any change,then how to execute that change.You just have to click onthe Smallcase app or the desktop versionand complete the process,I will show youhow the whole process is done,but it is as simple as that.And number 3, which is great,personally for me,you get 100% control and ownershipat all points in time,because smallcase is connectedthrough your Demat account,so wherever you open your Demat account,it could be Zerodha, it could be Upstox,it could be 5paisa,it could be Angel Broking,so wherever is your Demat account,you connect your smallcase to it,that is when you will be able tobuy and sell smallcases.So whenever you will buy something thenthose stocks will not be in smallcase,they will be in your Demat account.Whenever you sell something,you will not sell it through smallcase,it will be sold throughyour Demat account.So you at all points in timehave 100% ownership over your stocksthat you buy through smallcase.So how does smallcase work?It has 3 steps.Number 1, opening up a smallcase account.Number 2, buying your first smallcase.And then number 3,something called rebalancing which isa very important and necessary step.Let's go through all these 3 steps.Number 1, you will have to connect yourDemat account to your smallcase account.If you do not have a Demat account,then start with that first.So there is a link in the pinned commentand the description about how to opena Demat account in Zerodha.If you do that, then you can open upa Zerodha account.You can open any otherDemat account as well.So you will see on the screen,Zerodha, Alice Blue, 5paisa, Angel One,HDFC Securities,all of them are available,and you can always do that.If you do not have one,then you can open up an account online,all that privilege and control is yours.I have a personal account on Zerodha,so I will connect it to Zerodha,and I will then go here,and I will log in,and once I do that,I am inside the world of smallcase.So once I do that,I am inside the world of smallcase.Once you have logged in,you can see the componentsof all the smallcases,assuming that they are free.For example, as I showed youRising Rural Demand smallcase.If I go to stocks and weights,I will be able to see all the stocksthat this smallcase would be buying.It will buy the stocks ofbuilding products like Ambuja,Heidelberg Cement, Prince Pipes,Supreme Industries.You may not have heard their names,but these are the companiesthat are focused on the rural sector.Similarly, if you go toIndian Middle Class,then in paints, there is Asian Paintswhich is a very good company,in automobiles,there is Bajaj Auto for two-wheelers,Hero for two-wheelers,Maruti for four-wheelers,Home Electronics, Crompton Greaves,Whirlpool India, so on and so forth.If you go to House of Tata,then there is Tata Chemicals,Consumer, Elxsi, Power Company,Tata Steel, all the usual suspectsof Tata Group, but they are ina certain ratio.Why is this ratio there?That is completely developed by research,and that is what you are riding onwhen you go through this proper process.So this is how you connect smallcaseand your Demat account.Then the second piece isbuying into a smallcase.Buying into a smallcaseis very very simple providedyour Demat account is already connected.As you can see on the screen,All Weather Investing,this is my favorite recommended smallcaseif you have never bought any smallcase,or even if you have not startedyour stock investing journey.You get a balanced portfolioin All Weather Investing.What does All Weather Investing have?It has gold which is around 40%.It has equity which is around 40% again.This equity is also divided into parts,one is the junior piecewhich are small caps,and another is Nifty50 which is the top 50stocks of the Indian Stock Exchange.And then debt,which is again fixed income,so you will get a guaranteed returnlike Fixed Deposit, but of course,better performing, which is around 20%.So you can see, it's a good combinationof gold, equity, and fixed income.Got forbid if the equity marketis not doing well, then goldand fixed deposit can maintain it.If the equity market would be doing well,and gold and fixed income might be less,then the equity market will givea good performance.When you do this, overall you will be ableto get a good rate of return.So in the last four years,this All Weather Investinghas given 12.27% which is not bad at all,because the risk in it isabsolutely minimum,since there is gold in it,and there is fixed income in it.You can start with this â¹5328 only.What kind of Hindi am I speaking?!But you get the drift!You can start with this â¹5328which is as low as it gets,and the access is absolutely free.This means you will not be chargedanything to do this.What are the charges for smallcase?That will come in the next section,but at least for now, you can assumethat is free.You will have to log in to invest.Once you log in, you will have toenter whatever is the amount.If you want you can investmore than â¹5328.It's not necessarythat you have to create a SIP,or you have to invest every month,you can invest one time in a lump sum,everything is in your control.I, of course, would recommendthat you do a monthly SIP, but ifyou do not have that predictable income,you are a student,you have some money to invest,or you are a freelancer andyou do not know when your money comes,then you can invest whateverlump-sum you have, and whenever you havemore money, you can reinvest in it.This will always be free,so that is a good thing.As you start, it will be free foreverand ever for you.And then the third thing is rebalancing.Now rebalancing is very important,because rebalancing is basically saying,when we bought a smallcase,it's not necessary thatwhatever stocks we bought,or in whatever ratiowe bought those stocks,it's still the right thing.Because the market changes,conditions change, industries change,it is possible that a companyis not performing well,then some other companycan take its place,or a company is performing really wellso we put weightage on it.That is a process of rebalancing.So the experts of smallcase,they spend that time on this every day,this is their job 24/7that they do for you.And when they feelthat this requires an update,they will send you an email,which will be,it's time for you to rebalance.Whenever you would have to rebalance,you will come back tothe smallcase site or app,and through 2 clicks, go throughthe entire rebalancing process.Let's see how this works.As you can see on the screen,these are my smallcases,and we will try to rebalanceone of these smallcases,which is Capitalmind Momentum.You will click on rebalance,and it will clearly show you,what is the rebalancethat they are suggesting.So when you click on 'review update',you will see all the stocksthat you are buying,there are 10 stocks that have been boughtand what are their quantities.So the new quantity is 21,and it is changed fromthe previous quantity by 1.Balrampur Chini, new quantity is 74,which has changed by 6from the previous quantity.Which are the stocks that we are selling?So we are selling CDSL,and that is somethingwhich was 34 earlier,and now we are selling 1 unit of it.We are selling all of Tata Chemicals,so on and so forth.And there are stocks that are unchanged,so they remain as it is,and there is nothing therethat you have to do.So when you review all of it,and you can at any point in time,change that,you will click 'confirm update'.That is when it will tell youif there is some amountthat you will have to invest,this amount is usually a small amount.So it is a function of,like I have invested around â¹9 lakh in it,so there is an up-down of â¹1K-2Kbecause the stocks keep varying.And it will also tell you somethingvery important,how much are you selling that day,how much are you buying,and there is a market rule that says,for whatever amount you are selling today,you can spend only 80% of it today itself,you can spend the remaining 20% onthe next trading day.So in case, your buying and sellingdon't balance out from a value perspective,then smallcase gives you an alertthat this is not balanced,and we will see how that works.But for now, you will seethat my sell value is â¹56,000,buy value is â¹57,000,but today I can use only 80% ofthe sell value which is 56.So when I click on 'rebalance smallcase',it shows me that.It says, you can use only 80% of â¹56,000which is â¹44,000 today,but buy value is â¹57000,so you will have to pay for the gap,which is â¹12,400.Right now, there are only â¹1,000in your Demat account,then you have two options.Either you add funds,which is perfectly fine,I would say, don't add, move on.The second option is, you continue anyway.So when you continue anyway,then all the transactionswhich can happen today,will be completed, and then tomorrow youcan complete the remaining transactionswith the 20% amount that you will get.So you will continue anyway.Confirm orders.And when you click on that,then it will go through this.Placing your order.Waiting for order status.And it will then go throughall of the transactions that are possible.So 13 or 14 transactions are possible.We did not have the money tobuy the stocks of Grindwell,which we all knew, and that is somethingthat you can now come back tomorrowand repair the order.If you would have added the fundstoday itself, then you would have beenable to go through it completelytoday itself,nothing else would be required to do.As you place these orders,you can go to your Demat account,this is my Zerodha account,you can see that all those orderswould have been placed,which is what I was telling youis one of the benefits of smallcase,that the total ownership is directlyin your Demat account, nobody else has it,smallcase doesn't have it.It is in your Demat accountin your control, and you canat any point in time, buy them, sell them,and you don't have to do anythingwith smallcase...The fourth section, charges for smallcase.Charges for smallcase are of 3 types.Number 1, the charges by Smallcase.Number 2, the charges by Demat.And number 3, the subscription charges.Let's talk about these 3.Number 1, what are the chargesof Smallcase?So you will see for all smallcasesyou will have to give a one-time feewhich is â¹100 plus GST, meaning â¹118.You will have to pay this irrespectiveof any smallcase,whether it is is paid or free,whether you have spentâ¹1 lakh or â¹1,000 on it.No, actually I stand corrected.If your investing amount isless than â¹4000,then you will have to pay2.5%, and not â¹100.So 2.5% would usually be less for â¹4000,so let's say, if you arespending only â¹1,000,then you will have to pay â¹25 onlyfor that smallcase.That is the only charge that smallcasehas for all its smallcases irrespectiveof whether it is free or paid.After that, there are brokerage charges.These charges are relatedto your Demat account.So what are these charges?First of all, if you take thedelivery of the stock,which means you are not sellingthe day you are buying it,then that's called a delivery.So Zerodha, for example, doesn't chargeanything as brokerage.There is ETF, or Exchange Turnover Fee,which is 0.00325% of the traded value.So the value of the stockthat you have bought,you will have to pay 0.00325% of it,GST will be charged on it.GST will be levied on brokerage also,but brokerage is zero.Then there is STT,which is Securities Transaction Tax,which is 0.1% of the traded value.There is stamp duty,which is 0.01% of the traded value,but it varies according to the state.There are SEBI charges, which are0.0002% of the traded value again.And then there areDemat charges per stock.This is important to know,it doesn't depend on the value,it depends on the unique stocks and itonly applies when you are selling stocks.So if you would be selling 5 stocks,then you will have to pay for 5 stockswhich will be, 13.5 would be on CDSL,or 12.5 if you would be on NSDL.What are CDSL and NSDL?These are depositories where your stocksactually rest.To give you a sense of how it works,I have put it on an excel sheet.So on the Excel sheet,if we have bought and sold stocksworth â¹5,000, and we sold five stocks,irrespective of how much we bought,then the brokerage is already 0%,ETF would be0.00325%, so you will pay â¹0.163.GST is 18%, so you will pay â¹0.3.Securities Transaction Tax is 0.1%,so you will pay â¹5.Stamp duty is 0.015%,so you will pay â¹0.75.SEBI charges are 0.0002%,so you will pay â¹0.01.And you will give 15.93 on CDSLand 14.75 on NSDL,which is basically 13.5 or 12.5 plus GST,since we considered 5 stocks,so we will either pay â¹80 or â¹73.So total-total, you will pay â¹86 on CDSLand â¹80 on NSDL, which comes out to be1.7% or 1.6% on the value of â¹5,000.What you will note is,it is a pure function of thenumber of stocks that you are selling,because that is the most expensive thing.If this becomes one, then automaticallyyour percentage of value goes down,because everything is a functionof your traded value.The third cost of Smallcase is fora subscription.So what is a subscription?Some smallcases our research-heavy,expertise-heavy, they are not freebut they are paid.And there are many subscription options.The bigger one is what is calledthe Windmill subscription option.So for example, if I go here,this is CANSLIM-esque.This is a technique of investment,this is called the CANSLIM methodology,I have taken the subscription.If I click on the details,then you can see that you can buythe subscription for â¹800 a month,or â¹2,000 for a quarter,or â¹6,000 for a year.My recommendation would beâ¹6,000 for a year,but, there is a very important but towhat I'm about to say.The good thing about this is,let me explain it to you first,when you buy this...
