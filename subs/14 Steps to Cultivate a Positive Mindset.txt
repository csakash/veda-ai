Check 1, 2.Number 1 - Practisegratitude. Expressgratitude. Wheneveryou express gratitude, the positivethings in our lifecome before our eyes.And here's a greatway of doing that -by making a gratitude jar.Take an utensil ora fish bowl, whatever is available.And everyday,before you go to bed,write on a chit,'I am gratefultodayfor_____.'Whatever it is.If nothing has happened in your daythat you are grateful for,then simply write'I amgrateful todaythat I am alive.'Everyday,if you express this gratitude,slowly and gradually,you will start your daywith a positive mind.When you are aware thatin life there mightbe many problems,many issues, many hindrances,you actually have somethingto be thankful for.Number 2 - Focus on solutions.It is said thatevery individual has problemsbut to be able to find thesolution, to think about it,to be able to dedicate and devoteone's attention towards it,can be found in very few people.So whenever there is any issue,put yourselfin front of that issueSo whenever there isany issue in lifeand you find yourselfin front of any problem,of course take your momentto expressall the emotions that you aregoing through.There is drilling happening somewhere.At any point in life,if there is any issue or hindrance,then of course take your momentto go through the emotions,there will be a littlesadness, disappointment,but then,think of how you can come out of it.What is the solution for that?What can be done?So become solution-focusedand that will change your lifeforever and ever.Here's an example -you came back from an interviewand the interviewdid not go well andyou are dejected.Because this was probably the5th or 10th or 15th interview.And you are feeling very lowbut a solution-focusedmindset will say,'Whatever has happened is done.How can I fix this?'And they will sit downand think aboutwhich were the thingsthat might take metowards a rejection?Maybe the answer was not correct,or my credentials were not correct,or fitmen was not correct,I made a mistake here,I did not speak confidently.Whatever the reason is,you will make a list.And then you will ask,'Which are the mostimportant reasons out of these?'You will write them accordingly.And then you will ask,'How can I fix or improve this?'And then you will goahead and do that.I did mention.Actually I will tell 14 things -7 things are difficult, 7 thingsare very easy which can getyou started so that you have anice happy mix ofhow to bring in thepositive mindset.So this is a difficulttask, for sure.But to get the solution-mindsetis very importantto bring about that positive mindsetin you. For example,many students who want to go abroadto study, often say,'How will we arrange the loan?'For example, many peoplewho want to go aborad to studyFor example, many students whowant to go abroad to study,they often say,"How will we manage the fees?Where will we get the loan from?How will we be able to manage livingexpenses? How will wemanage accomodation?"And the solution mindset will be -"How can we get the scholarship?Let's try and figure that out.What will we have todo for a scholarship?Which essays will we have to write?Which universitiesprovide a scholarship?Where we can get ascholarship for how much?"And that will be a way for you toreduce the burden.This video is sponsored byLeverage Edu, which is India'stop study abroad consulting firm,and the scholarship deadlinesspecifically for UKare in this month of May.So if you are going to the UK,but you yet do not haveclarity about how to fund it,then applying to scholarshipscould be a great wayfor you to consider.Leverage Edu can helpyou in this journeybecause they have the expertise,connections and awarenessthat how you can begiven a scholarship.They don't guarantee, but theycertainly guarantee to help youwith everything that they canwith their team.The founder, Akshay Chaturvedi,is an ISB alumand a good friend.

Pleasetake it for what it is worth.But if you are interested,in applying for scholarshipsto the UK admission cycle this year,then the link is in thepinned comment and description,clicking which,you can book a session.Number 3 - Reframe negative thoughts.Negative thoughtsare a natural gravitysucking element.Whenever we come ina negative mindset,we say, 'We can't do this.They will leave us.No one will love us.I won't be able to win here.I won't be able to clear that exam.I won't be able toclear that interview.'But there is a possibility for youto reframe these negative thoughtsinto areal thought.I am not saying positive.I am not telling you toforcefully put a positive mindset.But a real thought can come.Here's an example -one negative thought is'I will never be able toclear this exam.'But a reframed,real thought of this is,reframed, realthought is,A reframed, real thought of this is,'I will have to workvery hard to clear this exam.And in the beginning, that hard workwill be very difficult.It will seem very tough.But I think I can get there.I have done this before as welland maybe this time as well,I can do it.'When you reframe that,it becomes a real thought, right?I did not lie aboutanything in this. I didnot force it saying,'Oh! You can do it!You have the power in you!May the force be with you!'I did not try toforce the positivity.You are reframing something which isself-limiting.By not adopting a negative approach,you are adopting a real approach,and that helps youbring in the positivemindset that 'You know what,it maybe possible.Let's do it and see.'Number 4 - Practisemindfulness.Mindfulness is one such technique,a way of living life,where youare mindful,which means thatyou live in the present.You cannot change your past.Without worrying about your future,in the current moment,whatever it is that you want,you devote 100%of your attention to it.That is called being mindful.Now how to practisethis mindfulness?First way can be toconsciously force yourselfto pay attention,but it becomes hard.So a great way to do that ismeditation. Meditationis a science, a techniquethrough which you can practisehow to become mindful.I have been meditating foralmost 7 years now.And since the last1390 days,I think 1390 was the last count,I haven't missed a single day.I meditate everyday for30 minutes and in those 30 minutes,I don't listen to anyone,nobody is telling me anything,I only listen to the soundsof birds, wind and water, andclose my eyesand try to focus onmy breath.And the idea isthat you cannot stop your thoughts,because we are humans andour thoughts will definitely come.You can only becomefamiliar with your thoughts.Which means whateverthought is coming in your mind,like 'Oh, I had to complete that.I had to talk to them.Will this happen inmy life or not? I amworried about thisthing.' Whatever it is,youwill accept that thought,be aware of it,and then come back to your breath.You accept thatthought,you will accept it,and then againfocus on your breath.And when you do this,then you will letgo of that thought.And this is called mindfulness.So, in real life,imagine you are talking to someone,and suddenly your mind wanders.It is in some other direction.Several thoughts come in.It can be anything.The range could be really wide.If you practise this mindfulnesstechnique through meditation,you will be able to applyit in real life as well.You will realize that thisthought is distracting you,you will accept that thought,you will not disregardor dismiss or try to stop it,you will accept it,and then you've come backto the present.And that will keep yousane.You will neither thinkmuch about your pastnor your future,and whenever you think,you will accept itand again come in the present.Number 5 - extremely important -surround yourselfwith positive people.How much ever you can keeppositive people around you,your positive mindsetwill be that strong.This is definite.But I also understand that thisis not always possible.Whenever I make this statement,many people say thatour parents itself our not positive,our siblings are not positive,our friends are not positive,and I understandthat we cannot changecertain relations.We cannot break offfrom certain relations.But we can becomemove out from them.And I am not suggesting thatyou forget your parents,do not care or do not respectthem. No.But it is not necessarythat you stay with them.This is an important decisionthat we make in our life.If your parents are not correctfor you, for whatever reason,in the right amountor in the right manner,then it isfar more importantfor you to move outso that you save that relation.Stay near them.Whenever they need help, help them.Love them.But staying with themis not necessary.Same goes for your siblings.If it is about friends,you have a choice.You can remove thosefriends from your lifewho influence younegatively always.They think negatively about you,or they think about negative things,or they talk negatively,they bitch, complain. They onlythink about rumours,gossip.All of this will bringyou down collectively.Because this can never bebeneficial for a positive mind.Surround yourselfwith positive people.Those people who think positively,discuss about ideas,talk about work,those who talk about work,those who talkabout work,those who talk about learning,moving on, those who are not juststuck in the past,those who don't just worryor complain about the future,in the present momentthey motivate you witha solution mindset as well,they inspire you.Number 6 - Setachievable goals.This is a very important anda very interesting technique.Often in our life,we get stuck in negative self-talk.But try thinking about where thisnegative self-talk comes from?It often comes when we areunable to achieve our goals.And worse, when we are unable toachieve our growth as well asthat timeline on which we hadfixed the goal for ourselves.So you would not just say that 'Iwant to buy a house.'You will also say, 'Iwant to buy a house till I turn 30.'You will not just say, 'Iwant to buy an iPhone.'You will say, 'I want to buyan iPhone before I turn 23.'Why are you forcefullycreating pressure?Number 1 - Achievable goals.Number 2 - Please do not attacha timeline with those goals.In life, it does not matter at whichpoint you reached that goalbecause you will neverbe that late. Andeven if you are,to be able to reach that goal,is the success.Not the fact when you reached there.If you get that house at the age of31, 32, 33, instead of 30,you will yet be happy in lifeif you want to be.But if you even get the house at 30and you are not happy about it,then what have you even achievedin those 30 yearsby getting that house?Don't setunachievablegoals. Don't make thosepromises with yourself whichyou know you cannot fulfill.Don't make that promise.Don't get up and say,'Tomorrow onwards, everyday,I will go to the gym.'Because when you don't do that,your mind tells you'You won't be able to do it.You onlykeep talking.You cannot fulfill it.'And that will get youinto that negative spiralwhich you want to escape from.Please setachievable goals.Don't make promises to yourself.Try to put yourself in a process.Something that you can doevery single daywithout worryingabout where it will take you.That will surprisingly bethe way that you build yourselfpositively.And number 7 -scientifically proven -the best wayto remain positively fitis to stayfit physically.Your physical healthhas a direct consequenceon your mental health as well.Every single day, 30 minutes,exercise. Any form of activity.It can be walking,swimming, running,taking your dog for a walk,walking with your friends,it can be any sport,it can of course be the gym,it can be yoga, aerobics,dance, anythingthat gets you physically active.Your heartbeat should get raised,you should be sweating,you should feelgood about that factthat you have a bodyand that will instantlyhave an impacton your mental well-being as well.It is scientificallyproven that physicalfitness and activityfor only 30 days,for only 30 minutes a day,is one and a halftimes more effectivethan any medicationto help with anxiety and stress.I will repeat it.Everyday, only30 minutes of exercise,or physical activity,is one and a half timesmore effectivethan any other medicationfor anxiety and stress.It's crazy that wehave received this body,for free, and yet while wekeep investing in medication,therapist,psychologist, psychiatrist,we are wasting our lifewhen we havethe control to take charge of it.Now let's move to 7easy wayseasy ways to makea positive mindset.Come, let's start.Number 1 - smile more often.It is crazy that it's true.If you smileforcefully as well,it is proven to help you getto a positive and bettermindset.Here's my hack -everyday after waking up,whenever you stand infront of the mirror,for whatever reason,look into the mirror,look into your eyes,and smile.Just smile.Force yourself to smile if youaren't feeling that smile from within.But do that.And it will change your life.I guarantee you it willchange yourlife.Try that.Number 2 - uplifting musicor uplifting videos.Often people say,'I get a lot inspirationafter watching your videos.'Great. If the algorithm wouldhave not put this video today,or I stop recording,or you could not watch it,where else would you getthat inspiration from?Is your inspirationdependent on chance?That if YouTube's algorithm works,we will watch theinspirational video, if it does notwork, we will something else. No.You can't leaveinspiration to chance.Inspiration needs to be a decision.If you want to bringa positive mindsetwithin yourself,uplifting music,uplifting videos,uplifting content,consume it actively as a discipline,literally like you dofor eating everyday,wearing clothes daily,bathing daily.Watch uplifting, inspirational,motivational contentin the same way daily.I remember I used to do that foralmost 4 years everyday,while travelling from home to officewhen I was running Nearbuyfrom 2015 to 2019.Every single day when I havetravelled from home to officeI have spent that half an hourwatching something motivationalor inspirational, like a TED talkor a motivationaltheme, or an interview,or a songwhich gives you goosebumpsand it gives a beliefthat you can do it.That it is not yet over.And that just lifts youfor the day and ifyou do that everyday,your mindworks in the same way as well.Number 3 - it is crazythat this is true again -Vitamin D.Sunshine.Go out andlet the suninteract with your body.Don't sit in this cocoon.Don't spend your dayonly sitting at home. Go out.It isprovenby researchthat the lack of Vitamin Dis 60% the reasonfor all hospitalizations.Can you imagine? I will repeat it.60%, this is the data from the US,60% ofall hospitalizations in the UScould have been preventedif they would have receivedVitamin D in adequate amount.That shocking.It's free.The sun is free.The wind is free.Going out is free.Your body is free.Your mind is free.Please go out,take sunshine,make Vitamin D,and move towardsa positive mindset.Number 4 -forgive.Forgive people.Forgiveness is a beautifulway, and proven again,to generate a positive mindset.Whenever you willfullyforgive people from within,you actually move on.And you let go off the stressand the anxiety that comes withholding that grudge against someone.Think about it.Whenever we hold a grudgetowards someone,we hold anger, resentment,it requires effort.We have to actively think aboutus being angry at someone,what they have done,we have to behavein a particular way,it takes a lot of effort.But if youforgive that person,you move on,you actually are able to let goand you empty your mindfrom all the negative talkthat you are consumed by.Forgive people.Forgive situations.Number 5 -help.Be kind.WheneverWhenever you help people,it makes you feelgood about yourself.And if you genuinelydo that as a habit,you will feel more positiveabout yourselfand the world.And this is again proven.So you have to help people.If people ask you for help,or even if they don'tbut you attentively seewhom you can help and why.And it need not be a very big helplike giving moneyor changing someone's life. No.It's as simple asif anyone is lookingfor a pen in the officeand you give them that pen.Someone is looking for someoneand you make them awareof where they are.Or somebody is saying,'Can someone check thispresentation to give me feedback?'and you volunteer and offer to help.Not with any expectation attached.Nothing. Because whenever you dosomething to whichexpectation is attached, that isnot help, that is a transaction.So we don't have todo a transaction.We have to help.And the surest way to do thatis to do itabsolutely with no expectations.You will feel positiveand great about yourself.Number 6 -engage in activities whichmake you happy.In every person's life,there is some activity doing whichmakes them happy.It can be anything.It can be playing with kids,it can be playing with pets,it can be playing a sport,listening to music, watching movies,making or learning orteaching something,whatever the case maybe,do something everyday whichgives you happiness.Because negativemindset and mindframe comes whenyou do something whichdoes not make you happy.And if you connectall these things in your life,and add a happinesselement as well,you will only get more foodfor your positive mind.And number 7 - perhaps the mostimportant thing in today's world -unfollow every personon social mediaconsuming whose contentgives you negative feelings.And when I say that,it does not necessarilyrelate to those people whoknow you.They need not be yourrelatives, family or friends.It can also be aninfluencer or creatorwatching whosecontent makes you feellike you have notdone anything in life.That person who shows offwith their success or beautyor achievements, whetherdeliberately or subconsciously,and thatmakes you feel bad,makes you feel inferior.They make you feel like you havenot achieved anything in your life.And whosoeverthat person is, howeverhelpful they are trying to be,remove them, unfollow them.For example, if watching this videomakes you feel like'Whenever I watch these videosfrom Ankur Warikoo, I feel likehe is very sorted,he has lived his life nicely,he is 42 years,he has kids, family,money, everything,now he is spreading knowledge.And whenever he spreads knowledge,it makes me feel veryinferior about my lifethat I have not achieved anything.I am so far.Will I even be ableto reach there ever or not?'And if you feel that way,I am not good for you.I am not good for you.And you should unfollow meand everyone like me.Because this is not helping you.You don't just wantnon-sense contentwhich does notrequire much thinking,some movie or song or comedywhich does not require thinking,just chilling and moving on. No.Something that gets you tothink, something that gets you toponder, somethingthat gets you to act,but something that forces youto think in such way that yougo in a completelyopposite direction,that instead of acting,you start feelingshitty about yourself,stop doing that to yourself.Unfollow everyone on social mediaconsuming whose content makes youfeel inferior about your life.When you bring these14 things together,you will take the first steptowards a positive mindset.And trust me,in today's world,in today's world,if someone has a positive mindset,someone has a clear mindset,they are focused,and more importantly,they are positive,you aregold.Because the world todayis strugglingwith this very thing.They are feeling helpless.Theyfeel like this negative self-talk,this negative world,these negative worst-case scenarios,are paralyzing their entire life.And if you can freeyourself from this,then that is the best giftyou can give yourself.I hope this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo,signing off.
