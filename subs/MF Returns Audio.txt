How are returns on mutual fund understood?What is absolute return, CAGR, XIRR?You'll find out all, in this video.Friends, often,when we are comparing a mutual fund,for that matter,if we are comparing any investment,so, mostly itâs talked in terms of return.And it is very importantto understand these returnsbecause many people get confusedthat what is absolute return?What is CAGR?  What is XIRR?Don't worry if you are not awareabout all these things.The purpose of this videois to explain you.Let me start with a question.There are two friends.One friend,invested Rs. 1 lakh somewhere.It's not necessary where,but did.And that 1 lakh of his became 1.50 lakhsWell, the other friend,he also invested Rs. 1 lakh.But his 1 lakh became 1.75 lakh.Now tell me this,out of these two,who made the best investment?Pause the video.Write in the comment sectionand then come back to this video.For two seconds, pause.So, at this point,Piyush, run a clock,tick, tick, tick, tickand then come back.You can't answer this question.Because this question is incomplete.The biggest mistake youâll make is,that you will say, oh!if 1 lakh turned into 1.5or turned into 1.75,then naturally 75is more than 1.50,So, the other friendmade a better investment,But there is a very important component,that in how much timedid this investment increase?If the first friend's 1 lakh,grew to 1.50 in just two years,but the second friend's 1 lakhturned into 1.75 after 10 years,then the answer will not be the same,it will be very differentand to know this,three different approaches are employed.Come, let's understand these three.So, Iâll do the Loom recording, Piyushyou will find that recording alsoin the Google Drive.So, first of all, let's understandwhat is absolute return?Because it's the easiest,but also, the most misleading.So, suppose,your initial investment that was therelike I told,was 1 lakhand your final investmentor the final amount that is,it comes to,suppose, 1.50 lakh.So, absolute return,which people often calculate,that is simple.Final amountdivided by initial amountminus one.And if you convert this into percentage,you will get 50%.Now, you can change this number.Now, this, if I take a different number,so Rs. 1,21,980,if that becomes 1,50,000,then your absolute return is now 23%,But why is absolute return misleading?Because it doesn't tell you the timethat it took for the initial investmentto become the final amount.Thatâs very important, friend.Because if the same amountis made within 2 yearsor within 7 years,it makes a huge difference.So, if you want to comparetwo investments,absolute returnis never the way to compare.And that's why never use it.If any app,shows you absolute returns,it is just trying to hidehow many years it tookto generate that absolute return.Even if I,to create a sensation on my thumbnailshow you 1000% absolute return,100% absolute return,then you also will question me and saythat, Ankur, this is wrong, friend.for click bait, you've put 100% returnbut that is absolute.It didn't show in how many years it cameand that's why,I'm not going to watch that video.And that will make me honest.And I've done this two or three times.So, I'll be the first one to admit.So, how to solve it?To solve this,everything got doneto an annual return.Because annual return becomes comparable.If I tell you that one mutual fundis giving 15% returnand one mutual fund is giving 18% returnthen it suddenly becomes easier, right?because I know thatif I compare 15% return and 18% return,then 18% return is morebecause it is an annualized return.For this, the second wayof calculating returns was introduced,called CAGRor compounded annual growth rate.Taking the time period into account,it calculates the return.How does it work?Letâs try and understand.So, because time is important in CAGR,we will enter a dateand then put the amount.So, suppose,I made an investment on 1st January, 2017.And let's say,did the same, Rs. 1,21,980and then my, 1st January 2022,this year,the same amount 1,75,000--had become 1,75,000.Now this, again will do the same thing.If I have to find out the absolute return,then what is it?This final amount minus this, so 43.5.But again, as I said,itâs misleading,so what will I calculate?Iâll calculate something called CAGR.What is the formula for CAGR?The formula for CAGRis final amountdivided by initial amountto the power 1 by the number of years.So, in 2017, 1st January and in 2022, 1st January,how many years were there? Five.Five minus one.And when I do this and convertthis into a percentage,I get a formula, 7.5%.CAGR of this thing is 7.5%.Now, what does that actually mean?It meansthat if we assumethat original amountof yours, Rs. 1,21,980,that if every yearkeeps increasing by 7.5%then within 5 years,that amount will become 1,75,000.Letâs try and show how that works.So, you started on 01/01/2017then 01/01/2018,01/01/2019,01/01/2020,01/01/2021,and then 01/01/2022, fine?In 2017 which amount did we start at?Rs. 1,21,980,and now we have increased the same amount,with what?With this return,which was 7.5%.And when we increased this return,so, next year, if we withdraw our money,then we withdraw around Rs. 1,31,000.And if we keep increasing this,you will see, it will reach1,75,000 in 2022.That is what CAGR means.If you put one penny at one time,and then at another timein the future, take it off,so how much annual returnwill their difference generateover their years?This becomes a really good way to compare.Because if a mutual fund saysthat our 3-year CAGR,3-year CAGR is 15%and another mutual fundsays that our 3-year CAGR is 18%,then you know that in the last 3 years,in the first mutual fund,my money has grownat an average of 15% yearly,And in the other mutual fundhas grown by approximately 18%.So, clearly the second one maybe betterin terms of the returnsgenerated annually.It is important that you understand,this does not meanthat every year, guaranteed your moneywill increase by 7.5%.This is not an FD, mate.This is a mutual fundor any other assetwhere there is volatilityof the stock market,so it is possible that actually,this is your return,but actually,it may be that your money that was there,this money that was there,which you started Rs. 1,21,980,maybe the next year it became 1,30,000then after that became 1,20,000,then after that became 1,40,000after that again it went to Rs. 1,35,000,as the market sankand then the market grew exponentiallyand reached Rs. 1,75,000.That could be the reality.I am not suggesting that is.But, this means that CAGRwon't tell you what actually happens?It will tell you that at the end of it,if you take a start and an end amountand take the duration between them,then on an averagewhat will be that returnon an annual basis?Do you understand?Now, what is the big challenge for CAGR?This does not include regular paymentswhich happens to be SIPs.Because it assumes that youâve investedmoney in lump sum all at onceand then all at onceyou withdrew that moneyand the difference between thatwill create my CAGR.But now if I saythat on 1st January, 2017,I had invested Rs. 1,21,980,But then 1 lak--On 1st January 2018once again invested Rs.1,00,000.Received a bonus from the company.Then in 2019,I invested only Rs 35,000because that yearwanted to go on vacation.So, only Rs 35,000 went there.Then on January 1st, 2020,I did not add anything.There was no money.Then in 2021,I invested a lot of money,Rs. 1,50,000And in 2022,this entire amount that was there,which is Rs. 4,00,000,this had become Rs. 5,00,000.To ascertain the CAGRof this will be very difficult.Why? Because you will have to ascertainthe CAGR of each one.But you do not knowexactly which contributioncame at which point.Because it was spread across the time.So, to solve this,where you are contributing regularlyor even if not doing it regularly,on a random date,doing a random contributionand also randomly withdrawing it,then it is not necessarythat you wait till the end.You withdraw some SIP in the interim.Then wait until the end as well.The formula to calculate all these thingsis called XIRRor extended internal rate of return.Don't go on the full formbecause there is nothing to fear.Basically, think of it like CAGRwhere annualized rate of return comes inbut the complexity is,that here it takes the datesand not just the year.So, letâs try and do itwith this exact return.so here to calculate XIRRcertain specific nuances in EXCELhave to be changed.The first and foremost,whenever you are contributingor investing an amount,so that amount is going from your pocket,so that will be considered as negative.Whenever you are liquidating the amount,means by selling the investmenttaking the money back,that amount is coming back to your bank,so that will be considered as positive.And on every such activity,whether it is investment or withdrawal,you will assign a date.It doesn't have to be a regular date.Like I've put the year here,I will show exactlyhow it can be included even in days.It doesn't have to be just every month.Be every year. Be on the same date.It could be anything randomand XIRR will still work.Letâs see how that worksSo that was the amount.We will apply minus on this.Because this is minus.Minus in the second one also.Minus in the third one too.Minus in the fourth one too.And the fifth one is our Rs. 5,00,000,the amount that came out.Now for this,if we have to find the returnthen we will use the formula XIRR,bracket, whatever your values are.And against it,whatever your dates are.Dates will always comein date, month, year format.You canât write the date you want.Because EXCEL will not include it.When you do this and you calculate it.You get a percentagewhich is the XIRR, 6.6%.This means,if you make your investments in this way,and at the end of the investmentswithdraw Rs. 5,00,000.So, you have receivedan annual return of 6.6%.Which you can now use to comparewith anything else that you do.Now you can imagine,how powerful will be this be for SIPs.Because, letâs try and do that.So, first of all,let's talk about 2022. All right?In 2022 we created an SIP of Rs. 10,000.And now,on 3rd October 2022I am recording this videoSo, let's say...So, assume every month since 2022you started an SIPand in that SIPyou invested Rs. 10,000 per monthand that SIP of yours is activeand on 1st October, 2022,you closed this SIP.And you earned Rs. 1,20,000.Now, letâs do the basic math.How much investment did you make?Your investment was Rs. 90,000.So, you have invested Rs. 90,000.Have earned Rs. 1,20,000 out of that.So, what is your net profit?Rs. 30,000.So, your absolute return is 30,000.But what does XIRR say?The XIRR saysthat if I take all these amountsand their corresponding datesand then will do this,I will get 95%.How did this happen?This happens because,XIRR is based on annualized returns.Our year is not over yet.It has been only nine monthswhere we have put moneyand then at one point,we withdrew that money.So, it assumes that if at this pace,we keep doing this for 1 year,then how much return do we get in 1 year?Which in this case is 95%.If you make the same thing...90,000, meaning you didn't get any return.Whatever money you invested,the same money came back to you.and there is zero returnthat you have made.If the same thingis changed to Rs. 1,00,000,it comes to 28%, why?Because just in 9 monthsyou have earned Rs. 10,000on a base of 90,000.So, the same thing, if you extrapolateor extend for 12 months,Then your annualized returnwill sit close to 28%.This is the beauty of XIRR,that you can enter any date,whether it is a few months, a few yearsand it will still give youan annualized return.Which you can comparewith any other investment instrumentto get the returns.Now letâs do the something--Now letâs do something interesting,which is the final thingthat I will show you.That if you even donât have SIPs,you are very irregularSo, on 1st January 2022,you invested Rs. 10,000.On 1st February 2022, you said, buddy,more money has come,so you invested Rs. 20,000.Then you invested nothing in March.Then in April you invested only Rs. 2000.Then in May, again you invested nothing.Then more money came in,so you invested Rs. 30,000.Then, in July invested nothing.In August, you invested only Rs. 10,000.Even in September, you invested 10,000.And after doing all this,when you liquidate your money in October,you get XIRR 59%, why?Because the total moneythat you invested was 82,000.But here is the interesting thing,why did this grow?Almost is the same.And let's actually make this 18,000, yes.On 1st August you invested 18,000.Then in September you invested 10,000.And the same Rs. 1,00,000you withdrew in October.Now, totally how much money have you put?The same Rs. 90,000.So, how has your return grown now?How has it become 30%, why?Because most of the moneythat you had invested,was invested in the end.So, this is saying that buddy,on 1st June you added Rs. 30,000which was a big amountcompared to the rest of the contributionbecause until thenyou had only invested Rs. 32,000.So, you almost doubled it.And that too only in 3 months,from June to September.Increased so muchthat even then you have made Rs.1,00,000.So, it is actually grown fasterand thatâs why it is speedier.This is brilliantbecause you can nowuse it for anythingnot just for mutual fund.So, if you're really particular about it,you will say, I'll createan investment roster of my own,where, on which date,on which thing,I invest money, doesnât matter.It could be an FDfor your emergency fundNot for anything else.That you can put in mutual funds.You can put it in a small case.Can put in crypto. Can be put in gold.Can put it in real estate.It doesnât matter.And as when you liquidate it,you put the same thingand make a positive contribution in it.And keep calculating your XIRR.You will get a sense,about your total investmentgrowing at what annual growth rate.And this is what is super powerful.Because at the end of it,that is what you are measuring.So, these three,absolute return, CAGR, and XIRRare the waysthat you have to constantly thinkwhen you invest in any investment class.Whether it's a mutual fund.Whether it is real estate.Whether it is gold or anything else.And I hope,you were able to know through videothat whenever you try to measureany investment class with return,so what is that return actually saying?On that note,Ankur Warikoo signing off.In this Piyush,I've repeated many things multiple times.So, if you feel itâs getting boring,getting repetitive, cut it, fine?Donât wait for it.Make it as tight as possible.That us your art.Because, I'll keep speaking, as a teacher,but you as a student,have to take the easiestand the fastest outcome, okay?All the best. Thanks.
