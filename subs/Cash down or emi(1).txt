Okay, Piyush, no intro.Will go straight in.Fine, letâs go.There will be a lot of calculations,etc. in thisso, show all that on the screen.Make this very engaging.In this video will try to knowthat whenever you are buying something,buying a phone, buying shoes,buying clothes, or buying a car,anything else,should you pay in cash?Means should you pay in fullor can you convert it into an EMI?Now this is something which is a recentphenomenon in our country.Earlier we used to take loan,used to precisely apply for it.But now getting loan is almost instant.You may be about to buy somethingon Amazon, on Flipkart,and there it would be writtenconvert into zero-cost EMI.What does it mean?Will know in this videoFundamentally, you need to know that,that nothing is free in life.Zero-cost EMI is not zero cost.Someone is paying for it,either that is you,but you are being framed in a way,to assume or make believe the factthat it does not cost you anything,or there is someone elsewho is carrying this burden for you,and it is very important to know this.So, in this video,I will show four wayswhere zero-cost EMI is implementedAnd then I'll also give you my suggestionthat if you want to comparecash down and zero-cost EMI,then what will be a better approach?Let's start the first one with an example.Let's say you are buyinga phone worth â¹60,000,as if no one buys a phonebelow that nowadays.So, it is â¹60,000 phone.And as soon as you go to checkout,it is written there zero-cost EMI.Wow! Wow! Wow!This phone of yours is yours in six EMIsat only â¹10,000 a month,and you are like, hmm, what to do?To buy, not buy. Buy, not buy.Now let's understandwhat's going on behind in the background.Letâs say, that if you take a loanor if a bank is giving you a loan.Because someone is giving this â¹60,000to you, isn't it?Which you don't have right now,you will return that in six months.He gives you this loan at 10%,means at 10% interest.Means â¹60,000 for the yearand at 10% interestyou would have had to pay â¹6000 interest.So, in six monthsyou would have had to pay â¹3000 interest.Now what would happen,which is the first case of zero-cost EMI,that the actual cost of this phoneis 57,000 and not 60,000.So, if you pay in fullthen you would pay 57,000 for that phone.But if you convert it to zero-cost EMIthen you will give 60,000.Now you will never see this thing,it would be running in the backend.It will be a function of what you select,why you selected,and hence the price sometimeskeeps varying or remains hidden.Mostly if you are booking flights,booking hotels,so what price you click onand the price that you ultimately pay,that's entirely a different numberand that could be the reason,because in the backendsomeone is determiningthat this interest which has accrued,will get it paid by this customer itself.So, â¹3000 interest that has to be paid,that would be builtinto the product itself,which is the first waythat you make an EMI a zero-cost EMI.Another way is by chargingsomething called processing fee.And this processing feeis a very interesting thing.So in this example,assume you are buying something.Maybe a phone or some expensive clothes,which you are buying at â¹9000so MRP is 9000or whatever is the buying price, is 9000and you want to avail zero-cost EMI,so he tells you there is zero-cost EMI,you convert it to six equal installmentsWill have to pay only â¹1500 every monthand you can buy this thing for â¹9000within six monthsand you will become its owner today.Do you want to proceed?And you're like, yes proceed.And they say man, there is only one thing,in this, we will chargeonly â¹500 processing fee,only â¹500 not more, â¹500.And you're like, man â¹500 is nothing.Buying something worth â¹9000,at â¹500if you get such a long six-month loan,will have to pay â¹1500 every month,itâs still fine.But what did they do?Here is how it gets interesting.They didn't charge you any interest.They charged you a processing fee.But the processing fee that exists,that will actuallygo towards the interest itself.If you take a loan for six monthsand for that you pay â¹500 processing fee,means, on a yearly averagethat amount is â¹1000.So, to buy something worth â¹9000,on a yearly basis,paid â¹1000 extra.Which means a rate of interestgreater than 10%.So, technically the bank has already gotthe 10% rate of interest it wanted,but instead of calling it interested,they named it as processing feesand you got caught in its clutchesbecause that amount was very small.You never tried to calculateit in a percentage.So, this is the second wayhow ultimately a zero-cost EMIintroduces you to an expense.The third exampleis possibly the worst wayI do not want anyone watching this videoto repeat this third mistake,and that is the following,that after purchasingyou convert your purchase into EMI.This happens mostly with credit cards.So, what do the credit card companies say?It says man, you didn't have money now,even if it was, you are goingto give it only after a month.So, when sending the statement,they say, do you want to convertthis into an EMI?And people say, goodgot a one-month free period,letâs convert into six months,whatâs there to lose?But that is where you makea big cardinal mistake.Why? Because credit cardsnever give anything for free.So, forget zero-cost far and wide.Usually, they don't even mentionwhat will be your EMIby converting this thing.They just paste an EMIin your next monthly statement.Remember, credit card companiesoffer the most expensive loans.If you buy anything on a credit cardand next month donât pay that in full,you have to pay a yearly interest ofanywhere between 30 to 45% on that amount.And the same thing applies,if you convert that purchase into an EMI.Please do not ever make this mistake.Because this is a much worse optionthan the first two options.Which will just suck all the moneyfrom your pocket.and then comes the fourthand possibly the most interesting optionwhere zero-cost EMIis actually a zero-cost EMI.but how does it really work?Because I started the video withnothing is available for free.So, someone has to bearthe burden of this thingand that could be the platform itself.Mostly big platforms.So, if we talk about Flipkart, Amazon,so many a times they will say thisthat whatever interest amount it hasthat we will bear for the bank.Why? Because we want peopleto make this purchaseand this goes through the roofduring festival sales.So, when your Great India Festival happensor Big Billion Day happensor whatever that happens,all of those are where they want peopleto buy from their platform.They are taking out their phonesand their sneakers and their electronicsand what not.All of that will usuallyhave an association with the bank,where the bank will also say this man,you will get to disburse so much loanso, we will probably give loanat 9% instead of 10.And Amazon or Flipkart will also say man,we will bear the burden of this 9%.Because on an amount basisthat could be lower.Because they will try to sell youan EMI of three or six months.If that is the case,where there is actually no processing fee,there is no interest,there are no hidden charges,it could be that,that is a zero-cost EMI for you.This does not meanthat it is zero-cost EMI for the world.Because the platform most likelyis paying for it, on your behalf.But you don't care about thatso, you can avail that zero EMI.But here is my best suggestion, if at all.The best way to use zero-cost EMIis to actually use the fourth option.But you already have all the money.Let's understand this with an example.Same first example,â¹60,000 goes into a phone.So, you bought a phone for â¹60,000and you got a zero-cost EMI offer.This â¹60,000 phoneis actually worth â¹60,000,so even if you give cash down,so only 60,000 have to be given,and even if you convert that into an EMI,even then have to pay 60,000.So, there are no hidden charges in it.There is no processing fee either.And they say that you can takean EMI of â¹10,000 each for six months.And you sign up for that.But the smartest person will be,who has this 60,000 already ready,But despite that,he takes this EMI option.Why? What are they going to do,is they will put this â¹60,000into a short-term asset.That short-term asset can be anything.It can also be a fixed deposit.It could be a corporate bond.It could be a debt mutual fund.Anything that will generate you a returnanywhere between 4-5% on a yearly basis.Even if you are able to earn 5%on a â¹60,000 phone,so that means you will earn â¹3000 per yearas interest,and if you have taken it for six months,then â¹1500.That means this â¹60,000when you actually depositthen on that, on an average,yearly you will earn â¹1500and someone elsewill only ask for â¹10,000 per month,for six months.So net-net, your phonewill cost you 58,500,because that â¹1500you earned for yourself.This is actually the smarter wayand you can imagineas the value of the product increases,this becomes even better.If you bought a â¹1 lakh phonethen it is even better.If you bought a fridgefor â¹2 lakhs or â¹3 lakhsor have purchasedsome expensive furniture, or anything,but all that money is already with you,then imagine how big that quantum will beof even that small 4-5% interestthat you will earn per year,because you took an EMIat someone else's expenseand out of your own pocket,by investing in a fixed depositor a short-term asset,earned an income.This is the best answer to,should you buy cash downor should you buy an EMI?If you have the full cashand if you are getting a zero-cost EMI,then please use the zero-cost EMIand invest the entire cashin a short-term asset.If you don't have that moneyand getting a zero-cost EMI,so please take it,and you can still get accessto a product or a service that you wanted.If you don't have moneyand you are not getting zero-cost EMIbecause it is hidden or disguised,then please be wiseand not make that purchase.Wait, ask yourself again after 30 days,do I really need this thing?And most likely, the answer will be,probably not to the extentyou felt initially,and you may have saved yourself,some nice happy amount of moneyand financial distress.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
