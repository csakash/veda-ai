Check 1 2 check 1 2Aditya, this video is about my weekly calendar,so I will show the calendar on the screen,but I don't want the entire calendarto be there except for the early part,where people are just able to seehow much there is, but after thatwhen I am speaking on event and event,you basically need to zoom inand hopefully, the HD recording of Loomshould help.So that's how we want to do it.Let me just go back and start Loom.In this video, on popular demand,I will share with all of you myweekly schedule, so that you can seewhat I am able to do in a week,how do I do them,and why do I do those particular things?Friends, I recently asked this questionin the YouTube community tab,that if you want to know anythingpersonal about my life beyond financewhich is usually what I make,for careers, or startups,then what can it be?The number one thing that peoplesurprisingly wanted to know waswhere do you spend your time and how?So I thought let me make a video on that.In this video, I will show mycalendar view for you for the weekthat has gone by and the weekthat I am currently shooting in,and through that period of 14 days,you will broadly get to knowwhere does my time go,why does it go thereand how I think about it.Before that, let me give you abroad mapping of how I look at my time.First of all, my morning routineis extremely sacrosanct for me,it's very sacred, it's not mentionedon the calendar, it's in my mindand in a fierceful manner.I wake up early in the morningbetween 4:30-5 and the first thingthat I do once I get up isto have a glass of water.Since there is a slight nip in the air now,so I warm some water in the kettle,I warm my hands as well along with it.I take about 10-15 minutesto have that glass of water,just like we have wine,I don't drink wine,but just like we sip on it slowly.It is my way of getting up.There are so many thingson the mind at night, dreams,and other things, so you just needa nice calm way of entering into the day.Immediately after this,I meditate for half an hour.I use the Calm app for my30-minute meditation, it is nota guided meditation.I just listen to the sound oflake water and birds chirping.A bell rings after every 10 minuteswhich tells me that it is 10 minutes,and it rings 3 timesso it is done in 30 minutes.After that, I either read a bookor practice my singing,I am learning Indian classical musicso that's something that I door I read a book for about half an hour.And after that, I go to play tennissix days a week except for Saturdays,because I do Instagram live onFriday nights from 10 to 11,so I sleep late and hence wake up late.It's important for me to complete7-7.5 hours of sleep,so I don't go for tennis.Immediately after tennis,I go to the gym for half an hour to workout,come back by around 8:15 or so.After that, I take my bath,have my breakfast, and by about 9:30I'm at my desk starting my day.Because of this, as you willsee in my calendar, there is very rarelyany event that is starting before 10:00 a.m.Because when I sit at my laptop at 9:30,the first thing that I do isI check my emails, and my meetings,if I have any, start at 10:00.This morning routine setsme up for the day.There are so many people who wake upjust before they are about tostart their day, and then theyrush through the day.And whenever you do this,you don't give ample time toyour body, your mind, your emotionsto get ready, to actually think through the day,so my fundamental request toall of you is that if you wantto control your time properlythen please have a morning routine.It's not necessary to wake upearly in the morning,but it's necessary that you wake upat the same time every day,and before actually starting your day,you give some time to yourselfand do think that you like.Let's see where did my timego this week?Now I am doing screen recordingSo I am looking at the weekof October 18th, this is the weekbefore the week that I am shooting in.You can see on the top it'swritten Vaishnavi exam break.Vaishnavi is a team member in Waricrew,who takes care of the Instagram team.She is a student and she is currentlyon an exam break, so this calendar invitehas gone to all the team membersso that we always know whoall are on a break, and we have tofill in for that person.So we always enter all the detailsin the day slot about whoeveris having an exam or is on a holidayin the future as well.I have my Indian events as wellbut I have subscribed to a calendarso the main important thing is this.So first of all, on Mondayat 10:00 a.m. I had a briefing callwith BNY Mellon.BNY Mellon is a very large bank globally,one of the oldest in the world,if not the oldest in the world,and I am participating in one oftheir corporate events, so there wasa briefing call about what I have to sayin that event, so that wasa quick half an hour call.And after that from 11:30 till 1,I have my ads shoot.So on every Monday from 11:30 to 1I shoot my ads which you see on YouTube,I know you are bugged with them,I shoot all the ads for Instagramand everywhere else.We shoot 2-4 ads every week,to keep the ads recent, fresh,and in accordance with the feedbackthat we get, so all of that happens.From 1-2 pm, is usually my lunchtime,and almost every day from 2 to 3:30,I do not schedule anything exceptif it is pre-planned. I try tospend time just by myself from 2 to 3:30,I sleep for half an hour or an hour,read a bit, check my phone,this is my me time during the day,it is absolutely precious.I remember when I used to workI never got this kind of time,so my morning routine was evenmore important at that timebut since I have more controlover my time now, I value thisand a lot more.After that, I had a meeting withGurudev Prasad at 3:30 pm.He has run a very interesting start-up,and we wanted to do a podcast,so we did that together.Then I had a meeting with a company,which I cannot name, at 4:30 pm.I am doing digital consultingfor this company, so almost every weekI have one hour scheduled withtheir entire team, so that's what I did.And then at 5:30 pm, I hada very interesting call withsomeone named Frederick.Frederick is the India head ofthis company called Oriflame.Oriflame is a huge Swedish cosmetics companyand they have a big footprint in India,so he is the India CEO for that company,and he wanted to have anInstagram Live with me sometimelater in the day, which you will watch,so we had a briefing call aboutwhat we going to do in that Live,so on and so forth.Then at 6:30 pm with Western Union,it's a huge financial institutionespecially for money transfer,I was doing a panel discussion for them,so we had a briefing call for that.And then at 7 pm every weekevery Monday the entireWaricrew gathers.We call it our weekly huddleor more specifically our WBR,Weekly Business Review,so every Monday for an hour at 7:00 p.m.,we measure our data for thewhole week across all the platforms.So, all the platforms ownersgive details about, how didInstagram or Facebook or Twitteror Newsletter or YouTube or LinkedIn do?And then for half an hour,we just catch up on what ishappening in our lives.The one thing that we startedto do after lockdown is,we ask a question, about whichwe decide in the morning itself,and that question's answerhas to be given by everyone.So, this is our way of figuring outthat how can we know our teambetter beyond work in the absenceof us meeting physically.So, we would ask questions like,what's one embarrassing thingor embarrassing experiencethat you had with your parents.Lately, we asked, let's sayif you did not ever have to earn moneyand you had all the money in the world,then what would you be doing in life?So, things that you would generallyask your colleagues if you were in an office,but since we are not in an office environment,this is something that we try and replicate.Usually, my day ends after this,but we have kicked off onevery interesting projectcalled Project W. I will not shareits details with you right now,but there was a catch-up on it at 8 pmwhich ended at about 8:30 pm.In here, the slot that you seebetween 6-6:30 pm, this iswhen I have my dinner.So, I have my dinner between 6-7 pm.If I have any meeting later on,then it's between 6-6:30 pm,otherwise 6:30-7 pm.And if I'm free after that,I go out with the kids and Ruchito the park, spend some time there,come back by 8-8:30, freshen upand get into our nightdress.Lights are off in our house at 9 pm,kids sleep by then.Ruchi and I catch up from 9-9:30about how the day was,and then at 9:30 pm, we are done.So, by 9:30, I'm almost always donewith the day because I have towake up at 4:30-5 the next day,and I need those 7-8 hours formyself because that isthe most precious.Let's move on to Tuesday,Shaurya is a team member,he is the data guy for the YouTube team.We have a one-on-one withevery team member once a month,so this was the one-on-onewhich happened with Shaurya at 10 am.I send them a link and theyset it up, and then theyhave to find their own time.You will see there are thoseone-on-ones for the whole week.And then at 11 o'clock,I had a one-on-one with Neeru.Neeru is my music teacherand we meet once a month foran hour where we just discuss life,anything in general.I really like spending my timewith her, she also likes todo the same thing.So we just catch up outside ofour music to just figure outwhat are we doing in lifeand if there is anything that we can learn.And then comes the most importantpart of the week.On Tuesdays, from 2 to 5 pm,is when I shoot all thesevideos which you are watching.So today is also a Tuesday,it is not the 19th but it is the...So today is also Tuesday,it is not the 19th but the 26th,but every Tuesday from 2 to 5 pmI shoot all my videos for the week.So, 3 YouTube videos, which willbe posted in the week,7 Instagram reels, which willbe posted every day,one podcast for that week,and anything else that I mayhave to shoot.All of that gets done in that3-hour slot which is sacrosancton every Tuesday wherever I may be.I may be traveling, I may be outside,this will happen!And that's why it is blockedin such a way.Now let's move to Wednesday.On Wednesday at 10-11 am,this is an invite froma different calendar, but thiswas basically a meeting witha very interesting individual.In fact, it is a very interesting story.I made a video on MS Excel becauseI love MS Excel, and then someonefrom Microsoft actually wrote infrom the MS Excel team saying that,'I really liked the videoand I feel that we can work togetheron something meaningful,and strategic, and long-term.'Isn't that amazing?!I am blown away by how much lifehas to offer if you do yourwork clinically, and don't keepquestioning about where will I reach,what will happen?You just do what you loveand then things keep opening for youin a way that you could not have imagined.So this was that meeting.Then on Wednesday, I write a newsletterfrom 10:30-11:30 for the week,which goes out every Fridayand it's called Warikoo Wanderings.So I write that Newsletter inthat one hour on every Wednesday.I pushed it a little on this daybecause I had a meeting earlier,but that flexibility remainsbecause as you will see,there are a lot of open slots.From 10:30-12:30, the panel discussionby Western Union happened,about which we had a meeting on Monday.Then free time, free time.Lunch from 1-2.Afternoon nap from 2-3:30,so on and so forth.At 4 o'clock, this was a coursethat I was conducting forShree Cement for all the managersof Shree Cement on feedback.So it was the closing session.This was a live course whichwe were doing, so that happenedfrom 4-5.On every Tuesday, I ask a questionon Instagram, so it's basically like,Ask me anything on moneyAsk me anything on friendshipAsk me anything on somethingAnd on Wednesday from 5-6 pm,I randomly select some of thosequestions and answer them.So 1 hour is dedicated to this.After this, I had a one-on-onewith this girl named Shloka.She had reached out on Twitter,it was a random ask from her,I also agreed.We postponed this twicebut we were able to make itand I had a really nice timespeaking to her.And then at 7 o'clock,I had a call with Rakesh.He is my financial advisor,who manages my money froma company perspective,we just had a very brief catch-up.But by this time I was in the parkafter having my dinner,I was just having that callrandomly for 5-10 minutes,and that happened.On Thursday, it was a very very light day.Aditya, who is the YouTube editor,the one behind all the kick-assediting that you see on theYouTube videos,I had a one-on-one with him.And then after that, I had lunchwith a very dear friend named Chi Chi,I have to go to Gurgaon for this.This was one of the few rare in-personevents that I am doing right now,and after that, you will seethat the day was free.How did I spend it?Browsing, reading, writing, thinking!That's the beauty ofhow I love taking charge of my time.Fridays, 10:30-11 is whenI write my Twitter thread.I write a thread on Twitterevery Friday and that is somethingthat I write in this period.It typically takes abouthalf an hour to write.I have the topic or the ideain my mind already, but to write itin a structured manner quickly.Then at 3:00 pm, I had another sessionwith the same company for whichI am doing digital consultancy.Then at 4:00 pm, I meet upwith Insane Marketeers.Insane Marketers is the agencythat manages all the ads thatyou see on Facebook, Instagram,YouTube, so I have a weekly catch-upwith them from 4-4:30 every Friday.We look at all the numbers,measure them.How much did we spend andhow much ROI did it generate?What happened on Google, on Facebook,so on and so forth?Absolutely love the team!And then the Instagram Livespeaking session with Frederickfrom Oriflame at 5 o'clock on Friday.And then our YouTube team meetsat 7:00 p.m. every Friday.We again look at the YouTube dataabout what worked and what didn't.Which videos had a good reactionor did not?So on and so forth.And after that, we are workingon another project, we are buildinga course and you will getthe details soon enough.So we had a catch-up for that,which we have every week,again at 7:30, right after the YouTube call.I do Instagram Live every Friday at 10 pm,which most of you may have seen,if you haven't then I invite youto come to that Instagram Live.It's a great atmosphere!We just have pure fun for an hourwithout any agenda, no serious talk,just inviting people randomlyto speak to me.On Saturdays, from 11-12:30,I have my music class with Neeru,so that's what happened.Usually, I keep my Saturdaysand Sundays free but this wasa slightly heavy weekendand I will tell you why that was.Then at 2:30, there was anopening address where I wasspeaking with Anirudh, who is thefounder and CEO of Pepper Content.Pepper Content is a kick-asscontent company and they havea marketing summit by the name of Elevate,so I was giving a talk in itsopening session, actually havinga conversation with Anirudh.And then we had a Diwali partyon Saturday night at a housewhich is a card party.We had called our close friends for that.It was the festival of Karva Chauthon Sunday but that was not somethingwhich I was interested in,but I just read that here.There is a start-up called Crejo,they build really good educationalcontent for kids, so I was talkingto 13 to 14-year-old kids about finance,so that was a workshop that happened.Then at 12:15 pm, I had a catch-upwith the Instagram team of Waricrew,because we are planning a few thingsas we are getting closeto hitting a million.So this was my calendar.You will see there is a lotpacked in it, but besides that,there was also a lot of free time,that's what I love.So I could do a lot of things but still,I managed to have a lot of time for myself,which I could spend with myself,with my family, and so on.Let's have a quick view on this week.Monday was a light dayin the beginning but afterthat it got intense.I had a catch-up with astart-up founder, who does somecommendable work, so I was justcatching up with him abouthow are things.There was an event of BNY Mellon,about which we had a briefing callin the previous week.It was called Ideaclave.Then Nishtha, who is the content leadand the one who manages allthe content that happens in the team,I had a one-on-one with her.Then I had a catch-up witha friend of mine called Bijayover Zoom.And then we had the weekly7 o'clock WBR or theWeekly Business Review.Tuesday, which is today,started in a hectic way.I had a call with INDmoney ona new product that they have launched,which I was very excited about.Supriya who creates all the thumbnailsand the notes, which you reallylike on YouTube, I had aone-on-one with her.Then there was a follow-up callwith a CXO of a unicorn withwhom I did a digital workshop.Then Vaishnavi, who managesthe Instagram team,I had a one-on-one with her.And right now I am in themiddle of the shoot, and you willsee we are actually in themiddle of that shoot makingthis entire video happen.After this, I have a sessionwith Graphy from 6-7:30,for all the people it has selectedfor its first content creatoraccelerator program,so I am very excited about that.And then you will see thatthe rest of the day or therest of the week ratheris slightly busy.Why?Because very soon from the17th of November, I am likelyto go for a Vipassana 10-day retreat.So, I will not have any phone,any internet access,I will not be connected for 10 days,so I have to do all the planningfor those 10 days, regarding allthe YouTube videos that need to be posted,the newsletters, podcasts,all the tweets that I have to write,all the Twitter threads,I have to pre-plan for all of that,and that's why I am packinga lot of things in just a few weeksand a few days.Generally, my usual weeks aremore or less like the last week.Net-net, this is the conclusion.Time is something, which if youdo not control it, then it takesover you in such a way that yourlife will go away in a blink of an eyeand you will not even realize it.And the only thing that you willbe left with is regret.If you do not know how to controlyour time, then you cannot controlanything else.You will not be able to controlyour emotions, your money,your relationships because you don'teven know how to take charge ofthe most valuable asset that you have.However rich you may be, you maymake as much money as possible,but you can never buy back thetime that has passed.And how much ever you may try,you cannot predict the timethat will come.The only thing that you haveis right now.The present!The present moment!If you don't do what you needto do right now, then whileyou surely can't change your past,you will not be able to even planyour future properly.And what I do which I love doing is,live in the moment.I do everything because of whichI am happy right now,and I am able to do thingsbecause of which my futurewill also be hopefully happy.And my way of sharing my calendaris not so much about showingthat I do so many things in a day,it is just to show thatdespite doing so many things,I have time for myself becausethat's what I value the most.If you cannot take out timefor yourself, then whateveris it that you are spendingyour time on, is useless.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
