In today's episode, we have Tech Burnerwith us who is known by the name ofShlok in real life.How are you Shlok?I am good and super excited to talk to youfor the first time.I know, we are talking for the first time.I am excited too, man!Tell us.Actually, I think your vibe isvery positive, calming, and quite sorted,and it piques my interestbecause not just as a content creator,but your style is very entrepreneurial.The way you structure things,the way you create content, and all that,so I am very inspired by it,learned a lot of things, so yes,I am definitely very excited.Thank you so much man!Excitement is mutual!And as I was saying, I love your content,though I am not so much into tech,I don't buy a lot of gadgets,but I love the way how you giveyour content humor, drama,and package it in a way thatit becomes interesting,there are some videos whichI should not watch but I still watch them,because I think it's really outstanding,and I have a great happy time.So Shlok, the format of this conversationis 20 questions.Basically, I will ask you 20 questions,by the way, these questions areby the public.I post on my YouTube that I am meetingTech Burner or whoever is my guest,so what would you would like to ask them,and then I compile them,so I have a list of 25 questions.You can choose not to answer any questionat any point in time, but you can say noto only 5 questions.You have to answer 20 questions,and it's not a rapid-fire,so you can take your time, think about it,we will discuss it,but that's how we will go ahead.Ok, all set?Let's start with Kaun Banega Crorepati!Come on, let's start!Alright.If someone who doesn't know anythingabout you in a party asks youwhat do you do,then what will be your answerin one single sentence?I just say that I make videos,because that just takes care of it all.If I try and explain to them the businesswe do in the content creation space,it becomes very complex.So all I say is that I make videos.Check out on YouTube through Google.So I try to keep it very simple.But it also depends.Let's say, I am meeting an entrepreneur,then my answer would bea little different, then I tell themhow we set up the content,how we are trying to scale it,and what are the problems in the content.If I meet a content creator,usually they know more.But if I meet a normal person,let's say I am going in a caband somebody asks me that what do you do?Then I keep it very simple and say thatI make videos on YouTube.This question is quite complex.True that!It sounds simple!Nowadays making videos on YouTubeis still acceptable, but when I started,it wasn't like that.I'm 100% sure, you can relate to it.So when I used to say that I make videoson YouTube, people used to judge me,so I used to make itvery complex like I am inthe social media content creation space,and then nobody questioned me.So my main objective is that the person...Should not ask a question.Yes, don't ask any questions,just end it there.I love that!Ok, second question.What is your business's currentmonthly revenue?Right now, it is a little tough for us toview everything together because there aremultiple private limited companiesfor every project,plus I don't keep much of an eyeon the finance sheets.I rely very instinctively on the decisionsthat I take.But I think it would be in crores,think it must be multiple crores.At what point do you actuallysee that number,once a year, once a quarter, when?When it's time to pay the taxes.It's not like that, I do see them as inI am very aware ofhow the money is being spent,but I don't see how much moneyis coming in.So I am very cautious of the expenses,where they are going, and how much,but I do not see what's coming in.According to me, if I am cautiousabout the expenses,then the money will keep coming in,that's what I have seen.I am very cautious of where we spendso I get those messages, and I am alwaysaware of how much we are spending on what.I have never kept a watch onwhat we are earning, I mean very less,maybe once every three monthsor something like that.Awesome! Perfect!When you earn money for the first timein your life, what did you do withthat money Shlok?Do you remember?Yes, I do.The first time I made money was whenI created a logo and a posterand got â¹300,and I bought a Subway.Was Subway an aspiration,something that you wanted to do in life?No, I did not think much.Subway was a good investment.It was a good investment towardsmy health.I love that!Ok, question number 4.Who is your favorite YouTuber?I am my favorite YouTuber.I think we're doing somenext-level things,but I think besides me,if I were to pick one person.It is quite difficult for me to pick one.If you would ask me, my favorite singer,I can answer that,Kanye West is my favorite singer.But when it comes to YouTubers,since I have seen the back sideof the content creation space,so you know the pros and consand the negatives and positives of people,so when you see them in person,you've met them, and you've seenwhat is their shortcoming,then I can't pick one personbecause I know that even that personhas some negatives.So what I try to pick and choose isthat every person has their own journey,so I try to draw things out from them.I'll tell you the reason behind it.Since my childhood,I have idolized people,and I wanted to be a cool kidin my school,one of my friends was a cool kidand he was great at football,he was great at most things,and I considered him my idol,I used to ask him how to become cool,I wanted to be like him.Similarly, there was a personin my college and I wanted to be like him.I used to follow footballers.There was a footballer called Balotelli,those who follow footballmay know about him,so there were multiple peoplewho I used to follow passionately,and I have seen them all fail,and it hurts!Also when you pass your idols,then you realize they are not perfect,but when you watch them from a distance,it seems very gloomy,everything seems to be positive,but when you go close, you realizethat they also had flaws,and because of those flaws,they were not able to make it.And because I've seen that,I idolize very few people,and I take positive things from people.So in India,I really like Bhuvan's journey,how he started with his contentand took it to the film production space,and now he is creating shows and all.Sir, I really like your journey.I am being very honest because ofhow you've brought a entrepreneurial side,and the way you produce content,it is very different and very refreshing.I like a lot of comedians, Tanmay Bhat,Rahul Subramaniam,I like Ashish Chanchlani,I like their content.But yes, I watch very less content,but I am very inspired by their journey,because when you watch itlike a content creator,what I see is how it was created,so I can see the machinery workingat the back like a factory.But when a normal viewer watches it,they see a finished product.Correct! That's so true!That's very well put, man!Ok, question number 5.What do you think which isthe best Tech gadgets of all time?Something which is unbelievable,when you used to that product,it blew your mind.I think my personal favoritewhich may not be so powerful right now,but it'll be mind-boggling in the future,and I think like that becauseI have experienced it,but a lot of peoplehave not experienced it,it is AR Headsets.If you use it correctly,then it is another form of reality.Like if you are normally watching movies,it's good, it's great!But when you watch it through a headset,it is like you have entered another world.Now when I go to conferences,I went to MWC, Mobile World Congress,which is a tech eventthat happens once a year,another is CES where alsotechnology is showcased,they had these gloves that you can wearand then you wear a headset,so when you hold somethingwith those gloves, you feel resistance,just like if I hold this water bottle,I can feel some resistance thatI am holding something and my handcannot go any further,similarly those gloves had resistance,and when I used to hold something,I could feel it.And after using it for 5-10 minutes,it all seemed real to me.Suppose if I am on a roller coaster,and I am held the grill in front of me,and everything was vibrating,then my stomach started hurting.And as I look down from the hill,my body actually starts releasinganxiety hormones and sweating starts.So that's one thing that seems likesomething between reality and this.It's still not polished,the headsets are too big.But I think it would changethe way we see and consume things.Correct! I so agree with that!Awesome!Sixth, what time do you wake upin the morning?It varies a lot!These days I wake up ataround 8 in the morning,but I get off bed by 8:30,it takes me half an hour to get upfrom bed,I don't know why, I keep turning around,I like it that way,and I start with being lazy.And then I work out,I am doing very light work out these days,so I do 200 push-ups,then I do jumping jacks.Then I take a bath and go to my studio.But I am thinking of adding things to itlike meditationand doing an intense workout,so that will change.And I think 2 months back,I used to wake up at 6 in the morning,so sometimes I wake up earlyin the morning too,but if there is nothing to do,I go back to sleep.I love it!Shlok, these days where is most ofyour personal money invested,not the company's money?My personal money is invested in 2 places.I would say majorly in real estate,but that also not a lot,maybe just 10% is in real estate,and it's quite a bit of money.But there is one thing with me,I have a rule for my personal investment,I invest only where I have 100% knowledge.Great!So if I know where the money is goingthen only I invest.So I would say, majorly my moneyis invested in this brand only.So I had to invest in real estate becauseI was going to buy an office.Ok.So I thought it would be great if we buyan office to work in, but I realizedthat a better investment,since office for use and officefor investment are different,so we invested in a place,I bought a commercial office space,it was rented out to a big company,so the rent that I am getting from thatis being used to offsetour current office space,so it was a logical decision.Plus I bought a house,I actually bought it to make it a studio,but then we realized thatwe won't be able to live there,then I shifted there.So these are the two investmentsin real estate.But my major major investment isin clothing companies that we are making,we are making skins,we are about to launch overlays,this one will be launched on the 1st,we have invested a lot in this.I have bought many big next-level machinesin the factory, we are setting upthe whole production,a lot of money is invested in this.I invest a lot of money in establishingthe content and everything.So the major investment is in business.I have absolute trust in myselfand the work we do,so I am ready to investall the money there.I love it!And this should be the right approach.I love this!So good, man!I also did this in my life,and it has yielded far greater returnsthan anything else thatI would have invested in.Great! Wonderful!So the next question.One thing that I have noticedin all your videos Shlok is thatyou are always high on energy.Like even if you are talking aboutsome random things,you put so much of energyand emotions in it,that it almost feels as ifyou are living it.For example, I guess you recently posteda video,5 worst phones or unique phones.There is some hamburger phoneor something, and you rant into itlike nobody's businessas if that whole video is your universe.Where do you get this energy from?I am slightly introverted,but when I am making the video,I am very energetic,and it has also become a habitto be in exaggeration modewhile making a video.But I think that energy is becauseit has been consciously curated,it is not automatic,so I think when you are only around peoplewho are very positive,when you are taking care of your body,and there are very few negative thingsin my life,there are no negative people in my life,I do not consume negativity in my life,I don't read any random articles,I watch very less news,I consume very very positive content,I stay with very positive people,even the things that I do arevery uplifting,and I don't even do a lot of thingslike I don't do backbiting,I don't feel like speaking ill of anybody,all of that,so I think when you are living in a spacewhere everything is aboutgrowth and positivity,and everything is around progression,then I think that energy is radiated.And of course, I take care of my bodyand my mind, so I try to eat healthy,I try to do some light exercises,and to keep myself fit.So I think with a combinationof all these things,the energy around you is pleasing.I think that is what makes things work,but yes, I think this is the reason,but there could be some other reason.This is it, man!It could be something else,but I should acknowledge this.At your age, are you 27 years old?I am almost 27,my birthday is approaching.Sorry!So Shlok, to have this realizationat this age that you have right now,that there is very less negativityin my life,and I consciously stay awayfrom negativity,you have no idea, my friend,how far this will take you in life.It is unbelievable that at your age,you have this clarity.So I am so excited for you my friend!I don't think you even realizehow big of a gift you have becauseyou have this awareness right now.This answer made my day!I love it!Alright, next question.How much did you score in 12th?I don't remember,but I think my GPA was 9,there used to be something like GPA.That was it 10th, my friend.What's it in the 10th?I think it was around 85-90,I don't remember.Somewhere around!But I was a good student,I mean I was a curious student.I was super interested in Science and all.I really worked hard for IIT,but I couldn't clear it.But yes, I wanted to be a scientistor engineer or something.If you would have been in IIT,you would have taken a job asa product manager or a software engineerin a tech company,and you would see some Tech Burner,and say,What a life, man!What fun he must be having reviewingthese tech gadgets,and here I am all stuck in code!But at that time, I am sure it felt like,were you heartbrokenwhen you did not clear IIT?Very heartbroken.I can imagine.I used to hate IITs for a long period,I mean till I was in college.But now I realize that it takesa lot of hard work to get into IIT,and I really respect the people there,and they are amazing people,and I really want to talk to themand work with them,and I have met a lot of them.But yes, I realized that it was,now I don't know, I am lucky, I am giftedthat I didn't get through,because this is the paththat I went through,but I realized that I did not work hard,and my hard work was not good enough,it needs to be 5-6 times more.Love it, man, love it!Next question, are you single?I am in a relationship,and it's been 3 years.I try to keep it privatebut it doesn't stay private.You can keep it private in this video.All I needed was justa relationship status and that's enough.Perfect!Go on.Actually my girlfriend...How did it leak?I'll tell you that story.What happened was I thought thatwe will keep it private,I don't want to make too much noise.I guess she had a private account withabout 110 followers, so she shareda few stories and a post with our photo.So I was like,Who will see it and what differencewill 100 people make?As it is, it is a private account,and there were her friends only majorly.Some guy compiled 3-4 photosand made a YouTube Shorts sayingTech Burner's girlfriend.After 6-7 days,I saw that it has 5 million views,so I thought we should remove it,this would not be right,so I tried to talk her into removing it.Once we removed it, somebody reuploaded itand it got 11 million views.Then I was like,Now it's public, so I told her tomake her account also public.So yeah, it is interesting,and it is a part of life.Actually, the reason I want tokeep it private is,even from my parents and sister,because I have chosen this life,and it has a lot of negatives as well.When you become famous, people know you,and if you are traveling in a metroor something, there can be problems.So I am ready for those problems,it's my choice, but they don't know,they might not be ready for it,that's why I try to keep it private,but what's done is done,we'll see how things go.Wonderful! Perfect!Next question.Are you a workaholic?Do you work really hard?Yes.I don't know what's a workaholic.I am an obsessive type of person,so if I do something,I just keep doing it,and I can't think of anything else.I am in the content space right now,and I am running these businesses,so I just keep doing it,and I don't understand anything else.Even my personal life,buying clothes for myself,getting my shoes cleaned up,everything gets ignored,all I can see is content and business.So I am like that.I don't know if this happenswith everybody or not,but I used to think that it isa negative in majority.People around me used to tell methat it is unhealthy,this obsession is not right,I should take a break and go on vacations,and give a break to my mind and all.But I realized that I embrace itso I feel very happy working all the time,and I try to keep myselfphysically and mentally healthy,but I chose this, and I am grateful thatI am able to work so hard all the time,because a lot of people don't get anythingeven after the work so hard,so I don't want to let it go,so yes, I am ready to do everything.Love that, man!Next question.You have already answered this questionbut I would love to know more.Do you identify yourself asan introvert or an extrovert?As you said, at least in general,you have an introverted personality,but tell us more.Can I ask you the last question too?Yes, of course.I would like to ask the last question.Are you a workaholic now?I think about my work a lotbut I don't work a lot,and there is a certain nuance in it.Shlok, as you said earlier that I treatcontent also with an entrepreneurial view,that is actually true.I have a great team,I do everything in a process,I don't micromanage,I am not interested in gettinginto details because I value people,I trust people,and my work is set,and I think a lot about work,and I have to translate that thoughtinto a process, a system, and a role.So my objective is that my thoughtshould not become a bottleneckfor the company,because if I am the only onewho's thinking,then the company will be down the drainthe day I stop thinkingor if something happens to me.So I have to translate my thoughtinto a process, a system, and a role.And when everything is translated intoa process, a system, and a role,then gradually it will start scaling up,and it would not need me as much asit was required in the past.So in my any entrepreneurial stage,whether a startup,whether Groupon on nearbuy earlier,and now this content role,in the beginning,there is a lot of hard work,it's crazy because I have to learneach and everything,and translate into a process and a system,but as it goes on, my involvement reduces.So to give you a sense,in my content journey today,where we are present on everysocial media platform,and creating content everywhere,so on and so forth,I work only for 10 hoursin the whole week.That's it!Everything else is done through a process,a role, and a system.For my courses business which drivesalmost 50%, I work for 10 hours a month,because I really slogged and workedefficiently while making the course,but once it was completed,then it becomes leverage, process,system, role, and then it takes on,and then people start doing their work.So I like working a lot,I really like working,but I don't work a lot,I don't need to work a lot.When did you realizethat you should not be working yourself,and you should convert it intoa process or a role,and how did you learn it,there could be new things that both of usmay not be aware of,so how would you learn all of that?I ask what is requiredto go to the next level,because mostly my realization is thateven at the highest level Shlok,it could be anything,take it as Elon Musk who works like crazyand takes care of huge companies,their problems are not differentfrom our problems,the scale of the problems are different,and that means there is somethingthat they know at that scalewhich we still don't know becausethe scale is less.So I am always curious about the scale.I usually think, like I have been a CEOand the largest team size thatI have managed is 1,200 people,so I have run a company of 1,200 people,and it messes your mind becauseeveryone has their different expectation,a different approach,a different worldview,so there are discussionsand democracy and all.And then I ask myself,how does the government run this country?Because no matter what you do,there will be crores of peopleaccusing them of being wrong,not just thousands or lakhsbut crores of people,then how do you actually stillmake it work?I'm very fascinated by the question thathow does it work?And then you begin to see thatthe whole system is orchestrated,our whole political setup is orchestrated,from the smallest region rightto the central governmenthas minute details,everyone has a defined role,and how well that role is doneis a different matter,but the role is defined,and somebody thinks about crores of peoplewhich helps it function,so that is the only thing thatI center myself on.And my favorite approach in lifeis the problem you are stuck inis not unique.There are millions of peoplewho have faced this problem and solved it,so your objective is not to solvethis problem uniquely, my friend,your objective is to solve this problemthrough the learned experience ofmillions of peoplewho have already solved it,because what wonder will you do thatno one else has thought of?And that approach really works.So I am a product of otherpeople's experiences,that is what I chase.Very insightful!Very useful for me!I'm glad it was.Awesome!Next question.Shlok, what has been the hardest momentof your life till now?My hardest decision was whenI just completed college,and I decided I would not take up a job,I would continue with YouTube,and I did not have as many subscribersat that point to get me good money,so I went to college in Chennai,so all my friends had got good jobs,so just like the dialogue in '3 Idiots',You are not as sad when you failas when your friend passes.So I think the same thing happenedwith me.I was feeling left out,and I went back homeand I had no idea what to do and how,because my father had spent a lot of moneyto send me to Chennaiand I saw that all my relativesused to say things to my parents,Why did you send it to Chennai?You should have sent him toa nearby college.I used to feel pressured by whatthe people around me used to say,and at that time, I did not knowif I'm taking the right decision or not,maybe I should have taken a job,so that was a hard time,I cried for 2-3 weeks,and I used to be sad in the evenings.But after that I thought that since nowI have taken a decision, so better do it.And I figured out how to do everything,and I think that was very important.I am happy that I took that decisionbecause it was a very hard decision,I had no friends after that in Delhi,there was nobody around me,and I could not talk to my familyand relatives, so it felt very lonely,but that decision gave me the strengthand now I can take any hard decision.I have a reference point thatwhat will happen at most,I will be criticized a little like we saidthat you will not be able to succeed,all this is useless, but it is okay.I think that the courage to takethe decision was very important for me,and once you take a decision,things work out,that's what I genuinely feel.If you take a decisionand you put everything into it,things work out.Our minds are very smartand it figures out a way.Exactly!I love this, man!It's an amazing approach! Awesome!Based on this Shlok, the next questionis what is it that you realizedin your 20s that you now know was a lie?The world used to tell you thatthis is what happens in your 20s,and you realized thatthis was not the truth,or maybe not the truth for you.Everything is a lie!Everything is a lie!I realized so many things.I have spent my whole college lifebelieving it,and just after that, I realized thateverything is a lie!It does not make sense!All the edible items are chemical.Even our education system,I don't know if it works or not,because those who dropped outbecame big entrepreneurs.Just for a reference point,it might seem like bragging,let's say a normal salary,how much would you say isthe average salary in India?â¹50-60-70 K for an engineer.Let's say, an average salaryis around â¹5-6 lakhs.Yes, absolutely.And the car that I just bought,an average person would take 20 yearsto buy that car, and it's possiblethat I can buy 5 such cars which peoplemay take a lifetime to do,so it is, of course, a lie!You are advised to save money and thatwill make more money,and by the time you are 60,it will multiply to this, I don't know,it seems like a lie to me.Even a lot lot of social constructslike introverts and extroverts,I was told from childhood thatI am an introvert, and I agreed to itbecause everybody said so, so I was likemaybe I'm an introvert,but I went on stage once,somebody pushed meand I performed on stage,after that I started talking to peopleand I did not find it difficult at all,then I realized that maybeI haven't learned how to talk to people,maybe that's the problem.Even in business and all, people thinkit's all about luck,I think it's all about a choice.Most things are choices.Being rich is a choice.Being successful is a choice.Being healthy is a choice.Most things are choices, and people thinkthat it just automatically happens.So, everything seemed like a lieand after that, I feel that peopledon't realize that being successfulrequires a lot of sacrifices.You would know.Yeah.And most people don't have an idea thatwhat it takes.Especially if you want to becomesuccessful early,there are a lot of things thatyou have to give up for that,a lot of negative friends,a lot of relatives, a lot of thingsthat may seem comfortingbut you have to give them up.There are so many things, like everything,everything is almost a lie,like do what you love.According to me, don't do what you love.Be yourself!According to me, don't be yourself.Because those who do what they love,I have seen them all fail.And people who are themselvesI think they get carried awayin their ego, they don't make it big.So I have felt, like in physicsthere is a way of thinking,there is a way offirst principle thinking,where you take a very complex problem,like something which is taughtin engineering,it seems like a big problem,and you try to figure out the actual truthand the truth is very small.The truth is, F=ma.And then you realize that only this thingwill solve such a big problem!So, such actual truths are very few,there are small things that peopleprobably do not even know,those true things are hidden like this,they have to be found slowly one by one,and then you see the bigger picture,and then you realize that a lot of thingsin our culture are lies.So I think that is an exploratory process,and most of the successful peoplego through it, and they figure out,at least in their segmentthey realize the truth,and then they built their business on it.That has been my journey!Brilliant!The answer of the evening!I love it!Everything is a lie!Great!Sir, are you saying this to please me?Not at all, man!I am having so much fun thatI want it to go on for 2 hours,but it's not possible,so I will focus on the question itself.Shlok, how big is your team?The people who workin the studio right now,I think around 60-65 people,and if I combine all the factories,then maybe more than 100 people.Nice, wow!That is awesome!I love it!Proper setup!It's scary sometimes.Yes, I know,I can totally relate to that, man.It's scary!When people start getting bigger,there are many different challenges.When things are small,things happen rapidly.As things start getting bigger,especially when it comes to people,then emotions start coming in,opinions start coming in,and interpretation of communicationstarts coming in.You must be speaking something,someone must be understanding something,distances start coming,and the culture starts becoming different.You have a studio, you have a factory,you have so many other things,but you are just one,and you want to run it in the same way,but they will grow arounddifferent leaderships,with different experiences.And the hardest thing Shlok will be,you will actually be required tobecome different peoplefor the different setups that you have.You cannot be just Shlok,because you will have to make Shlok A,Shlok B, Shlok C, Shlok D,because if you don't do that,then you will be constantly in conflictwith what they want from youand expect from you.And again, the thing about scale.Imagine, say an Elon Muskwho enters Space X,he is telling people thatwe have to go to Mars,which is completely wild.But when he enters Tesla, he says thatwe have to make our vehiclesfaster and cheaper.Then he goes to The Boring Companyand says that with the technologyand the pace and cost with whichwe pierce the roads,we have to reduce it by one-sixtieth.Then he will go to Twitter today and saythat they have to remove all the botsfrom the entire platform,and make it a profitable, high-revenue,low-cost company.These cannot be the same people,and that is why most successful peopleare so 'awkward looking' which peoplealso called geeky or nerdyor socially awkward,because they don't even know which avatarto take up, and that's why celebritiesare so good at it because most actorsare trained in character building.So Shahrukh Khan takes 2 secondsto become Shahrukh Khanin front of an audience,in front of a movie,in front of Shlok,in front of Ranveer,in front of an award show,in front of an education institute,or anything else because that characteris his profession,and it comes so naturally to them.But it doesn't come naturally to usbecause we are not trained in that.So this will be the hardest challengeas you build this empire of yours whereyour personalities will have to coexist,and when you sleep at night,you will not knowwho you are making sleep,you are making Shlok A sleep,Shlok B sleep, Shlok C sleep, or whoever,and that will be the dissonance.So people who get comfortable with that,thrive.People who fail at that, get crashed.I'll add a small thing to this.I thought a lot for two-three months aboutwho I am in front of the camera,who I am in front of people,and how I feel very differentlyin different situations, so is it okay?Is this correct or not? Am I fake?So what helps me sleep at night,I don't know where I read it,I think Walt Disney said it,but I could be wrong,It does not matter how many charactersyou build as long as your valuesand the things you believe instay the same.So this quote helped me to remain sanebecause I realized thatwhen I talk to a childand when I talk to an aged person,it is very different, and I am essentiallyplaying a character in front of a child,and I am playing a different characterin front of an aged person.In the same way, when I am making a video,or doing a podcast,or going in front of people,or I am acting,and I am a different personalitywhen I go to the factory, so it helps mesleep at night, so that's one thingwith which I 100% agree thatwe have to build a lot of characters.Life is a play!Life is a play!This is an interesting question.I didn't notice, but the audienceasked this question.How are your eyebrows so perfect?Oh my God!And you know what,when I read this question, I was like,I am sure that now you are consciousbut do you do something?Look at it closely. Try to guess.It's very nice, man!I am the most beautiful personon this earth!I have been gifted with theseamazing features.Even my ears are so special,gifted by God.You have the Golden Ratio!But yes, eyebrows have been gifted.They have always been great,I have never touched them.Natural!I try to take care of my body,but some things are God-gifted,and I am very grateful.I love that!Ok, next.Who was your first clientand how did you get that first client?So my first client was,like my first business in school,a small business of designing,so the first client there wasa college club,I made posters and a logo for them.I got around â¹300 or â¹800,so that was my first client.And then gradually,I got some more clients,random businesses and small startups,and NGOs.But eventually, now the biggest clientis majorly the audience.We show our ads to the audience,everything works through the audience.So yes, the biggest client is the peoplewho are watching.Thank you, thank you so much!I love that!Yes, amazing!Alright, what's the most expensive gadgetthat Shlok owns?My car is expensive.How much is it?The car is for over â¹1 Cr.I think we've bought a printerwhich is very expensive.So these designs, these skins,layers.shop,launching on the 1st of November,so it's a unique printer to print them,it prints through UV rayswith separate layersand different printing styles,that's very expensiveI think it's for about â¹30 lakhs,and we have two such printers,one is for 30 and the other one is for 20.So I think you can say,they are the most expensive gadgets,because it is essentiallya piece of technology.Correct.They are the most expensive.And the second most expensive would be,we have a serverwhere we store all our data.It is 100 TB, and we connectmultiple computers to itand edit on each simultaneously.Like, 5-6 computers togetherget shared storage of 100 TB,and you can directly edit on all of them,you don't have to keep any fileson your computer.That was for around 10 lakhs.So these 2-3 things are quite expensive,but they are 100% worth it.Each investment made us so much money.I can totally imagine that!I love it!Alright, last question Shlok.What do you think will bethe most expensive thingyou will ever buy?One thing which I can guaranteethat I will buy is,there are a lot of other thingslike I will definitely be buying islands,I will definitely be buyinga lot of expensive real estate,but one thing which may seem materialisticbut it would be very functional would bea private jet,but I will buy these things only when,like right now Gulfstream 700ERis doing good,but right now we can't spend money,I will buy when it won't make a differenceto my business if I buy it,it won't matter if I buy it.How much is it right now?I think it is around â¹700 crores,it could be more, around â¹700-800 crores,but when it won't matter to meif I buy it,that is when I may buy it,and when it adds value meansI can recover the money.A lot of people may find it materialistic,but that's who I am!That's who I am, so what!By the way, you should know,I asked the same question to Tanmay,and he answered exactly the same,he also wants to buy a private jet.It's lots of fun, a private jet makeslife a lot easier, and it saves time.It saves time, it saves a lot of time,and at some point in time,time will become your biggest expense,so if you can save it, you must.What will you buy?According to me, my biggest expensewould be a trip to Mars.Interesting!That is 100% happening.I don't know when and how,but if Elon does his work right,then it could be slightly cheaper as well,but right now it seems to be expensive,but let's see.Nowhere close to the private jet,maximum â¹10-15 crores.I also want to spend the last yearsof my life on a different planet.Amazing!It will be fun!I love it!Wonderful, man!This was super fun!This is the longest that I have shot,and I didn't want to stop.Thank you so much Shlok!You are doing some amazing work.What I love is that you have used contentto diversify and build it,knowing that your audience wants it,so whatever you are doing,you are making it for the audience,you are using your contentas a great funnel to attractthe right kind of attention,and then you are selling them thingsthat they genuinely want and aspire for,so it's a brilliant way to make them happyand also make your business prosper.All the best with that!Keep going, don't stop.Sir, I also enjoyed, I also learneda lot of things from your journey,and how you do things,so it is very inspirational,and it acts as a reference pointthat you come froman experienced background,so I realize that this ishow we can think about it,and I would love to connect more often.I would love to do that as well.It was very exciting coming hereand talking to you.Thank you so much Shlok!All the best!Bye-bye!Awesome!
