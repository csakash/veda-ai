Alright, this is part 2,because that went beyond 30 minutes.Let's start.First of all,when you are buying this,then you are not justbuying Canslim, you buying thesubscription of Windmill Capital.What is Windmill Capital?It is one of the smallcase managers,and they have 52 smallcases.So, if you look at Windmill Capital,then you will see, some of them are free,like All Weather Investing,Dividend Aristocrats,Equity And Gold, by the way,all of them are very good smallcases,but the ones which do have this in front,they are all paid,like Speciality Chemicals,Value and Momentum,Value and Momentum is a reallygood smallcase,  there's Dividend Stars,there are many others,like Brand Value, Quality - Smart Beta,so on and so forth, you get accessto all of these smallcases throughjust one subscription.Whether it is â¹800 per month,â¹2,000 for 3 months,or â¹6,000 for a year.Now, what is the important piece?The important piece is thatâ¹6,000 is a lot of money,so you have to buy the subscriptiononly if you will invest at leastâ¹5 lakhs in a year, because ifyou would invest less than that,then these â¹6,000 would be a lotas a percentage of your total investment,and at least I would not recommend thisbecause that will be a veryhigh cost of investing whichyou shouldn't bear.Broadly, your cost of investingshould be between 1-2%,so if it takes 6,000 to be 1%that means â¹6 lakhs, if you take itas 2% then â¹3 lakhs,I mean if you are ready to investbetween â¹3-6 lakhs in a year,then you can take the subscriptionworth â¹6000 annually.If not, then please start withfree smallcases,there are enough and moregood quality free small cases,as I said, there isAll Weather Investing,Top 100 stocks, so on.When you buy this subscriptionworth â¹800 or â¹2,000 or â¹6,000,then you are not taking it onlyfor this small case, you are takingthe subscription of Windmill Capital.What is Windmill Capital?It is a smallcase manager,basically the ones who doall the research for you.So, there are 52 smallcases in Windmill,and it is a SEBI registeredresearch analyst creatingall these ideas, blah blah blah.So you will see it hasAll Weather Investing, 100 Stocks,Dividend Aristocrats, Equity And Gold,all of them are very good smallcases,all of them are free, free access.But then there are some likeCanslim, Speciality Chemicals,Value and Momentum which isa very good smallcase,Dividend Stars, Brand Value,Quality - Smart Beta,all of them are paid.So through this subscription,you take the subscription of allthese paid smallcases, not just one.But the important thing to noticeis that if your annual investingis not more than â¹5 lakhs,then it may not make sense for youto buy this â¹6,000 subscription.Why?Because the cost of investingwould increase.Your cost of investing should bebetween 1-2%.So if it takes â¹6,000 to be 1%that means â¹6 lakhs, if you take itas 2% then â¹3 lakhs,I mean if you are ready to investbetween â¹3-6 lakhs in a year,then that is a good reason for youto buy this smallcase subscription.But if your investment would be lessthan â¹5-6 lakhs annually,then you are unnecessarilyincreasing your cost of investingwhich is something I would not recommend.Why?There are a lot of freevery high-quality small cases.As I said, All Weather Investing,Equity And Gold,these are really good quality smallcases,which are brilliant for someonestarting up, and that is whatyou should tap into.Finally, 3 things that I wouldsummarise to bear in mind forsmallcase investing.Number 1, smallcase investingis a long-term investment.You would not be able tomake money overnight.This is made and built on ideasthat have a long duration returnattached to that,so please don't get greedyand don't treat it as trading,that you invest todayand if it goes down tomorrow,then you get frazzled,nothing doing.You have to be patientand invest for at leasta 5-10 year period,which is number one.Number 2, whenever you buyany portfolio of stocks from smallcase,then they are residing inyour Demat accountand your depository,not with smallcase.Like when we buy a mutual fund,whether it is from INDmoney,or Groww, or Coin, so on and so forth,then it is not with that platform,it is the mutual fund company.In the same way, smallcasesthat are bought are restingin your Demat account.You have 100% ownershipat all points of time.And number 3, before takingthis smallcase's subscriptionor any other smallcase's subscription,please check that your cost of investingshould not be more than 1-2%.So the more quantum you invest,the subscription amount shouldbe 1-2%, not more than that.If it is more than that,then my suggestion,start with the free smallcases,enjoy the power and benefit of it,that is the best use of it.It is an amazing product.If I spend â¹100 in theIndian stock market,then â¹30 go to direct stocksthat are my selected stocksin which I regularly invest,the remaining 70% is allon smallcases.Every month with absolute dedication,I blindly invest my moneyin the momentum strategy smallcasesthat I have bought.Super happy with the returns!Even on today's date,I am sitting on 50% plus returns.This return is for around 2.5 years.I am more than happy withthat because frankly,I have many more riskier assetsthat will give me high growth,but this is where I want to parkthe bulk of my money,because I know it is consistentand has good quality returns.Video has become slightly long,but I hope it was a useful one.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
