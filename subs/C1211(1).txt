How can you plan foryour early retirement,we'll get to know in this video.Friends,FIRE:Financially Independent Retired Early,is an acronym that is especiallyquite popular in this generation.If you haven't heard of it,I'm sure you want the samein your life in some or the other way,that you become financially independent,and thus are able to retire early.In this video, I will try to createthe step-by-step guide throughwhich you will have a playbook,a process, and a mechanismthrough which you can alsobecome financially independentand thus can retire early.Let's start with the definition ofwhat it means to retire early.Retire early doesn't meanthat you stop working,because I don't think anyone drawsfulfillment from not working.Working in any shape or form isa part of our nature.Yes, it's important that we enjoythat work and that is whyffinancial Independence is important.Because often, a lot of us are stuckin the sort of workwhich we may not want to do,we don't enjoy it,but we are forced to do it becausewe are not financially independent.That doesn't mean that we do nothave control or take responsibilityfor our daily expenses.What it means is, God forbid,if we come to a pointwhere we stop earning,then our future life is screwed,because we don't have a way ofour investments paying for themselves.So the real definition of retirementis that your investments have reachedsuch a stage, where the returnsgenerated by them,through that you can live your life.That is true financial independence!If you have the kind of moneywith whose return you can meetyour daily expenses,you can fulfill your needs and wants,then you are financially independentand thus you don't need to work for money.Despite that, whether you workfor money or not, that's your choice,and that is true retirement becausethen you can do anything thatyou always wanted to do.You always wanted to paint,you always want to travel,you always wanted to sing,you wanted to create content,you wanted to teach,you wanted to work in an NGO,whatever the case may be,where you may not get as much moneyas you would get in a proper job,but it gives you more joy,more fulfillment,is what you can pursue.Now, this cannot be achieved overnight.You will have to start very earlywith absolute dedication,and in case, you haven't done that,don't worry!Through this video, hopefully, throughall the calculations in an excel sheet,I will leave you with that processthat you can start.We will talk about three things.Firstly, the most important question,how much investment should I make,and for how long, so that my lifeis taken care of at the agethat I wish to retire?So, here we will assumethat you have a current age,I mean you do have a current age,we will assume that you havea planned retirement age,and we will try to find outhow much money do we have to investevery month to reach our goal,which means at the age of retirement,we will have so much money thatour returns will pay for everythingthat we want in life?And number 2, we will talk aboutwe have understood thatwe have to invest some amount of money,where should we invest,and what kind of assets can give usthe returns which are necessary for usto get to the endpoint?And number 3, do's and don'tsabout this approach.Because everything doesn't applyto everybody.I am creating the Excel sheet ata very broad level.Only you are aware of the contextof your life, so how do you get tothe finer details of this excel sheet?And hopefully get you to the answerthat you want.Let's get started and play with Excel!So the first question:How much money would you have to investfor how long, so that you can gainfinancial independence?Here are the assumptions that I have made.First of all, I have assumedthat you are 23 years old,and I have also assumed that you wantto retire at the age of 45.You can put in any number you want,and of course,the lesser the age you put in,the more investment you will have to make,and right now wemay not have reached that point.You can change these numbers,it's completely in your control.And now I will ask you some questions.First of all,can you make a lump sum investmenttoday itself or not?This lump sum investmentcould be anything.It could be money you got from family,from friends, money that you have savedall these years, money that you gotafter breaking your FD,whatever the case may be,this is a lump sum amount that you caninvest in one go and after this,I will not talk about this amount.And then a monthlySystematic Investment Plan,which means every monthwith absolute dedication,you will invest this money.Where will you invest it?I will give you that answer.But you will have to invest this money.I have assumed that at the age of 23,you are in a job whereyou can invest â¹7,500 per month.That number againis completely in your control.If you can invest lesser,then make it less, even â¹500-1,000.If you can invest more, that's great,make it more.Everything will then give you,how many years will you be able tosupport yourself from the retirement age?And then, with how much percentagecan you increase this amount every year?Now that is not always yourincrement percentage,because if you will increaseyour investment percentage according toyour increment percentage, then youare not getting close to retirement,since your increment will increasegradually by 8-10%,but if your needs and wants also growat the same rate,then you are essentially making it harderfor you to retire early.To retire early, you will have tomake some early sacrifices in your life,so that later on, for a really long time,you don't have to work,at least not for money.So I have assumed that you can increaseyour investment by 15% every year.This means, if in a month you are makingan investment of â¹10,000,and you do that for a year,then in the next year, you will investâ¹11,500 instead of â¹10,000, which would bea 15% increment on the â¹10,000.Got it?Simple!Then comes 'annual return generated.'I have assumed it to be 15%.This is broadly what equity marketswould give you, but I will giveyou an explicit explanation on ittowards the end of the video.We have assumed inflation to be 5%.Right now, it is 7%, so don't be scared.This is like a long-termdecade-wise analysis,so we can assume it to be broadly 5%.Who knows whether I am right or wrong,but we have to use an assumption.This is again an important questionthat I ask you.When you will retire, which isat the age of 45, or you want to retire,what do you think your monthly expenseswould be at that point in time?Now that is some sort of a guesstimate,but try to fine tune this guessas much as possible.What do you think your monthly expenseswould be for yourfood, water, electricity, etc?The good thing is, I am not asking you forthe amount according to that time,I am asking you for the amountas of today.So I am asking you that as of today,as of the value of money today,as of today's rate,what do you thinkyour monthly expense would be?So what all are the thingsthat you need to consider?Your family would have grown.Possibly, you would have got married,you now have kids, and maybe now yousupport your familyand your spouse's family as well.The expense on your childrenmay have increased,your own expense may have increased.You may want to travel.In the journey of 23-45 years,I am not asking you to become a saint,I want you to live life,I want you to go about and enjoy,so that would also need money.And, I have assumed it to be â¹2 lakhs,and I can tell you that â¹2 lakhs iswhat I spend on our family today,outside of my investments.So, my investments are separate,but my monthly expense is around â¹2 lakhs,excluding the home loan EMI, this is forfood, children's school fees, etc.And by what rate would it increase?Remove the inflation, you are assumingyour own increase.The idea is that at the age of 45,since you want to retire early,this should not grow crazy.It shouldn't be like,'After retirement,I will travel everywhere,US, Europe, Australia,and blow away all my money!'Since you have to make that money last,you have to ensure that it growsbut it doesn't grow in a crazy manner.So I assume that to be 3%,and this is outside of inflation.And then I have asked you,What do you think will beyour major expenses for whichyou would need a one-time lump sum amount?For example, I have assumed thatat the age of 45,you are 23 years old right now,so whenever you get married and have kids,whatever, at the age of 45,you would need â¹15 lakhs foryour kid's education.This amount is according to today's value.This is not according to that time.I have separately calculated the amountaccording to that time.So if you want â¹15 lakhs today,then at that point in time,which is when you are 45 years old,after 22 years,that amount would be â¹44 lakhs.Then I have also assumed thatat the age of 50,you would want to buy a house,so that would need a down payment,your EMI would bepaid from those â¹2 lakhs.So there would be a down payment,and I have assumed that it would beâ¹20 lakhs as of today.Let's assume you are buying a houseworth â¹1 crore, usually,the down payment is 20%,you will take a loan of â¹80 lakhs,and your down payment would be â¹20 lakhs.At that point in time,which is at the age of 50,these â¹20 lakhs would be around â¹75 lakhs.This is the total calculation.When we do this calculation,and we just zoom out for a bit,what you get iswhen you would be 45 years old,which is when you wish to retire,how much moneywould be there in your bank?This is driven by the investmentsyou have made,the rate at which the investmentshave grown,and the expensesthat you accounted for.If these expenses are before 45 years,then they will be deducted,and if they are later,then they are accounted for later.And if at this rate,which is 15% that we have assumedevery year,if these â¹4 crores keep growingat this rate, then this,alongside your monthly expenses,plus all your one time expenses,after accounting all of them,you can live till the age of 88 yearswithout the need to earn money.I will say that once more.If this calculation is absolutely right,in the sense that you are being honestto yourself.You started to invest â¹7,500 every monthat the age of 23,you did it till the age of 45,and after you are 45 years old,you spend â¹2 lakh per monthin today's value,plus you have also accounted forwhatever money you need tospend after that,which is a one-time lump sum,then these â¹4 crores which you will getat the age of 45,if they continue growing withthe same rate at which you haveinvested it earlier,you don't need to earn any money tillthe age of 88 years.This is how you play withyour retirement age.Let's play with this and see the numberthat we get.I will make it full screen for this,and we go here,and then we...Perfect, cool?!Let's say,'45 years is too late, I want to retireat the age of 40because everybody is retiringat the age of 40.Let's invest in crypto and all!'So let's say, you make it 40.The minute you make it 40, your moneyhas reduced from â¹4 crores to â¹1.5 crores.Your expenses remain the same, which meansthese â¹1.5 crores finish at the age of 47.So you will be able to you pay foryour kid's education at the age of 45,but you don't have the money to buyyour house at the age of 50,they will be over by the age of 47.So if you still want to retireat the age of 40,what will you have to do?You will have to increaseyour investment amount.Let's make it â¹18,000, and suddenlyyou get 81 years, and the amountis â¹3.5 crores.And if you want to broadly makethe age as 88,then this is how it will be.Now notice the impact.At the age of 23, if you startby investing â¹7,500,â¹7,500 per month only,then you can retire at the age of 45.If you want to retire at the age of 40,then you will have to investâ¹18,500 instead of â¹7,500 every month.And mind you, it is growing by 15%, ok!To give you a sense,this is how it will be.Let me blow it up.At the age of 23,you started with â¹18,500,but when you will be 40 years old,you would be investing â¹2 lakhsevery month,which is not a trivial amount.It may be sounding big right now,but if you adjust it with inflation,this amount will also be reasonably closeto what you will be, but still,investing â¹2 lakhs every monthat the age of 40 is still a lot of money.But if again, I make this 45,and this as â¹7,500,then you will see that at the age of 40,I would be investing only â¹80,000.That is the power!You start with â¹7,500,it will gradually keep growing,and you will have about â¹80,000.In fact, even at the age of 45,it will only be â¹1,60,000.It won't reach â¹2 lakhs.Even at the age of 45,when you would be retiring,you would only be investing â¹1,60,000as against the â¹2 lakhsthat you would have to investat the age of 40,if you want to retire early.That is how you will play around.And naturally, you can also say,'What if I reduce my expenses?I want to retire at 40, I can investâ¹7,500 only because that's whatI am capable of,but I can reduce the monthly expensesfrom â¹2 lakhs to â¹1 lakh,it won't make a lot of difference.'Look at this, 57.At the age of 47,you will be going till 57.So by reducing your expenses,you cannot try to gain it,because expenses will happenat some point in time.What you will have to do isto actually think abouthow you can increase the quantum.So now if I make it â¹10,000,then yes! 84, close to it!So if you want to retire at the age of 40,you will have to reduce your expensesafter the age of 40,only â¹1 lakh instead of â¹2 lakhs,and instead of â¹7,500,you would have to invest â¹10,000.This is how you play with it.And I would encourage you to playwith this as much as you can,because that's the beauty ofan excel sheet,that you get a sense of controlwith these numbers,and a sense of clarity as well.Now the second thing,Where do you invest your money?From where will these 15% be generated?You can get 15% only from equities.If you try to invest your money in FD,if you invest your money in EPF or PPF,if you invest your moneyin gold or real estate,the returns from all theseare between 6-10% only.Nothing comes close to beatingthe equity class when it comes to returns.Now this is my belief,and I could be completely wrong,only time will tell, that forthe next 10-20 years,India's equity market is goingto grow absolutely wonderfully.Since our companies will go global,our demand will keep increasinginternally,thus the profits of our companieswill increase, so whatever you will seeas part of the economic growthof this country, will result in the growthof stock market of the country as well.There is no doubt about this.The question is, to what extent?So my 15% is against somebody else's10 to 12%, whatever it is.If historical data is anything to go by,in the past 10 years, India's stock markethas given a 14% return,13.8 to be precise.Sorry, not 10, in 20 years it has givena return of 13.8%, to be precise,and you,at least I would expect that it willgo beyond this, and that's why 15%.Mind you,I have adjusted tax in this amount.So I have assumed that there isa 10% long term capital gain tax,what is applicable will apply,so you will get 90% of the amount,and 10% would go to the governmentbecause that's what we have to give themas part of the tax.Second, invest in the stock market.Now where to invest?You have three choices.Choice number 1: If you have time,you have done the research,and you have the capability,then you can pick selected stocks.I would not recommend thatif you do not have the time, research,and capability, because picking stocksis a really really hard thing to do.You have to manage them actively,and balance them actively.Balance means how much ofa particular stock should you buy or sell,should you buy or sell some other stock,so on and so forth.It becomes really hard!Option number 2:Go for a portfolio of stocks.A portfolio of stocks means investingin index mutual funds.What are index mutual funds?In our stock exchanges,Bombay Stock Exchangeor National Stock Exchange,people invest in their portfolio of stocksand by capable fund managers.These are the people who have the time,the research, and the capabilityto manage somebody else's money.Nifty 50 is a good index to invest in.It invests in the top 50 stocksof the National Stock Exchange.Nifty 200, Nifty 250,there are lot many like these,their risk profiles are different.Nifty 50 would be the least risky,still riskier than other assetslike FD, gold, EPF, PPF, etc.because it's volatile,the market will keep fluctuating,and that will keep happening,but for the long-term,it will show positive growth.So that is the second option.Third option:You should have a financial advisorbecause you would be investing so much,around â¹1-2 lakhs per month,so you can use the services of somebodywho will plan this out.All you have to tell them is,'I want my rate of return to bearound 15%.'That is something that you have to ensure.This only happens much later.You will not get a fund manager whenyou are be investing â¹7,500 per month,which will be a personalor investment advisor,but at some point when it growsto be â¹1 lakh or 50-60-70K,or â¹10 lakhs annually, you can getenough and good wealth managers,either from your bank,or any other advisory servicewhich can help you.That is where you have to manageand invest your money.And finally, do's and don'ts.The biggest one:Do not be in a hurry to retire early.If you see this excel sheet,retire early is very very very hard.There are a lot of people who wantto retire at the age of 30.You can, it is possible,but it is intensely hard.You will have to investa lot more money per month.You will have to take a lot more riskbecause a rate of returnwould also be required.For example, if I would try to show you.You are 23 years old,and you want to retire at the age of 30,everything else remains the same.You would have only â¹19 lakhsif you do this.But if you change it to â¹50,000 per month,then it will be 43 years.Let's say, we should have thismoney till our 80s.If you change it to â¹1 lakh,then it will be this.Let's say, â¹75,000, no, â¹85,000, yeah,â¹90,000, yes, so around 95.â¹93,000, right!So you would have to investaround â¹90,000 every month,starting at the age of 23, ending at 30,so that you have all the money,and once you are done at 30,you will have to manageyour monthly expenses in â¹1 lakh,by the way, which is very hard,not easy.But if you want to sign up for that,then that is a level of commitmentit will require.Now suddenly if you say,'I don't have â¹90,000,I can only invest â¹10,000.'Then this number, which isthe rate of return will have to become...Then this rate of returnwill have to become 101%.This means, your money shoulddouble up every year.It's impossible, my friend.It's impossible, come what may.Nobody's money doubles up every year.It can happen for one year.If you're lucky,it can happen for two years.It cannot happen for 7 years.And that means you will, unfortunately,fall into the trap of these chit funds,crypto fly by night,get rich quickly schemes,which are going to be disastrous.Please don't do it!It is wonderful, man!If at the age of 23, you comfortablyinvest your money,then you can retire at the age of 40,you have enough and more moneyto live your life later on,why hurry?That's number 1.Number 2, this is still an excel sheet.I have created this excel sheetso that you get a broader perspective.You will have to get intothe finer details of it.What is it that you actually thinkwill be your big expenses in the future?After your retirement age,what do you thinkwould be your monthly expenses?Do all of that research.Plan for that.It's fun, right?It's fun thinking about the things like,I may say,I grew up in Lajpat Nagar in Delhi,and I always had a desirethat whenever we would have a house,by the way, it was not fulfilled,but whenever we would have a house,we would live in GK, or Defence Colony,or in some posh colony of South Delhi,so you would imagine that the rent there,today I am giving rent of â¹10,000,but I would be payinga rent of â¹40-50K there.I will do this and that!Think of all of those things.Extrapolate your life out 10-15 years,and ask those questions becausethen you will get a far richer answer.This is a very broad-based excel sheetto the question,how can you retire early?It is your responsibilityto make it more specific,and I would love for you to do that.I hope this was useful.I hope through this sheet,you got a mechanism to decidehow can you plan for your retirement,and make sure that you never have to workfor money forcefully.Ankur warikoo, signing off!
