true value of life.It is a beautiful book about somebody,and I won't reveal much about the bookbecause it takes away the joy...A beautiful book around this personcalled Morrie with whom a personused to spend time every Tuesday,and what they learned in the process.Wonderful, wonderful book!The second book,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck.This book was not released in my 20s,but this book by Mark Manson isa very beautiful book to explainand express that if you reactto everything and life...This book by Mark Manson isa very important book to tell youthat if you react to everything in life,then your whole life will go awayonly by reacting,you will never be able to calmlyobserve and experience anything.The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ckmeans how every little thingis not important in life,and which are the thingswhich are really important,you will get to know through this book.The third book, The Alchemist.A beautiful book,a very successful bookI think around 75 million copiesof this book have been sold till now.This book by Paulo Coelho simplytells us, like that famous dialogueby Shahrukh Khan,'Try to get something so desperately,that every particle conspiresto join it with you.'Something like that,I am doing such a horrible job of it.Basically, the crux of the book is,for you to find what is trulythe most important thingis something that lies within you.And it's a wonderful story throughwhich this lesson is imparted to us.I believe everyone in their 20swill immensely enjoy and benefitfrom this learning.Number 4,How to Win Friends and Influence People.The best-selling book by Dale Carnegiewhich has been on top of the ranksfor many years.It is a very practical guide onhow is it that you can make friends?How is it that you can't influence people?And how importantare these skills in life,you realize it only after your 20sbecause that is when you will beginto get valued for how you dealwith people as against what you knowas a professional.Number 5, Quiet: The Power of Introverts.So many of us are introverts.So many of us do not like tosocialize with people.People drain them,suck out their energy,and they almost always feelthat to be successful,it is very important to be extroverted.This book by Susan Cain demystifiesthat entire piece.She says introverts have a power,which if they recognize,they can use it to their advantage.If you are an introvert,I would highly highly highlyrecommend this book becausethis will give you a glimpse ofwhat is the power within you.Number 6,"Wait, How Do I Write This Email?"I have created a lot of videosabout cold emails,you can check them out,and this book is basicallya summary of everythingthat I know about cold emails.What are cold emails?Email or message a personwho doesn't know youbut you know them,and you want something from them,maybe an internship,a recommendation, a favor,funding, a request for a meeting,help or guidance, or mentorship.And it is such a powerful skillto know because if you knowcold emailing,if you know how to write an emailto people who don't know youto get their attention,then imagine how powerfulthe entire world becomes.That is something that you willlearn through this book.Highly highly highly recommendedespecially for people in their 20s!Next, Linchpin by Seth Godin.It is a book that tells youhow to become indispensable at work,or even in life.Often when we do some work,if some other person is able to dothat work faster, better, and cheaper,then we can be replaced.But there is something in the waythat we approach our work, our life,that can make us indispensable,that can make us a linchpin.Linchpin is the most important partof a huge machinery,and if that is lost,or broken, or damaged,then the whole machine stops working.That's who you want to be.Not necessarily the biggestin that machine,but even the smallestbut the most important one.How?Through this book.Next, Start with Why by Simon Sinek.There is a lovely YouTube videoby Simon Sinek called,The Golden Circle.And I remember, I saw the video'The Golden Circle' in 2013-14,and it left such a huge impression on me.And after that, this book was released,Start with Why.This book tells us that if in our lifewe know our why,then the what and the howautomatically emerges.But all of us fixate ourselveson what and how.We try to tell ourselves,I want to be an engineer,a doctor, a YouTuber,a video editor, this and that,but we very rarely ask why?Why do you want to do it?And this book will force youto think that way.Start with your why,because then what needs to be doneand how it needs to be donebecomes obvious.Next, Mindset.Brilliant book!One of the most powerful booksthat I read when I was in my 20s.This book establishesthe concept of growth mindsetand fixed mindset.A lot of people live their lifewith the belief that theircapability is limitedto the way they were born.There is a limit to their capability,hard work, and intelligence,they can never go beyond it,and that's the fixed mindset.But some people live witha growth mindset.They know that they can do anythingif they set their mind to it.How does this mindset evenestablish itself?That is something thatthis book will teach you.All these books are availablefor you as a giveaway,absolutely free of cost,home-delivered to your address.How?Number 1, follow my channelbecause

read in your 20s,then it may not be applicable to you.All the other booksthat I am mentioning,though the video is'20 books to read in your 20s',but these could very well be booksthat you can read in your 30s, 40s,and in your teens as well.But The Defining Decade isa brilliant book for everybodyin their 20s.This book tries to establishthat in the decade of our 20s,we establish our mostmeaningful relationships,we take the most meaningfulprofessional decisions,we start to earn moneyand understand the way that it works,and how this decade is so critical,so important for all of us,and it lays down waysthrough which you can makethis decade the most powerful decadeof your life.Brilliant book! Highly recommended!Next, Freakonomics.A very funny and light book,which tries to explain the thingswe commonly see in the world.Through economics, this book tells uswhy the things that we commonly seein the world but don't understand,are the way they are.And it is such a great way for youto understand the machinery ofhow the world works.I remember, when I read this bookin my college days,it simplified so many things.I was a science student,I had no idea or understandingof economics,what is microeconomics or macroeconomics?This book simplifiedso many things for me,that I loved going back to itbecause I could always say,'Yes, I might be understandingwhy is this thing happeningin the world, in life,and I can explain it throughsomething which istheoretically proven.'Next,A Short History of Nearly Everything.If you want to knowthe world's history in just one book,right from its start to today,then this is a great book for you.We would like to read this bookin our 20s because within 4-5 hours,you will in one go capturealmost everything that thereis to know.And at least on the surface,you will get to know a lot of thingsabout the world.Highly recommended, great book,very nicely written as well!Next,Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.No matter what I say about this book,it won't be enough.It is a stunner of a book.A very simple yet powerful bookthat tries to explain to you thatwhatever we see in the world,what is the genesis of it?What is the genesis of religion?What is the genesis of agriculture?What is the genesis of human civilization?What is the genesis of money?And getting clarityover these things is so important,especially in your 20sbecause once you know all these things,you begin to understandwhy things happen the way they do.Absolutely incredible book!One of my favorite books of all time!I will be giving away a text version,but there is an illustratedcomic version as well,so if you like to read comicsand graphical novels,then I would highly recommend youto pick up that edition of Sapiensas against the text edition.Next, Rich Dad Poor Dad.I have often spoken about this book.I have reviewed this book as well.I think I read this bookat 18-19 years of age,this was my introduction to money.How to understand money?How to visualize money?Through the story of two fathers,one who continued workingfor their entire lifebut still couldn't become rich,another one who didn't workas hard but somehow wasalways in the money,this fact is established,how do rich people visualize moneyand how is that different frommost people that we know of?If you read this book early in life,I think it will help you immenselyin navigating through your money.Next, Thinking, Fast and Slow.This book might be academicallythe most difficult to readfrom the 20 books thatI am sharing with youbecause this says thatour mind is actually two minds,and these two minds work together.One mind which thinks very fastand another mind which thinksvery slowly.And how because of these two minds,we take right and wrong decisions.Brilliant book,but as I said hard book,so if you do not like itin the beginning, leave it,but come back to it.At some point in time,I assure you, this bookwill become the most important bookfor you in life.Next, Wings of Fire.APJ Abdul Kalam's autobiographywhich is an absolutely beautiful,very inspiring, and motivating story,I would love everybodyin their 20s to read it,because it will make you awareof our country's true valuesand cultural system.Somebody from such humble backgroundwent on to becomea leading scientist across the world,and then the president of this country.It's almost as if every opportunityis available for every human being.Brilliant book, highly recommended!Sticking with autobiographies,JRD Tata's autobiography,Beyond the Last Blue Mountain.One more phenomenal success storywhere that person was not evenfrom India but in some way theymade it their country...The success story ofa person who gaveso much to this country,including I would argue,the most loved and trusted brandof all times.A very enriching story,hard-hitting story,and it is not just for peoplewho want to go into their business,because there is so much thatJRD establishes as a business owner,I think the best thing aboutthis book is the way valueswere so integral in living life.If your life principles are right,then more or less, life willgo on the right path.Next, Atomic Habits.The best-selling book by James Clearwhich I feel every human beingshould definitely read oncein their life.A book that tells youhow the smallest of habitscan bring huge changes in your life.That's why Atomic Habits.Habits that make you work towardsa goal and a target without setting one.And then finally, Ikigai.The purpose of our life.Ikigai is a Japanese conceptthat when loosely translatedinto English means,'The purpose of me.'And that is what the book is about.There is a very interesting Islandin Japan where people livea happy and long life,and when people researched on them,they established that thereis something that sets them apartfrom most other people.This book is an introductionto the concept called Ikigai.As I said, you can read these booksnot just in your 20s,but also in your 30s, 40s,in your late teens,and you will eventually benefitfrom all that the book contains.I am ready to give all these booksas a
