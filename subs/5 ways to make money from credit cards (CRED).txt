5 ways to earn moneyfrom a credit card.Number 1:You can actually earn moneyby using a credit card.This means, use the credit cardas you do,but you will get free money from it.How does that even work?It is possible througha simple understanding ofthe principle of a credit card.In a way, the credit card companygives you an interest-free loanof 35 to 40 days.They say,make any expense at the beginningof the month through a credit card,you don't have to pay any money.Then at the end of the month,we will generate a billor a statement,we will give you around 2 weeksto pay it in full,which means we will not charge youanything for that amount for 30-40 days.We are earning from the merchant.So whenever you useyour credit cardwhich is accepted by the merchant,basically a retailer or whoever,they give 1-2% to the credit card companyfor the usage of that credit card,and that's how a credit card companymakes money.But if you pay the full amountof your monthly bill,100% of it after 30-45 days,then the credit card companywould not earn anything from you.So what does that do?It basically gives you a windowto make money from this.Suppose you do all your expenses,every little thing,a few things or not possiblelike rent or EMI,but all the other thingslike electricity bill,clothes bills, eating out bill,bill for books, cab bills,petrol bills, whatsoever,you do all the expenses througha credit card,but you have this moneybecause you have got that salary,then at the end of the month,you pay the full amount in one gothrough the credit card statement.But during that period,you invest that whole amountin a safe investment,not something like stocks.You have to ensure thatit is invested where your returnsare fixed,and the best thing for thatwill be a fixed deposit.Yes, I am suggesting a fixed deposit,but they absolutely beneficialfor this thing.So you will invest your full salarywhich will be equivalent toyour monthly expense in an FDfor 30-45 days.And the interest thatyou will earn in those 30-45 dayswill be the extra incomethat you will generateabsolutely free of cost.You don't have to do anything elsebesides this,and then at the end of the month,just liquidate this FD,and pay for your credit card statement,and make money.Now, this becomes excitingwhen you do it for a big amountand for a long time.Suppose you want to buy a phone.Let's buy iPhone 13 today.For this, we go to Amazon,this is not a sponsored post.Let's buy iPhone 13 today.Let's see how can we reducethe cost of the iPhone 13by â¹3,000 through iPhone 13,which is absolutely free money.So I will get startedand show you how it can be done.iPhone 13 of 512 GB is for â¹87,999,but it has a no-cost EMI option.If I click on this,then I will see that on Amazon,ICICI credit card,it's not sponsored post.Actually, since this isa sponsored post by Cred,so I don't want to name any other brand.So you can see a no-cost EMI option here.If I click on this,a credit card companyis giving you a no-interest EMIfor 6 months,which means you can paythese â¹88,000 in 6 equal installmentsof â¹14,667.Great!So, if I would have this credit card,I would definitely take this option.However, it is very important thatI should already have these â¹88,000,because that is the basis for youto make money.So if I would have it already,then look at how this entireprocess works.My total amount is â¹87,999,I have taken EMI of 6 months,so my EMI is around â¹14,667.If I see the rate of FD for 3 months,then I see many rates displayed.If I see the rate of FD for 6 months,then I can see multiple options,but we will go for a safe option.So we will go for HDFC which is 6.25.We won't try to go overboard.So if I go for 6.25, then for 6 months,if I invest these â¹88,000 in an FD,then I will earn â¹2,750 absolutely free.So this is one way for youto make money through credit cardsif you use them smartly.It is very important to havetwo things for this.Number 1:Before you make any purchase,you should already havethe full amount with you.So you are not making a purchasewhere you are actually taking a loan.No!And number 2:You will pay the full monthly billin one go.You'll never go for a minimum amount due.This is step number 1.Step number 2:Reward points.Whenever you use a credit card,as I said the merchantwho is the retailer has to pay 1-2%.Now whatever moneythe credit card companiesearn through this 1-2 %,it gives you some of it backin the form of reward points.These reward points can be used amazingly.You can use them for airline ticketsif you use a credit card froman airline.Or you can use it for cashbackbecause a lot of e-commerce storeshave their own credit cards,so you can earn cashback through that.You can convert them into gift vouchers,because many of them say thatyou will get a voucher of various brandsworth â¹500-1,000 on these many points.So essentially, for makingthe same purchase thatyou would anyways do,you are earning reward points,and that is a great wayfor you to save money,and thus make money.Based on this, step number 3:Apps like Cred beautifully pamper useven more.They say, the credit card companyis giving you reward points,but over and above that,I will also give you reward points.So, if you make a credit cardpayment through Cred,then you start earning reward points.As you can see on the screen,I have an unbelievable numberof Cred coins,because at a point in time,my credit card bill was huge,I was using it for a long time.I have been a Cred user from day one.Kunal is a good friend,so I am really proud ofwhat he has built.So I have gathereda lot of Cred coins.Now what happens because of thatis through this,I have opened a whole hostof reward points.You can use Cred coinsand play games, win jackpots.Many times, I participated in somethingand I got a cashback,I participated somewhere elseand got some other cash back.Plus ever since they have opened upshopping,it's opened up a whole new host of things,because number one,I find their products really interesting.They are very interestingand unique products,which I don't go about lookingor searching for,but if I find them, then it's like,Oh, I can buy this or this or that.So it encourages me to actually thinkabout new products, new brands,and look at new categories altogether,and by using Cred coins,I can reduce the price ofthat item as well,and then that helps mejust save money,and thus make money throughthe exchange.The best thing about Credwhich I thought of usingfundamentally was,I had multiple credit cards,so managing them,tracking their bills,if there has been an undue chargeor a late payment feewhich should not be there,then getting an alert for that,all that is managed by Cred,and that's why it ismy recommended platformfor everything that is got to dowith credit cards.This post is sponsored by Cred.I am dear friends with Kunal,so this is a biased point of view,but I genuinely believe thatif you will use Cred,you will not havea different point of viewfrom what I have,because it is absolutelya product that works along the linesof what I suggested.So number 3, by using Cred,over and above the credit cardreward points,you can get more reward points,and be a part of credit-worthyindividuals through which youincrease your social status.Number 4, and this isvery interesting becausevery few people see credit cardsin this manner.There's something calledthe CIBIL score.I made a detailed videoon CIBIL score,as to how can you increaseyour CIBIL scoreand what is CIBIL score.Basically, the CIBIL scoreis a measure of yourcreditworthiness.Basically, all the banksin our country are connected,and they say,Whoever has taken a loanat some point in time,how to track them?Did they deposit the EMI in time?How much loan have they taken?How much of it is left?Have they ever done a default or not?All of this is tracked ona singular platformand reported through somethingcalled a CIBIL score.CIBIL score is all the way up to 900,and if your CIBIL scoreis greater than 800,then your credit ratingis super amazing.But how does it make a difference?If you use a credit card,you are actually takinga loan for a month or 45 days.And if you are repaying thatcredit card loan every month very well,it means you take a loanfor 1 month, you repay it,then take a loan again,repay it again,then take a loan again,repay it off,and if you do that regularly,your credit rating will be great,it will improve.It will actually be very high,and its direct impact would beon loans that you take in the future.Loans that are meaningful.For example, home loans.A home loan is takenby each one of usat some point or the other,and based on your credit scoreor CIBIL score,the rate of interestyou get on the home loan changes.Did you know that?It is actually different.And if you don't believe me,here is what you should see.LIC Housing Financehome loan interest ratesis based on CIBIL score.As you will see,if your CIBIL score is above 800,then you will get a loan on 8.65.If it is between 750-799,then it will be 8.75.If it is between 700-750,then it will be 9.05.If it is between 600-699,then 9.3, and so and so forth.It seems to you thatthese are very small percentages.Why is Ankur Warikoo getting so excited?Let's look at this on an excel sheet.So on an excel sheet,I've entered all the dataabove the CIBIL score of 800.As it says, 8.65,this number keeps varying,but right now it is 8.65.Let's assume we are takinga home loan of 1 crorefor 25 years.So its EMI would be around â¹80,000,â¹81,536 to be precise.This means, over a period of 25 years,we will give back â¹2 crores 44 lakhsto the bank.The first big shock is thaton a loan of â¹1 crore,we are giving interest ofâ¹1 crore 44 lakhs,but that's a different topic.Let's see what happenswhen your CIBIL score is lowerthan this, 8.75, etc.So will again consider â¹1 crore,so let's make this,enter 25 here,and then calculate the EMI.The EMI increases slightly,not very meaningfully,it becomes 82,000, then 84,000,then 85,000.But let's seehow the total amount differs.And now let's calculatethe extra amount that you pay,and you will see the difference.If your CIBIL score is between750-799,then over the period of this home loan,you will give extra â¹2 lakhs to the bank.If it is between 600-699,then you will give around â¹13.5 lakhsmore to the bank.Same loan, same tenure, same bank,only because of a low CIBIL score,you will give around â¹13.5 lakhsmore to the bank.Why would you do that?Because this money saved is money earned.So the right way to use a credit cardis after using the credit card,make its full payment every month,and you will havea high credit rating,because you will becomea natural loanor credit-worthy individual,and that will tell banks thatif you take a loan, thenthe possibility that you will defaultor you will not pay your EMI on timeis very low,so we can give youa good rate of interest.The fourth way of making moneythrough credit cards.And number 5 is simple, offers.Many credit cards keep running offersat some or the other time.This is over and abovethe reward points thatyou anyway get on your purchase,this is over and above Cred coinsthat you get by makingthe credit card payment.These are mostly cashback offersthat are momentary,but they spike a lot.Whenever there is a festive season,or a sale on Amazon or Flipkart,they start springing up everywhere.For example, some credit cardsare giving flat â¹6,000 or â¹9,000or â¹12,000 off on Apple products.This is like free money.You don't have to do anything.The only thing you need to dois to be the owner of that credit card.So, even if that credit cardhas a yearly fee,which should frankly be not paid,but even if you give it,then you can gain it in justone purchase,and actually earn moneythrough owning a credit card.These 5 ways to be a smart individual,use a credit card to your advantage,because if you deploy that moneyin short-term investments,then you get free money.If you use no-cost EMIs,then you make money.If you use cashback,then you make money.If you pay your bill payment properly,then you get low interest,and thus make money.And if you make yourcredit card payments through Cred,then you earn coins,through which you get multiple accessto save money, to earn money,and then you make money.Money all around!This is a smart way of usinga credit card.Many people think thatcredit card is a flawed thing,but if it is used smartly,which all of us want to doand now know how to do,then you becomea smart financial instrumentand an investor.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
