Recently on my social media platforms,I asked people in their 20s a question,what is your confidence level?And if it is low, then what is its reason?And all the answers that cameamong them, these seven reasonswere the highest.In this video I will share top 7 reasons,for people in their 20sto have low self-confidence.And I will try to give a suggestionor opinion from my side,how can you deal with thisin short term and long term.Number one reasonfor low self-confidence in your 20s,is comparing yourself to others.Almost every person I talked to,or who sent feedback,was saying that our lifeis spent in comparison.We're always checking on Instagramwhat our friends are up to.Our parents keep telling usthat he has got a job here.He has cleared that exam.He has got married.We keep watching the world.People we don't even knowthey're doing so much,Some have got salary in crores,some have in lakhs.Someone has bought this car?Somebody bought that phone.And constantly we keep feelingthat they are winning and we are losing.Constantly we keep feeling,there must be something lacking in us,because we are unable to achieve anything.That results in low self-confidence.It results in them shaming themselves,They are convincedthat nothing will happen through us.And every single timea challenge comes before them,they start being fearful.How to deal with it now?Short term/long term.Short term: Try to understandthat life is not a zero-sum game.What does it mean?This means that if someone wins,it doesn't mean that you have to lose.This means, that if someone goes +1,you don't need to be -1.Life is not a zero sum.Life is infinite sum.It means there's room for everyone.Everyone can win.Everyone can move forward.That is something that life is all about.But long termonly one thing can work for you.And that is, that each and every personis in a race of his own.You are not running with anyone else,you can see other people,but the race is with yourselfyou are running the race yourself.The only thing you can ask yourself is,am I ahead of what I was yesterday or not?And if the answer is yes, you are winningand if the answer is no, you are losing.Where are other people,what they do, how they do it,it doesn't matter.Every personwas born in a different situation,was born with a different experience,grew up with a different experience,and that will determinewhat happens to them in their life,and how they deal with it.The race is within you.Number two reasonfor low self-confidence in your 20s.Fear of failure.Almost every person I talked to,was warned not to give up.Do you remember the Chak De! India scene,talking on the phone,"child, you shouldn't lose."It's engrained in us.We feel numbwhenever we think about defeat.Because we are taught from childhoodthat those who lose are losers,whenever we remember a loss,we feel that if we lose, then the worldwill also declare us as losers.What do you mean?That we don't try.Because we know that we can lose,so what is the best?Don't even try.Because if you don't try,you will neither win nor lose.And life will be perfect.And that is low self-confidence.Don't even try.Not to try at all, to try.How to deal with it?Short term, the biggest advantageof you guys is that you are young.The biggest advantageis that you feel that you are oldbecause you are 21 years old,22 years old,still don't know what to do in life?But you are young.And what does that mean is,you have time to recover from a failure.Even if God forbid you lose,you can recover from that defeat,because there is stilla lot of time left, mate.And that should give you confidence.But long term, only one thing will work,knowing that everyone loses in life.The difference is not thatwho has lost less, who has lost more.The difference is,who has been able to learnsomething from his defeat.The difference is that even after losing,who continues to move forward,because they don't stop at defeat,nor do they climb up instantly.They think on defeat.They think why I lost?They think that how did I reachthis point?What were all those things,which I was sure would not happen to me,but happened.What were the things that I knewwould never happen, but they did.What were the things that I thoughtwould happen, but didn't happen even then.How will I change my life because of this?They reflect upon their failure.And because of this, every defeatbecomes a lesson for them.Something that you can doin your life as well.Low self-confidence in your 20s,number three: Negative self-talk.It was shocking that how many peopleare abusing themselves every day.How many people behavewith themselves in such a waythat they would not behaveeven with their own enemies?They deny themselves.Say, you will not be able to do it.You are not right.No one loves you.You'll never be able to achieve anything.People rightly say,you are not capable of this.You're not ready for this.You'll never be able to reach that point.You won't be able to keep anyone happy.You can't keep yourself happy.You'll not be ableto be with anyone in life.They're constantlytelling themselves storiesthat it's beyond their capabilities.And when you tell yourself those stories,you begin to believe them.We are the stories we tell ourselves.What are we?We are just stories of our mind.The stories in our mindthat we create and weave for ourselves,is what we ultimately become.And that needless to say,results in low self-esteem,if you think negatively about yourself.What might help?Short term surround yourself by content,by people, by ideas, who believe in youmore than you believe in yourself.Because sometimesthat is all is needed in life.One such person who trusts youmore than you trust yourself.But eventually only one thing will workto believe, you are your own best friend.You only know your own mistakes,know your own truth, know your own secret,everything that's happening with you,has already happened,you are aware of that.And that means there is only one person,who can encourage you at level,that no one can.There is only one personwho can see your every flawand still tell youthat there is something right in you.That's you, yourself.Fall in love with yourself.Become your best friend.Number four: Lack of experience.It was very cute and very shocking.Because a lot of peoplein their 20s were sayingthat we do not have experience.And because of thiswe do not have confidence.Experience will come after working, right?No one earns experience at birth.So, I understand, where you coming from.But what should hopefully give youconfidence is, every person in 20s,is almost thinking in the same way.That we don't have experience.We don't have experience.And every personhas passed through this very phase.So there has to be a wayof dealing with it.So what might help?Number one:If you don't have experience,it doesn't matter.You have somethingthat not many people have.Your energy, your ambition, your youth,your eagerness, your curiosity,a passion that is found only in 20s.Because after reaching 30s,reaching 40s, reaching 50s,that spirit begins to gradually wane.A kind of passion,where you want to show you can do.Will show people what we are made of.That is what you can bring to the table.You do not have experience, that's fine.But energy, ambition, curiosity,hunger, restlessnessthis can compensatefor the lack of experience.Eventually there's only one thing,whether you have experience or not,skilled or unskilled,Every task in the world,comes to about only one thing, people.How do you deal with people?So if there is one experience, matethat you start as early as you can in lifeis, how you deal with people.How you get people to work.How you communicate with people.By respecting people, by valuing them,getting the work done by them.Because you know what they are worth.You know what you can give them.You know what they are capable of.Because of this, you becomethe most experienced and skilled person,without necessarilyhaving the actual skills,because you will be getting it doneby your team.Number five:Reason for low self-confidencefor people in their 20s,lack of support.There were many people with whom I spoke.And they feltthat there is no support around them.Support from family, support from friends,support from well-wishers,brother, sister, relative.And because there is no support,you feel alone.And alone is a very, very toughphase to handle.Because in alone, your storystarts all over again in your head.And you start questioningwhy don't you get support?There may be some deficit within you.There may be some deficiency within you.You would not be doing anything.And that then adds itselfand leads to low self-confidence.So how to deal with this?Immediate, seek help online.Internet is a very beautiful world.Yes, it seemsthere is just trolling happening.Only negative talk takes place.But genuinely if you ask someone for help,there are many peoplewho are ready to help.So seek support from peoplethat you do not know right now,but they can become your friends,they can become your well-wishers.They can provide you with the supportthat you are unfortunately not gettingfrom your immediate family or the world.Eventually, the amount of timeyou spend in this world,your only aim should beto make a very small tight groupof mentors and friends.There is no need for a very big world.Many Facebook or WhatsAppor Instagram people are not needed.You need people that you can calleven at midnight and you knowthey will pick up the phone,will help you wherever they are.Wherever they are, will give you a good,objective, honest opinionand that is all the differencebetween winning and not winning.Between confidenceand low self-confidence.So, try to make this groupas much as possible.Not big.Deep meaningful, lasting for years.And that is what ultimatelywill help you there.Number six: Physical Appearance.And this was mostly, I have to admit,among the girls.Many were consciousby their physical appearance.They felt that they are not pretty enough.Not good looking enough.They are fat.They are not attractive.They are not presentable.They are not confidentwhen they are speaking.Many things which were manifestingin physical appearance,and of course, social mediaand the first pointcomparing yourself with others,it aggravates that.Because you see on Instagram,every single person is beautiful,every single person's life is happy.Everyone is wearing very nice clothes.Everyone is eating very nice food.Everyone is on a wonderful vacation.Then you begin to feelthat there is nothing inside you.And you can't changeyour physical appearance overnight.Because there are many thingswith which you are born.And that is just luck.Of course, you can becomefitter and healthier.But you cannot change your face.You cannot change your body structureand that is unfortunately a big reasonfor low self-confidence in young people.What might help?Immediately - Will give an opinion.Maybe unpopular, controversial,but it is my opinion,so take it for what it's worth.If you don't feel confidentwith your physical appearance,dress in a waythat makes you feel confidentand that doesn't mean expensive clothes.It means comfortable clothes.Clothes that make you feel confident,that could be anything.I feel confident in a t-shirtand that could be mine.It doesn't matterwhether that T-shirt is branded or not.Doesn't matter who has worn that T-shirt?When was it bought?Was bought for how much? Does not matter.What matters is, when I wear this T-shirt,when I accessorize myself,when I wear those shoes, wear those jeans,wear those glasses, wear that cap.Whatever the case may be.I feel confident.And that is a short-term fixto your physical appearance.Not somethingthat I would recommend for life.But something that can immediately,at least offer some resolve.Eventually, only one thing will work.To know this and understand,that the people who really love you,love you, because you are you.Not because you look in some way.Ultimately even if it's yourlove relationship, someone you love,maybe marry, maybe have kids with,that person loves you, for who you are.How you look,was an input in the beginning.But ultimately,it becomes a very small variableof a very large equation.That should hopefully give you confidence.That there are people who will love you,will absolutely love you, for who you are,not for how you look.Because of all this,there's one important thing,and that's somethingthat I will highly recommend.Because I have learned from thisin my own life.Nothing is a better gift to yourselfthen to be physically and mentally fit.If you are physically,mentally fit in your life,then it doesn't matter how you look.Because I can give you in writingthat the person who is physicallyand mentally fit,they are always confident.When they look at themselves in a mirror,look at their body, look at their mind,look at their thoughts,they know they are worth it.And that only happens through hard work.Eating right,exercising right, sleeping right,giving respect to your body,appreciating itthat's something that will always help youin the long run.Number seven:The biggest reason,why people in their 20s,have low self-confidence.Lack of direction. People are confused.They don't know what to do in life.They don't know if the college they are inis the right college or not.The course they are doing,is it the right course or not.The exam for which they are preparing,is it the right exam or not.The job they are in,is it the right job or not.The company which they are in,is it the right company or not.They are absolutely lost.There was a beautiful tweet,which I had recently seen which said,our generation, my generation,we suffered because of scarcity.Because of lack of things.This generation is sufferingbecause of abundance.Because of plenty of things.You all have so many choices,You can also become a YouTuber,you can also become an Instagrammer,you can also become a journalist,you can also become a dancer,you can also become a writer,of course, you can become a CA, Lawyer,Engineer, UPSC, Doctor all those things.And that has lead to even more confusionthan ever before.Because there are so many things to do,that now FOMO has taken over.There are so many thingsthat I don't know how to pickand that was the biggest reasonwhy people felt low on confidence.Because they felt that it's only they,and every other person is sorted.Only we are the ones who are donkeys.Only we are the ones who are confused.We are the only ones who do not knowwhat to do in life.Every person is sorted except us.They know what to do.They are so confident,they are preparing for this job,they are preparing for this exam,they are sitting for this placement,they are preparing for that job.Everybody knows, I must be a fool.I must be the dumb one.And that was commonly repeatedin almost all the conversations I had.What might help? Immediately,and there is no way of proving it.But you have to take my word.Everyone is in the same boat as you.Everyone is confused.Everyone is confused.Every person in their 20s is figuring outwhat they want to do in life.You're not alone.You're not alone.You are not alone.You're not alone.Please don't curse yourself so much.Please don't hate yourself so much.Everyone is going throughthe same struggle.Can't see, because it's in their mind.And that should give you hope.It should give you confidence.And ultimately, the same thing,It doesn't matter how old a person is,how long he has lived,with how much experience,every person is figuring outat that point in life,I am figuring out at 42.Even your parentsare figuring out at 50-60.Your elder brother, elder sisterare figuring out even in 30s, in 20s.Everyone is figuring things out.No one's life is sorted or stable.Life changes so fast,world changes so fast,time and circumstances change so fast,that we have no choicebut to keep changing.And that means nothing is constant.We have to understandthat everyone is figuring out.As much as you put yourself in this habit,that you are constantly questioning,is this the right thing for me?Is this what I should do?How should I thinkabout the next thing to do?What makes me happy?What am I good at?What is it that the world needs.You will know, how to move ahead.20s is a very confusing decade.We are always second guessing ourselves.We are always thinkingthat every person is sorted.We always feel likewe should settle down quickly.Or we think thathow will we settle like this,we don't even know what to do now.There is so much of confusion.So many things that are hitting usevery single day.So many big decisions have to be taken.Have to earn money.Have to build relationships.Also have to settle.You have to please your parents too.Have to make friends too.It can be a very, very demanding time.But it is also a defining decade.It does not mean that if you have not doneanything in this decade,then life is over. No.This means that very important thingswill happen in this decade.You will start earning the first time,build meaningful relationships with all.Will make friends.Will learn how to work.Will learn how to live independently.Will hopefully start helping our parents.And all of that, is only going to addto your personality, to your experience,to your confident as well.So, remain patient.Be kind to yourself.Keep telling yourself that I have time.Not because you become lazy.So that even if God forbidthere is a mistake,or you take such a decisionwith which you are very confused,you know that you have time to recover.You know you have time to recover.And that will be the best giftyou can give yourself.I made a very personal video,many years ago,of how I was lost at the age of 24.I will pin that videoin the comment section and description.You should go through it.And you will hopefully seeof what it means to be lostand still find your way through.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
