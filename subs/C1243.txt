Number 5: This space. This is where I take my calls.This again is directly opposite to the balcony which are just showed you. Again, looking the same space. It's the living room area.I check my phone here.I check my social media here.The one-on-one calls that Ihave with my WariCrew team,I take them here.Any other work call, I take that here. What I love about this space is it's almost like an enclosure. So, it feels a little guarded.I have a lovely sofa in front of me.So, I can rest my feet on it as well.I will lounge, depending on thecasual nature of the call,and it'slovely yellow light, natural light,expanse, space, and just me.But it happens thatif I have to take a call,and someone is working in the kitchen, some noise is coming in, those are work from home fallacies. They are always there.But I frankly don't get bothered because my attention stays only on that call.I also never take a callon a speaker phone. I always have my AirPods with me.So, I make sure that I amnot speaking through the airbecause that would makemy voice really loud,and when I am talkingthrough the AirPods,I will also be able tothen have a video call with whom so ever I am having a call with, and it allows me to be very focused, not have anything around me.The best thing isthat in this position,and in this space, using a laptop is uncomfortable.So, I have no other wayof distracting myself,and the only thing that I have to focus on is on the call.Often, when we are on a zoom call, or on a normal call,and we have our laptop near us,we check our mail,we don't talk with full attention,and that is you multitaskingthinking that you are being productive, but the reality is you are not because your attention is divided.
