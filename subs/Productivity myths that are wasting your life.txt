Myth number 1:Multitasking is actuallya great way to work.Often we think if we are doingmany tasks at the same time,then we tend to finisha lot of tasks quickly.So while mailingor while attending a zoom call,we check our Instagram,take down notes,talk to parents or girlfriend/boyfriend,and tell a friend not to comein the evening,and this feels like a lot of work.But it is important to understandthe way our mind works.Our mind always works in sequential order,not parallelly,which means it finishes one taskand then picks up the next, and so on.So if we do many tasks simultaneously,what's actually happening in our mindis that it quickly goes from the firstto the second to the thirdto the fourth task.So it's important to understandwhat is actually happening in our mind.When we do a lot of tasks simultaneously,then our mind keeps jumpingfrom the first to the secondto the third to the fourth task,and then it comes back to tasknumber 1, then 2, then 3, 4,come back to task number 1, 2, 3, 4,and hence our mind gets tired,more importantly,our mind is not attentive anymore.So, it's a big myth that multi-taskingis very important.I would not encourage it.In my life personally, I don't multitask,instead, I do many different tasksin a day or in a week.So a great way to actuallyget a lot of work done is,don't do a lot of tasks at the same time,but you can do a lot of tasks in a day,after identifying your time slot.So you may read a book first,then do something else, and so on,but while you are doing a particular task,you will only be doing thatand nothing else.Myth number 2:Persistence is the best wayto finish a task.This goes completely againstevery possible research out there.Research shows that our brain getstired very quickly,and when we give it a mode ofrest at the time of fatigue,it actually nourishes itselfand becomes sharper and more focused.To accomplish this,there is the Pomodoro technique.Pomodoro technique isa very interesting technique,where you work in a slab of 30 minutes,where you will work for 25 minutesand rest for 5 minutes,work for 25 minutesand rest for 5 minutes.In this 5-minute rest,you will not do anything thatwill make your mind already active.So you will not check Instagram Reelor YouTube.You will close your eyes,drink some water,listen to some music,something that soothes your brain,and then again start Pomodorofor 25 minutes.After 4-5 Pomodoros,you will take a longer breakfor about 15-20 minutes,maybe even half an hour.If you adopt this methodtowards your work,towards your studies, towards any task,you will find yourselfa lot more attentive,you will find yourselfa lot more present in that very task.Myth number 3:If I get a lot of timeto complete this task,then I will do it better.There is a very interesting law calledThe Parkinson's law.It says that the more time you have,your work will take that much timeto be completed.This is something that we all experience.We think we can complete a task in 3 days,but if we take 5 days to complete it,then that task becomes big and getscompleted in 5 days only.We think we can completea task in 2 hours,but if we take 5 hours to complete it,then that task takes 5 hours only.It's almost as if the task increasesmagically as time increases.So it's important for you to recognizethat spending more time on a taskdoesn't mean that the taskwill be completed in a better way.It could be that we are fooling our mindor our mind is fooling us,where it has increased the taskbut the actual task is the same.So a great way to be productiveis to take as much time as you thinkit will take to complete a task.The more and more time you put into it,the more that work will expand,but it won't get better.Myth number 4:Doing more is always better.It's not always right.Often, if you do more because you thinkit will get better, you are makinga mistake because you might be doingsome unnecessary work.There is a very important principlein life, in the world, which is calledthe Pareto principle.It says that often 80% of the impactin our life, in our task,in our decisions,is made by 20% of the work we do.This means most of the impact of your workwill be in a very small area,and if you focus the mostin that small area,if you perform that small task the best,you will find the best impact emerge.That is called smart work.A donkey also works hard,and I do not envy a donkey,but I am just usually saying thata donkey also works hard,but it is still a donkey.It is not enough to work hard,it is very important to work hard smartly.Especially in today's world becausethere is so much technology,so much exposure, so many opportunities,so many ways to do the same task,that to understand which taskwill give you the maximum impact,to put more energy into it,instead of thinking thatif we will work a lot,it will get better.Not always true!Number 5:Distractions are always a wrong thing.The reality is that we cannot escapefrom distractions.There is distraction in the world,our mind wanders, even I get distracted,every human being gets distracted.The difference is how you usethat distraction.If you keep telling your mindnot to get distracted,then your mind will feel like it.What's wrong with getting distracted?!So you're looking at an Instagram Reel,you'll think you'll see one Reel only,after that Reel, a swipe,then another swipe,and that 1 minute you were supposedto spend is now an hour becausethe brain is enjoying being distracted.Why?Because you have told your mindnot to be distracted.It's like when children are told,don't do this,then they go and do the same,our mind also works like this.So here is a good way of actuallydistracting your mind,so that your mind is at peace.You tell your mind thatwe will get distractedbut between this time to this time.You should plan your distraction.I am sounding weirdbut listen attentively.You should plan your distraction.If you tell your mindor put in your schedule thatevery day from 12:30-1 will bemy distraction time,when I will watch Instagram Reels,Netflix, YouTube, Spotify,whatever the case is,or I will get distracted from 4:30-5 p.m.What will happen is your mindwill anticipate that distraction.It will not get restless waitingto get distracted.It knows when to get distracted.It knows that at 12:30 and 4:30,we will have fun,and they would feel excited about it.But at other times,you will be able to focus onwhat you have to do.So distraction is not alwaysa wrong thing.In fact, if you do it ina planned manner,distraction can become a superpower.Myth number 6:You always have to be connectedto the world to win and be productive.It's a big myth,especially in today's world.I often tell people thatI get my news from Twitteror the morning newspaper.I don't watch any news channels,we don't have cable television at home,I don't go on to a news website.So a lot of people ask,how do you get to know what's happeningin the world?And I am like,why is it my responsibility to find outwhat's happening in the world?Or why am I even eager to knowwhat's happening in the world?If it would be very important,guaranteed it would be on Twitter.If it would be very important,guaranteed it would bein the next day's newspaper.If it is instantly impacting my life,guaranteed I will get a call.But this eagerness to know is somethingthat reduces our productivity,since we connect everythingbecause of that.There's email, Twitter, TikTok, Discord,Instagram, LinkedIn, this or that,so we are constantly hearingthe ping of our phone,and that is telling ussomething new has happened,there is something exciting,there is some breaking news.Don't live in FOMO.The day you realize thatthe daily news makes no differencein your life, you will be free that day.And that is when everything thatis news will be defeated,and your productivity will max out.So the myth that you should be connectedto the world all the timeis a big damaging myth.Don't believe that.Number 7:Those people sleep who do not wantto win in life.Who sleeps?Complete your sleep in 4-5 hours,move ahead, the world is so big,there is so much to win, so much to learn,where is the time?!Go back to the principal again.Research has shown that wheneveryour mind and your body feel rested,its ability to focus is a lot higher.Don't mess with your sleep.Please give yourself as much sleepas your mind and body need.You need more sleep as you get older.In fact, in the teenage years,you need a lot of sleep,because there are hormonal changes,and the body requires that restto understand how that changeis affecting the body.You don't need it so much in your 20s,but it is still important,6-7 hours of sleep in a day is important.Put it in rhythm, make it a routine,sleep and wake up at the same time.It's not necessary for youto wake up early,it's more important that you wake upat the same time every day,because if you disregard sleepand its importance,you may not feel exhausted at that time,but gradually you will be releasingso much of stress and exhaustionin your body that you will startfeeling burnt out,and the next thing you knowat the age of 26-27 itself,you will be like,I can't do it.And it's game over.At the peak of your life,you will start giving up,and that is stupid!Don't disregard sleep.It's a big myth that sleepis not important,or those people sleepwho don't want to win.It's wrong!Number 8:Daydreaming is wrong,it was only a joker's task,we won't do it.Daydreaming has actually been provento help our focus.Goes back to the same thing.Do you remember the Pomodoro principle?A half an hour slab,work for 25 minutes, rest for 5 minutes.If you daydream in during that rest,think about something, without any phone,without any book, without any music,without any person,and you are just thinkingand gradually your thoughts take yousomewhere else,and you are doing something else only,and then you suddenly realize,Oh! I was daydreaming!And then you come back, it actually helps.It helps!It's been proven that it helps!Why?Because in a way, your mind goesto its natural state,in a state that it wants to be,and that helps it recover fromeverything that you were throwing at it.Whatever you were learning,whatever you were doing,whatever you wanted to study or achieve,the mind is processing a lot of things,so if it is possible for itto go back to its world,then it suddenly feels betterand a lot rested and relaxed.So daydream, not for hours,not even for minutes,for some moments,because it actually helps youin your productivity.Productivity myth number 9:People who plan are very inflexible,their life is very tight,very regimented,it doesn't have flexibility.Wrong!When you plan,you prepare your mind in a way.Our mind is always restless.It wants us to take decisions,it wants us to tell what to do,so that by dispensingthe least amount of energy,it tries to complete that task.But when we plan,our mind calms down,because we tell it,we'll do this at 8 in the morning,or we have to completethese 3 tasks today,or we have to talk tothese 3 people today,or we have to finishthese 3 chapters today,or we have to finishthis presentation today,or we'll do these thingsfor the next 3 days,Whatever is it that you create as a plan,helps your mind settle down.And the more your mind is settled,the more relaxed and focused you'll feel.Because what providesthe most distraction?Your mind,which keeps wandering,which keeps reminding youto do so many things.But if you give a to-do list to your mind,if you give a prioritization orderto your mind,if you tell your mind that these thingsare important but these things are urgent,then your mind will start understanding,it will start understanding you,it will start understanding your things,and that will make you relaxedand a lot more productive.So planning is important.It is a myth that planning makes youinflexible.Number 10:People with routines are very boring.Wake up in the morning,do pranayam at 5:30,then do something at 6,then something else at 7.Look at Ankur Warikoo.He does this, then this, and so on.What a boring person!I've often heard this.And people who follow a routinehave also heard this many times.Routine makes people boring.It's a misconception that routinemeans boring.A routine doesn't mean thatyou live your life like a robot.We'll do this, then this, then this.Routine means that you plan your mindand your daily schedule in a waythat you know what you want toachieve at that time.For example, I have a morning routine,and it is absolutely cut-to-cut,where I wake up at a certain time,then meditate, then read,then get the children ready,then play tennis, then to the gym,then get ready,then read the newspaper,and have breakfast,and it is absolutely cut-to-cut.That's something I love.Yes, it could be boring,but I don't even have anythingexciting to doat that time.It's not like I have to go toa party or something,it is just my morning and my time.But work time also has a routinebut it has a lot of flexibility,it's not that boring.I don't plan what to do at what time.I'm just saying that for the next 3 hours,I have to check my emails,read some content,maybe read some books,talk to some people,learn about something,think about something,and it is flexible.I will do what I want foras long as I want,and that is something that helps me a lot.So routine actually bringsin a level of disciplinethat again helps your mind.The fundamental thing is thatyour mind wanders.The more you can controland relax your mind in a balanced manner,the more productive you will be,and a routine helps you get there.And finally, myth number 11:Maybe the biggest mytharound productivity.If I'm busy in life,then I'm productive in life.This is the biggest mistake.Everybody thinks that if they are busy,then they are productive.So we start creating work.We are ready to do anything to be busy.We take random tasks,spend hours on random work.We sleep at a certain time,live at a certain time,we don't eat, don't talk to people,and just keep busy with our workin the belief that this busynessis making us productive.But that's the wrong conclusion.All these myths that I told you,their summary is just one.Being busyis not being productive, my friend.Being productive meansthat in the least time,you create and achievethe most outcome and output.If you can get to that point,then it doesn't matterif you worked for just 2 hours a dayor 4 hours.You create the most impactwhen in the least timeyou can create the most impact.That is the mark of a successful person.That is the mark of a productive person.Become that person.Not the person who keeps slogging,but instead the person who doesso much in very little timethat people think it's justa play for them,but it is not a play for them,just that they have understood their mind.Cheers to a productive selfand a productive 2023.Don't ever forget these 11 myths.I hope this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
