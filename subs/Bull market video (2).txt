Alright video rolling audio rolling check 1 2 and goWhen stock market is in a bull run orbull market, then what should be yourstock investment strategy,letâs get to know in this video.Friends, these days stock market is at anunprecedented high, especially in India,almost every month the BSE or NSE indexis touching a new height, and because ofthat many new investors, those investorswho are just starting their stock market investingjourney are very scared, because theyare not sure whether this is the right timeto enter or not. So, in this video, I willshare with you, my understanding ofoperating in a bull market and hopefullythrough that, give you a little bit of confidence,on how to ride this bull market,and how you can start your stock marketinvesting journey without hampering it.First of all, what is a bull market, bear market?So, bull market is the definition thatapplies not only for the stock marketbut for any other market as well,where the prices of stocks keep increasingfor an elongated period of time,which is what we see right now.If you see the chart on the screen,then you can see that from March 2020 till now,market has been growing more and more.There was one dip during the second wave,because of which there was a decline,but general trend is completely upwards.This is called a bull market.A bear market is the opposite of that,where prices keep declining continuously,not for a short time but continuously.This is for a market, not only for a stock.So, if a stock goes up or down,then that is not called bull stock or bear stock.The index of the whole market or Sensex,if the prices keep going up or down there,then it is called a bull or a bear market.There is not much clarity about its genesisor its origin, but if you see a bull attacking,then it attacks with its horns up in the air,so that is like up, but when a bear attacks,it swipes down, from up to down.So, people say that it is symbolic of howthese two animals, bull and bear, attack,but you know what, we donât care, we careabout definition and that is most important.So, the question is, if the market is on a rise,then maybe itâs going to dip as well atsome point of time, so is it the right timeto buy or should we buy when it dips?This is a big question which will be there on anyinvestorâs mind, and I want to address it.The big difference is, whether you areinvesting from a short-term gain perspectiveor a long-tem gain perspective.If you are short-term investor, which meansyou do day-trading, or trade in Futures and optionsfor a short period, or think to buy a stockand sell after a month when its price increases,then this may not be applicable to you.This video is not for you.This video is for long-term investors.If you are a long-term investor thenI want to show you through data,that even if you enter in a bull market,then over a long-term period, you willultimately end up gaining and not losing.But there are a few things youwill have to keep in mind.First, I will show you the data so thatyou are fully convinced, and after thatI will show you the strategies.Friends, as you can see on the screen,I have taken Infosys stock. Infosys is adream company, so if you can see, it is max,which means the whole journey of Infosys,it started around 2000, now we are in 2021,so you can see their 21-year journey,and clearly you will see that if I take thestock from this point to this point,then it has been an almost 900% gainand all-time it has gained by 12,815%.,itâs a weird number. It means that if youwould have invested â¹1,00,000 inthe Infosysâ IPO, or when it started,Sorry, I have to make sure I get this number right.Just a secondThatâs what I wanted to make sureWe will show this as well so that people understandShivam, I am sweating, whenever I sweatI remember Shivam, without any fault of his, butOkWe will start all over again, recordingSo, on the screen, you can see Infosys stockwhich was a favorite stock. It is max, whichmeans the whole duration of Infosys.You will see if you go from the beginningtill end, then it is a fairly nice trajectory.Its all-time gain is 12,815%!What!!!Letâs do this in Excel sheet, 12815%,If you have invested â¹1,00,000 in Infosys stock,then today its value would beâ¹1,29,00,000So, it seems like it is great thing, I shouldhave absolutely done it! But this is wherethe difference lies. If you see only5 years journey, so weâll now look atthe last 5 years, then there were manytimes friends, that it seemed like themarket was high, then it dipped andthen again it rose. For instance, if I talkabout 7th September 2018 and then I godown to 22nd November 2018, the stockfell down by 15% in just these many days.15%, yeah! It is not a small amount.If you look here, at 6th September 2019and then I go to 25th October 2019,within a difference of a month, it felldown by 24%. If you look at 20th February 2020and then we will go down to 2oth March 2020,which was the start of the Covid erain India, it was down by 26%!So, itâs quite possible that wheneveryou have been an investor in Infosys,you must be scared at these points,or you must have felt thatit is the time to buy more.The main key point that I am tryingto make is, there is never a straight linein stockâs journey, you will alwaysget returns over a period of time,but fluctuation will keep happening.The key is to stay invested.You donât know when the market will dip,you donât know when the market will rise,you keep invested, and there aresome strategies, that youâll follow.Same thing, if we look at Reliance,Reliance has given an all-time of 4133%,which means if I enter 4133 here,then if I would have investment of â¹1,00,000in Reliance, they would have becomeâ¹42,00,000 by now. and you will see this,such huge dips. If I look at 29th August 2008and then compare it with 28th November 2008,there is a dip of 46%, meaning the stock priceor your invested amount was halved,and you would imagine, âThis money is gone!âOr if you would be invested at this point,which was what, 28th December 2007,and then 28th November 2008, 58% wipe-out,and you would think, âSell the stock and move on!â,but if you would have sold the stock at this point,when it was for â¹250, then you would havemissed out the entire journey.So, every stock will have its ups, its downs.Asian Paints is a great story, look here,for the longest time the stock hadno movement, for the longest time it didnâtmove at all and now its at a gain of25,390%!which means â¹1,00,000, would havebecome â¹2,55,00,000, if you would haveinvested in Asian Paints during its IPO.But again, massive highs, massive lows.You look at Adani, which is somethingwe all keep talking about, 2000%.You look at Google international stock, 4400%.So, these are all-time numbers and theseare massive numbers, because oncompound rate they will keep givingyou 15-20% return in a year.The key takeaway from this data is,stay invested, because over along-term period, stocks keep rising.Why do stocks keep rising?Because companies keep performing,as companies perform, their earnings orprofit increase, if there shares more or lessremain the same, then the earnings per shareincreases and earnings per share thenbecomes a reflection of the value of aparticular companyâs share, and I willnow keep betting in the future,because this company is somethingbecause of which I will keepearning profit year on year.Now of course, there are enough companiesthat do not follow this trajectory.There are many examples where thecompanies were doing really well butafter a period of time they stopped growing,they stopped innovating and then theirstock price decreased, never came backand those are enough stories as well.And that is why you need a strategyfor a bull market or a point wherethe market is on a continuous rise.Here are the strategies that I want to share:Number 1, stick to quality. When everystock is on a rise in the bull market,then you get greedy to invest in smallstocks which are cheap or those stockswhich are growing rapidly. If there isa random Warikoo stock whichdoubled in a month and you wouldwant to buy it, but who is Warikoo,which stock, which company?! It doesnâtmatter, stick to quality. Whenever there isbull market, stick to quality stocks.Those companies which have a goodmanagement, are market leaders intheir category, their industry, they areshowing consistent profitable growth,and that is what you have to stick to.Thatâs number 1.Number 2, if you have already enteredthat market, you were already investedand now you in a bull market, then slowlyand gradually sell a little and book your profit.Letâs say, you bought a stock at â¹100,and now it is at â¹140 and on a rise,then it is advisable that you sell someof your stock, not all of it, sell some of thatstock and book your profit. After booking,just keep the profit with you, because afterbull market, bear market will inevitably come.As I showed through the data market ison a rise and after that it will definitely fall,rise again and fall again, again riseand then fall, but in a long-term it will rise.So, whenever the market will dip,you need to have money, that is whatis called liquidity, if you do not have moneywhen the market is down, then that isthe worst tragedy. So, you need tobook little bit of amount as your profit,keep it next to you, and whenever themarket dips, buy more of the same stock,because you know it will rise again,if the fundamentals are clear. If you areentering the bull market for the first time,then of course you cannot book profit,so you stay where it is, but when youhave bought it and after that it increased,then book a little bit of profit and keep it aside.So, you rose on the short-term momentumyou saw and you booked your profit,and now you are patiently waiting for itto go down, but overall, over a long-termperiod, it will still be a good asset to buy.Third, in a bull market or a bear marketor in general, the best strategy is SIP,Systematic Investment Plan, because everymonth irrespective of the price you are buying,even if you are buying the same stock.So, imagine you are here, letâs go intothe last one year, for instance this isAsian Paints, and you bought a stockworth â¹1700 on 25th June 2020, thenon 25th July you again bough it for â¹1700,then on 25th August you again boughtthe same stock for around â¹2000,and then you bought the same stockfor â¹1900 on 25th September. So, everymonth you will keep buying that stock,its price may increase or decrease,but basically you are tracking a momentumoverall, which is the momentum that you see.So, in the past year, you gained 80%.Now, how would you get that 80%?If you would have invested all the moneyin the beginning of the year and thenwaited for the whole year, but you donâthave that much money, no lumpsumamount, so you can invest every monthand that is the best thing. In that case,your gain would not be 80%, it will bemuch lesser, but it will still bemuch much much higher than you tryingto time the market that, âI will buyAsian Paints when it will be the lowestand not before thatâ, because there is no wayfor you to know when that will happen.And finally, please keep tracking thatmomentum. Since the market is bull,it doesnât mean that every stockâs pricewould increase, some stocks may decrease,maybe there is something else going on,so please stay true to the momentum.You are riding a bull market, meaning themomentum of stock that you are buyingshould also be increasing like bull market.If it stirs, goes in the opposite directionof the market, then please note it andmake the changes. Donât expect thatsince the market is bullish, so all thestocks will rise, that is not how it works.Broadly, this is the best time to enter becauseall the fundamentals are in place,I donât know if a better period than thiswill come, if it will come then who knowswhen, and that is why do not wait forthe âmarket to go lowâ, instead wheneveryou see a bull ride, then start betting on it.Stick to SIP, stick to quality,slowly and gradually reap your profits,keep it aside and wait patiently,when the market goes down, buy more,that is the best way for you to enter a bull market.Data has proven that over a long-period of time,you will have your money increase and significantly.Become a wise investor, start investing right now.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
