Number 1: Passive investing.Where you invest in stockswhich want to hold for the long term.How does this work?Its pros are:You don't have to check your portfolioevery day.You know that over a period of time,it will grow into a wealthyand a rich proposition for you.But the con is that you need to knowthe stocks which over a long periodof time can give you that wealth creation.So you will have to research,you will have to be an expert.You will have to build a thesis thatwhy are investing in themfor the long term?So on and so forth,so it's quite difficult,but of course, not impossible.Coffee Can Investing which isa strategy of Ambit Capitalis in my opiniona passive investing model,where you pick those stocks thatshowed good revenue growthfor several years,good profit growth for several years,return on equity has been good,so on and so forth, and that's whyyou know that these are stable companies,large companies,healthily growing companies,so I can park my money thereand forget about it,and that will become a wonderful wayfor you to make money over a long term.Its direct opposite is number 2,it's called active investing.In active investing, you beton those stocks which you knoware rapidly changing so you are investedin them over a short period of time.Its most common form is day trading,where you buy and sell stockswithin a day,because you are betting onthe price movement.There are a lot of investment strategies,active investing strategieswhich change weekly.For example, I'm invested in smallcasesthat are momentum strategy led,where you bet on a stock pricebecause its stock price is increasingand you will ride on that momentumbefore it starts falling.So it can give you that gain ina short period of momentum only,but if you keep accumulatingthese gains over time,then over a period of time,your returns can become very healthy,while over a short period of time,you will have to change rapidly.So what is the pro?The pro is that you canmake sizable returnsover a long period of time despitethe fact that you would be buyingand selling stocks almost every day.But the con is that it is time-consuming.Becoming an active trader is a 24/7 jobin that sense, it's a full-time role.It's not like you just buy or sell stockswhenever you feel like,instead it requires a lot of research,a lot of technical understanding,a lot of number crunching, and time,because you have to buy and sell stocksevery day, or take a call whetherto hold a stock or sell it that dayor the coming week.Number 3: Growth investing.Growth investing is the most common formof investing where you investin the stocks of those companieswhich you know are riding on their growth,and that is a wonderful way to unlockunreal returns over a period of time.Technology stocks in the US overthe last 10-15 years have prosperedbecause of the approach ofgrowth investing.If you go back to 2005-2006,and you would say,I want to invest in a companylike Facebook.Facebook was not public at that timebut if you would want to,it is so random, right?Facebook is a new company,you don't know how big it would be,what kind of role wouldthe technology play,will the social network expand or not,but if you invested in that growth,because year on year it had 100% growth,50% growth,and you would have bet on that,you may see phenomenal returns comethrough over a decade and more.Tesla is a great example.Tesla was unprofitable for so many years,but still, people kept investing in itbecause they believed that this sectorand this player have some solidity,and if we keep investing in the growth,not necessarilyfinancial profitable growth,but early on just revenue growth,capacity growth, market share growth,then maybe at some point,it will unlock and create a massivewealth creation opportunity for us.Number 4: In slight contrastis the value investing approach.Value investing approach sayswe should invest in a company thatwe think is underpriced,or its value is lesserthan what it should be.Warren Buffett follows this approach.So what does Warren Buffett do?Warren Buffett says,I want to sit on my money,and the day I will see a great companywhose fundamentals are good,management is good,market share is good, industry is good,segment is good,but for some reason,I am getting it at a low price,then I will buy that,and then I will hold onto it.I will just sit on it for years and years,decades and decades,and it will give me a massive multipleover a period of timebecause it will gradually and consistentlytry to come back to the value.Its pro is again that it is very passive,so you can park your moneyand adopt the approach ofbuy it and forget it.But the con is thathow to find out the value,because it requires an approach, right?For example, a very common approachfor value investing is called FCF analysisor Free Cash Flow analysis,that we will assess the free cash flowof the company,or at the end of the year,how much cash is generatedin the business,and then we will try to predict itin the future, and then try to bring itback to the presentthrough a discount rate.Don't try to get technical,but that's the way it is done.If that value is more thantoday's stock price,that means the company isundervalued today,so we might take a bet on it.But that's really hard!Who has that time?Who has that patience?Who has that knowledge?And that is why value investing,while it is such a great way tomake money,is the hardest way to do it,because it requires a lot of patienceto continue waiting for the right timeto make that investment.Number 5: Income investing.It's quite interestingand this is something that a lot of peoplewould wantbut it is difficult to build early on.Income investing means whatever stocksyou buy will give you a regular income.Forget the fact that the stock pricemight be increasing or not,but there is a regular income.How does that happen?In stocks, that happens through dividends.There are a lot of stockswhose stock price doesn't move rapidly,but they declare dividends every year.This means whatever profit they earnat the end of the year,they distribute a percentageof that profit among their shareholdersin the form of dividends.So, without selling the stock,you start getting an income.Another way of doing it outside ofthe stock market is tobuy corporate bonds.Corporate bondsor fixed income instrumentsare those where a company asks for a loan,not from banks,but from let's say, retail investors.It says,I require this many crores,my company is good, it's stable,I have taken a lot of money from bankbut I want to borrow some moneyfrom you as well, so for this,I will give you a 10% rate of interest.And you then give that moneyand you get that regular incomewhich is in the form ofa 10% rate of interest.It's almost like you are lendingyour money to a company,and if that company is stablethen your money would also be stablein a way.These are the ways that you generatemoney or cash flowthrough your investmentsand that's why it's calledan income strategy.Number 6: Contrarian investment strategy.This means, the direction thatthe market is going in,you will go in the opposite direction.It's very interesting because you makethe most money in this.I am not suggesting that this isa great way to do itbecause it's very difficultand it needs a lot of guts.What does it mean?The day the market is down,you buy on that day.When everybody is selling,you are buying.And when the market goes up,when everybody is buying,you are selling.And this could be true for the market,it could be true for a stock as well.As the stock price increases, you sell.As the stock price decreases, you buy.This is you going againstwhat the majority market is trying to do.And why do you do this?Because you have a belief system,or you may think that a companyis overvalued or undervalued.For example, a lot of people shot Tesla.Shot means that they are bettingthat the price of the Tesla stockis going to go down,and that is exactly opposite towhat the market is trying to do because,for the past many years, Tesla stockis increasing only, but few peopleinsist that Tesla is overvalued,its stock price should not be this much,and that's why we'll shot its stock.In other ways, in the Indian market,you can say, when the market goes up,then I will book my profits,and I will wait forthe market to come down,and the day market will go down,I will buy into the market,and then try and book it againwhen the market goes up.That's called a contrarian viewbecause it is contrary to the main view.And finally, number 7 which ismy favorite because it might bethe best for a beginner investor.It's called the indexing strategy.Indexing strategy means thatI do not want to rack my brains,I want to follow the index.What is an index?It's the whole market.For example, in India,there are two indexes,National Stock Exchangeand Bombay Stock Exchange,and they have their own indexes.Nifty 50 is a great index.It is the index comprisingthe top 50 stocks onthe National Stock Exchange.So, those 50 companies,which are the largest 50 companiesin India, we will be investing in that.And as they move, so will our money.The beauty about that is thatyou are in some way bettingon the collective story of the country,because if you trust your country,then in a way, you trust these50 companies too, and that's why you betand ride on the index.What I love about this isit's very passive.You don't have to actively manage it.Somebody else would be doing it for youbecause some mutual fund or smallcasewould be actively managing it for you.It is passive in the sense thatthere is not a lot of fluctuation,because they are the top 50,and I am talking about the index Nifty 50,there are a lot more indexes,but the index of Nifty 50does not fluctuate much,because these 50 companiesare very stable,they grow gradually, but they grow stableand consistently,so you will ride on that.You won't be getting a heart attackevery day about how much money youlost or gained and so on.And third, it doesn't require youto be an expert.You will be ridingon somebody else's research,which is not just the companymanaging the fund,but also these companiesmanaging their own business,so when you buy into Nifty 50,then the top 50 companies of the countrywork for you, and they go to officeand work every day to grow your money,and that is beautiful.The con is that the return may not beas exciting as any other strategy.Why?Because you are betting on somethingwhich the whole world knows,and there is no new nuanceor any secret formulabecause of which your return can be morethan somebody else's.But you know what?It may not be a bad return as well.In the index,Nifty 50 in the last 10-20 years,on average has given a return of 13-15%which is not bad if you just take itfor 10-20 years.13-15% means your money will doublein every 5 years.So in 20 years, your money will growfrom 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8,and 8 to 16 times which isa remarkable way of looking at your money,and that's why this is one ofmy favorite investing strategies.Which is your favorite investing strategyfrom these 7, or is there an 8th strategywhich you
