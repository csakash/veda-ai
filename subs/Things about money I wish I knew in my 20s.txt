Things about moneyI wish I knew in my 20s.There are 23 such things, Piyush.So, will play it nicely.All right.Number 1:It doesn't matterhow much you are investing.It depends on how long you are investing.This is the fundamental principlethat we are never told in our 20s,so we never start.We feel that there is still time,we will do it in our 30s,will do it in our 40s, why now?They are still days of youth.Days of debauchery.Days to spend.Days to live life.But what we fail to recognizeis that any amount of moneythat you can invest,be it â¹500, â¹100, â¹1,000, 5,000,if you start in your 20s itself,then you will earndisproportionately higherevery single year.To give you a simple comparisonevery 10-year delay,halves your investment.It means,if you start your investment in 20 years,same amount, and do it till 60 years,whatever you earn in those 40 years,if you start at 30 yearsand if you put the same amounttill 60 years,then your amount becomes half of that.If you start in 40 yearsand if had done it for 60 years,then even that halfwould have been halved.Means, only one quarter.And that is how much delay impacts it.So, start investing today.Number 2:Budgeting is the best wayto get everything in life.Many people feel that if they invest,they are not living life.No, that is not a right way to do it.The right way to think about thisis budget all the money you earn.I wish someone had told me this.50% of your moneyshould go towards your needsYour needs, be it your EMI,be it your rent, your electricity, water,living expenses, food expenses,the needs that you need to live life.30% for your wishes.Want to buy a phone? Absolutely buy it.Want to go on vacation? Definitely go.Have to party, buy clothes, do everything,but only within this 30%.If that 30% is not enough,then save every month,adding to that 30%,bring it to how much you want.And then 20%, at least 20%,invest every month for the long term,for things you would want.For buying that car, that education loan,that marriage, that children's expenses,that retirement expenses, that everythingcan come out of this 20% of yoursand that is something you should know.Number 3:In the beginning of life,please don't take loan.We feel very good that someoneis ready to give us money,when we do not have that money.But that debt will hold you back.Do not take home loan early in life.You will only be able to buya small house.You will be stuck in that place,in that colony, in that city,Will keep paying its EMIs throughout lifeand will never be able to get out of it.That fear will just eat you up.Instead do everythingthat you can do with your own money,without taking a loan.I always say that in a lifetime,you are to take a maximum of two loans.One, loan for your studiesbecause it is an investment in itself.It is absolutely necessarythat you take a loan for studies.And second, home loan.But only when you are settled,have a family.You know, you will live in this city,will live in this house,that is all that is needed.And that would be around the age of 35-40.This is what I did.Iâve gained a lot from it.I wish you do too.Number 4:Invest in yourself.The best investment friend,is inside yourself, on yourself.Many people ask me,sir I am ready to invest â¹500,where should I put it?I say man, you can invest,can invest in mutual fundsthat money will keep growing,but with that â¹500 if you buya new course every month.A course that teaches you something new,gives you a new skill,trains you for a new technology.Can you imagine, because of thathow much your earning potential increasesThat is why, that is a better investment.Yes, saving money is important.Earning money is necessary.But what is its source?You yourself.So, invest in yourself.That is the best investment to make.Number 5:Never invest in FOMO.In our 20s, we keep feeling a lot,friend, he invested,he made so much money,he invested,he became rich overnight,so we should also do the same.Whenever you invest in FOMO,you will always lose money.Because you do not knowwhy you are putting that money.You are investing only and onlybecause of greed.That is almost alwaysthe wrong way of treating money.Number 6:Avoid lifestyle inflation.What is lifestyle inflation?That as your income increases,your lifestyle increases at the same rate,in fact, it increases faster.So, your income goes from 100 to 110,but you bought those new clothes,took that membership,bought that car.Bought every single thing,due to which your expensesare increasing not that fast,but even faster than that.Wrong way of living life.Always keep your expenses low.Definitely keep it lesser than the incomeand gradually increase it.I am not saying that by becoming a saint,by sacrificing everything in life,and live life in that way.No, have fun.Do as much as you can.But you will increaseyour income more quicklyand as your income increases,it is not compulsory that your expensesshould also increase in the same way.If you increase your income,divert a lot of ittowards your investment.Number 7:The earlier you can buy life insurance,the better.When you are young,your probability of dying is less.This means,whatever life insurance cover you have,its premium will be lowestwhen you buy it early or young.So, my suggestionis to take life insurance before 25.Take it till 65, maybe even beyondso that God forbidif something happens to you,or if something happens to your income,then your familydoesn't have to bear that burden.And they are financially secure.Number 8:Because of this,when you buy life insurance,don't look at it as an investment,only buy term-life insurance.Lot of people will try to sell you ULIPor will try to sell guaranteed returns,all of those give you returnswhich are really, really poorin comparison to what you can get outside.And forcibly you have to paya higher premium for them.Don't make that mistake.Term insurance says thatyou will pay a fixed premium for a coverand if God forbid,you happen to die during that term,your nominee gets whatever your cover is.If God willing, you don't die,you get nothing.And it may seem like a bad deal,but trust me, when you do that math,you will be able to recognizethat this is the best thingyou can buy for yourself.Because at a young ageitâs available very cheaply.If I remember right,you can get a cover of 1 crorefor as low as â¹15,000 or â¹18,000 a year.Which means about â¹1,000-2,000 a month.This will remain fixedfor the entire term.So initially this â¹1,000-2,000might sting a little.But after 5-10 yearsthis â¹1,000-2,000 will not be much.Because your income would have grown.Inflation would made it easier.And imagine when you are 40-50 years old,the same cover,which would be a meaningful amount,you would be getting in peanuts,because you bought early.Number 9:Whenever you use a credit cardand do it, definitely, do it properly.Ensure that 100% of the monthly billis paid every single time.Whenever that minimum amount is due,which is veryâ¦Only the minimum amount is due.With this I will be able to spend more.By paying only this much moneymy credit card will continue to work.Never do that mistakebecause any amount due on a credit card,you pay 35-40% interest for the year.Which makes it the most expensive loanout there and you should not ever,make that mistake.So, the monthly bill of credit cardis always 100% paid in full.Number 10:Create an emergency fund.God forbidif something happens to your incomeand recession time is approaching now.Lay-offs are happening,you need to insurethat your monthly expenses remain intact.And for that you do not haveto beg from anywhere.So minimum 6 monthsand ideally 12 monthsâ expensesshould always be with you.So, whatever your monthly expenses are,the expenses of necessities, yes.Not of desires.Not that, hey can do this too,can do this too.Whatever is your need,multiply that month's expenses by 6,multiply by 12, and that amountshould be your emergency fund.Somewhere in between.Where to keep this emergency fund?You can keep 70% in a fixed deposit.That fixed deposit should be suchthat on breaking it,you do not have to pay any penalty.You can keep 20% in your savings accountand always keep 10% in cash with you.This is the best way to insurethat your emergency fund is secure.And the same time, If God forbid,something happens to you,then instantly you have moneyto help yourself.Number 11:As you do your job,you have to create passive income streamsor side income streams as well.Here is a fact.If the income level was â¹100 in 2012,then in 2022 that income levelhas become â¹130.But the thing which was availablefor â¹100 in 2012,is now available for â¹160 in 2022.This means things are getting costlier,but income is not increasing that fast.So, the only way for you to continuemaking money is to have multiplepassive income streams or side incomes.I recently made a video on passive Incomewhich you can check out.This should be the year in your lifewhere you create passive income streams.Something you 100% need to do in your 20s.Number 12:Give yourself before giving to anyone.Remember that when you get money,you have already given to the governmentin taxes,then give it to the bank in EMI,then give it to someone else,and you spend your life with what is left,and worse, invest from the same.That's not the right way to do it.My suggestion,as soon as your money comes,similarly in a second bank account,whatever you want to invest,the money should directly go there first.And in the money that is left,you have to take outyour monthly expenses,you have to pay EMI in it.In that, have to do all the thingsthat are necessary for you to do.Because you have paid yourself firstand then you are finding ways,how to spend the rest of your lifewith whatever money is left.Number 13:It is important to knowthat inflation is a reality.Your money is depreciating by 6% yearly.So, it is your responsibilitythat as the prices of thingsare increasing,the status of your money,its value should not fall.So, you have to invest your money.And invest in such a way that at leastit can beat the rate of inflation.My last videois around inflation-proof investing.Which will tell you,what are the things you can adopt in 2023,so that you can beat inflationand make your money work for you.Number 14:Due to this, tax fees are a reality.Whenever you buy anything,keep an eye on the taxes.Keep an eye on the fees.If you are taking a subscription,how much are you paying?If you are investing something,how much tax do you have to pay on it?If you are employing or hiring an adviser,how much will they charge?If you are buying mutual funds,then how much is its exit load,how much is its expense ratio.If you are buying smallcase,what is its fees?Whatever is it that you are usingto make your money growor to buy something,please never ignore taxes and fees.Because they are realities.And at the end of it,whatever money you will get,it will be net of tax only.Number 15:Be willing to take risks in your 20s.There are many people in your 20swho want to have fixed deposits, why?There is only one reason.Because there is fixed rate of return.Dude that fixed rate of returnis not even beating your inflation.Please you can take risk at this time.Because if God forbid,your risk doesnât work,you still have time to recover from it.But at the age of 40-50you will not be able to take the risk.There will be family responsibility,there will be your own old age,income will not be predictable.At that point of time, you will be stuck.Now is the time for you to explore.Now is the time for you to riskwith your money and when I say risk,I don't mean do fixing and gambling.What it means is,try to understand the riskand be comfortable with itif over a long period of timeit gives you a healthy return.Stock market is the best example.On a yearly basis,it will sound very risky.Sometimes up, sometimes down,sometimes up, sometimes down.But over a long period of time,5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years,it will give you almosta healthy rate of returnin the upward direction.So why not take that risk?Iâm ready to take the risk for 1-2 years,if for 5-10 yearsI get a healthy rate of returnand that is exactly what youhave to think about, in your 20s.Number 16:Early on, when looking for jobs,don't focus on money,focus on learning.In our 20s we feelthat money will solve everythingand yes, money is necessary.I am not ignoring it at all,but when you focusonly and only on money,you tend to make short-term decisions.Got a little more money here, went here.Got a little more money there, went there.Our learning becomes hollow.We arenât able to build any foundation,Arenât able to create any foundation,So at the end of it,when you're in your 30s,When people start paying youfor your experience,start paying money for your judgment,for your knowledge.You will find yourself lost,because you would not have spentenough money, sorry enough time,to invest in that.So early on focus on your learning.Optimize for your learning,while ensuring that the minimum moneyyou need to live life,you are getting that.But it shouldnât be,where you get more money, run there,irrespective of getting somethingto learn there or not.Number 17:Whatever your material goals are,you want to buy a car,you want to buy a house,you want to go on vacation,you want to do this,you want to do that,please set that goal.But don't put a timeline on them.Because that timelinewill make you feel unnecessary pressure.Your life is not a failureif you haven't bought a house in 30 years.Your life is not a failure at all,you didn't buy that expensive carin 35 years,didn't do that foreign vacation,and so on and so forth.In life, when you are dying,you will only say thatyou were capable enough to buy a house.Were capable enough to take the children,family, and parentson an international vacation.Were capable enough that did X.Will not say that friendhad to buy a house for 30 years,bought it at 31, so I am such a failure,what is the use of dying now.That is useless, right.That's not how we think.So, think about what you will feel like,when you do this,not by when you do this.Because timeline there,it creates a lot of unnecessary pressureand it has no foundation.There is no scientific logic anywherethat we have to do this till 30 years,till 25 have to do this,till 35 have to do this.We just put that burden on ourselvesand then we suddenly startcrushing ourselves under that pressure.Wrong way of living life.Number 18:Never buy anythingto impress other people.Only buy things that makes you happy.Inner happiness.It is not that people tell youthat hey wow, look at Ankur Warikoo,what a rockstar he has become.No, because it is hollow.The same people would probablybe abusing you tomorrow.May be laughing at you.And nothing would have changed.You cannot controlwhat people think of you.You can only controlwhat you think of yourself.So definitely earn money.Absolutely spend the money.But on the things that make you happy.For example,there is a very simple rule in my life.There are only two uses of money,one is our convenience,our experiencesand the other is to help people.So, we spend our money on good travel,good food, stay in good hotels,fly good business class,experience good places,because it opens the mind.We get happiness.Our kids get to learn a lot.And that completes us.We don't spend on car,we don't spend on clothes,nor on unnecessary gadgets,unnecessary show off,those expensive sunglasses,those sneakers, all that, no.It is just simple,our money will be spenton our experiences.And then we spend money to help others.Because we like itwhen because of that moneypeople's lives can be changed.They can get education.They can get new opportunitiesand that is my use of money.I am not doing this to impress anyone.I am not doing this to show anyone.I am doing this only for myselfand when you earn money for yourself,spend money for yourself,there is never a better use of your money.Number 19:Buy health insurance as soon as possible.Health insurance is necessarybecause God forbid,if any hospitalization happensthen those medical billscan drain your entire savings.But buying early is importantbecause when you are young,your probability of hospitalizationis very low, so at a very good premium,at a low premium,gets you a good cover.Due to this,you will not be most likely hospitalized,so you will continue to getthe no-claim bonus.From that bonus,you will keep accruing benefits.And it will be becomea nice happy affair.So please buy health insuranceas soon as possible.It may happen that your companyhas already given youa corporate health insurance,in addition to that even buyyour own insurance.Why? Because the dayyou leave your company,that health insurance will lapse.All your no-claim bonuseswill be cancelled.And if you have any pre-existing disease,then its probation period there,the minimum amountafter which that pre-existing illnessis covered in your health insurance,starts from the beginning.You don't want that.So, buy a health insurancefor yourself as well.Buy as soon as possible.Number 20:When you buy health insurance,please don't involve your parents in it.A separate insurance for yourself.Why? Because as soon as your parentsbecome senior citizens and go above 60,their premium will spike enormously.And the premium for health insurancedepends on the oldest member of the group.So, if your mom or your dad there,they're an elder memberand they go above 60,and their premiums will spike up a lot,so even if you're 25, you'll unfortunatelybe paying a very high premium,to get the same cover.So, my suggestion, your,your immediate family,means spouse, your kids,separate health insurance for them.Your parents, only those two people,a separate insuranceand should be the smart wayof buying health insurance.Number 21:Never take a personal loan.I know that it can bean emergency, a necessity,and maybe at that point of timeyou cannot avoid it.But it would be unwiseif for buying somethingyou avail a personal loanor to impress someone,taking a personal loan.Or taking another loan to repay a loan.Personal loans are very expensive.14, 15, 16, 17 is 18%.And it is criminalto lend money at this rate to yourself.Please don't make this mistake.Number 22:This is very important point.Always try to calculatehow much money do you need in life?To do everything that you have to do.To everything that you want to do.You need money for your needs.You need money for your desires.Need money for future,you can calculate that every single thing,that how much does it result in.And the reason why this is importantis, because if you do not knowhow much money you are running after,then you will only keep runningafter money all your life.But the day you come to knowhow much money you need,you will have two lives.One which will be madein earning that moneyand the othermade in living after earning that money.And these are too very different lives.So, my suggestion, please calculatehow much money do you need in your lifeto live your life?I have made a video on this,that you can check outin the pinned comments and description.So that it helps youmake that calculation.Number 23:I wish someone had told methat money is not for buying things.Money gives freedom.Money doesn't get things,money gets freedom.What that means is,that the day you have money,you can do anything with your time.On that day, you can probablyalso push aside that job,which you were still using,to earn this money.On that day you can saythat I will go here, I will do thisand maybe that would again be work,but that work nowwill no longer be a compulsion,it will be your choice.And that is true value of money.Giving you freedom.Freedom from things.Freedom to do what you want to do.Here are 23 thingsI wish someone had told me in my 20s.I am telling all of you because in my 40s,I have experienced all these things.And now I very well knowthe importance of all these.I hope this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo,signing off.
