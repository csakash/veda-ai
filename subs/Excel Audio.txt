in lifethat I find it such a fascinating pieceof software.In this video, I want to sharetwo things with you.Number 1, how was my Excel journey?How did I reach this point whereI use Excel sheets for almostevery important life decision?And second, how can you use Excelto make money?5 side income options,whether you are a student, a freelancer,or a young working professional,if you know Excel

students,and this year, we are already on trackto hopefully touch â¹50 lakhs.All thanks to you!My Excel journey started very late.I am assuming that you are in your 20s.I explored Excel for the first timein my life at the age of 22 years.So in school and college,we used to work on computers,but that was an era, you are very young,you wouldn't even know thatthe computer labs in our schoolsif at all were very small,we had to take off her shoesto enter the lab,it was always air conditioned so that wasthe only room in the entire schoolwhere we used to enjoy cool airin the summers of Delhi,and one computer was sharedby three children.So it was literally likeif we had to write apple,I would press A, somebody would press P,someone else would press P, then L,and then E, and the group leader wouldpress enter because thatwould prove his worth.But that was the way we did it!Excel was a long way off,we used to play games,and do some things on the Word doc.And I remember when I went to the USfor the first timeas a Ph.D. student in 2002,I was 22 years old, and I took a classwhere a student had Excelopen on his computerand I had no idea what that was.It seemed like a very interestingchessboard-like software,and he wrote some numbers,whatever the numbers were,I don't even remember, 3, 4, 5, 6,whatever the case is,he wrote some 8 to 9 numbers together,and then at the end of it,he wrote equal to, sum, bracket open,he highlighted all the cells in whichhe wrote the numbers, and then he said,bracket close, and then he pressed enter.And the sum of all those numbers was shownin that cell,and it blew my mind!I was like, 'What just happened?!How did this happen?This is a calculator!'And he was like,'Yes, it's a calculator.'I said,'Oh, then why don't we usea calculator only?'And he said,'Because it is far better thana calculator!'And that was my introduction to Excel.I learned a lot about Excelin that one year,I made mistakes, there was no YouTubeat that time, and no online softwarewas available to study,there was no platform availablelike Udemy,everything was learned through books.We learned by making mistakes,and that's how the journeyactually started.So the first year, and then the 2nd year,I learned a bit,but it wasn't really professional.I had a fear of whetherI know it properly or not.And then, I went to ISB for my MBA,and there, I saw Excelat a very different level.Excel was used in accounting,data science, corporate finance,and statistics.Excel was being used in everything,and that's when I realizedthe power of this softwareand what it can accomplish.And then my first introductionto actually applying whateverI'd learned was after my ISBwhen I got my consulting job.If you are aware,consulting is almost always basedon Excel.All the presentations that you makeare based on your Excel dataand your Excel modeling.And a funny incident, my orientation.In the consulting firm that I joined,I guess around 12 people joined together,and one of them was quite well-builtand he used to model in the past.So our partners who were takingour orientation said,'How many of you have donemodeling before?'And of course, we hadn't done it,and that one guy raised his hand.And then the partner was like,'No, I am not talking about that modeling,I am talking about Excel modeling.'And then suddenly everybody raisedtheir hands because everybodyhad created models in excel for whatever,projects and other work.And that was when I realized thatall my learning about MS Excelis actually going to come to use,and it did.For the next three years,I applied so much of my Excel skillsto actual business problems.I was advising or consulting big companiesworth thousands of crores throughthe Excel sheet that I had made throughmy understanding of their businesswhich I was applying on to those models.Till today, I continue to use Excelfor almost every big decision of mine.Should I buy a house or take it on rent?Should I buy a car or take it on rent?Should I do 'pay now' or 'pay later'?Whether to pay off my loan or continue itand invest my money?All of those decisions which are usuallyguided by emotions,I start with an excel sheet,and that's what's helped me.What I also realized is that the worldhas changed so much thatthis Excel knowledge needn't be justfor your personal decisions.You can actually make moneywith your Excel knowledge.So the second part of this video is,if you know Excel properly,how can you make money through itas a student, as a freelancer,and as a young working professionalwith a side income becauseall of those optionsare now available for you?How to learn Exceland how to earn money through it,the best platform for that is Udemy.There are two courses aboutwhich I will speak,I have shared their linkin the pinned comment and description.Those two are the coursesthat I myself took when I was tryingto get on top of my Excel game,especially during my consulting days,and I have never looked back.Amazing courses about whichI'll tell you in a bit!Number 1:The job that you can go forif you know MS Excel.Investing.Investing not just for somebody elsebut for yourself too.Investing is usually a game of numbers,not emotions.It's not like,somebody sends an SMS saying,'Buy this stock my friend,and it will double up overnight.'No!It is a long-term play,especially if you invest in companiesthrough fundamental analysis.What are their fundamentals?What is their revenue growth,and profit growth?What is their return on equity?What is their debt-to-equity ratio?There are so many factorsthat come into play,and mostly all of them are doneon an excel sheet.Of course, there are graphs, views,and many candlestick charts,you may or may not have heardof all these terms,but you will be aware of them onceyou get into it, but the foundation ofall these is that you are comfortablewith numbers and you know how to playwith them which is done through Excel.A good example of that is wheneverI invest in stocks,though I do it very less,usually, I invest in portfolio stocks,but whenever I have to buy someselective stocks, then I often go toa platform that will have past research,and after applying all the filters likecompanies worth more than â¹2000 crores,they have been growing at a rate ofmore than 10% for the last 5 years,their profit is growing by 10%,their return on equity is more than 15%,whatever the case may be,I will filter filter filter,and I will get on 40-50 companies.I will download all the data on excel,and then I will actually play aroundwith that data to find out which arethe 4-5 stocks out of those 40-50 stockswhich I should buy,and a lot of investing methodsuse the same approach.So that's number 1, investing.Number 2: Digital marketing.Digital marketing is totally basedon numbers.Digital marketing is how your ads comeon digital platforms.You may be sick and tired ofwatching my ads,and all that machineryis digital marketing.By the way, sorry if you are fed upwith my ads.I wish I could control that,but as surprising as it may sound,I do not have that control,we are still trying to work withFacebook and Google to make that happen.Anyway, the art of selling your product,your service, or anything that you haveto do online is called digital marketing.Digital marketing is not an art,it is a science!A science that is absolutely basedon numbers, everything is measured.What is the click-through ratioon your ads?How many people click it and landon your landing page?What is your conversionon that landing page?How much have you paid to generatethat click?Have you paid at the level ofcost per click or cost per impressions?And all of that data is something thatis visible to you, is provided to you,and you have to then work throughthat to make sense of it.If you want to learn digital marketing,of course, there are a lot of courseson Udemy,but before that, you should be interestedin numbers, and that will happenthrough your understanding of MS Excel.On a weekly basis,I sit with my digital marketing agenciesand see all the numbers.We see those numbers in Excel itself.What is the performance of each coursein the last week?Comparing it with the previous weekand all the previous weeks.How is that movement happeningand measuring it?All of that is done throughan excel template which is beautifulbecause I get to see the power ofeverything that's happening,they get to track the numberson a daily and weekly basis,and we stay honest to that journey.So digital marketing is the second jobthat you can go for if you arean expert of MS Excel.I was going to use some other word,but I said 'expert'.Number 3: Social media Analytics.If you create content on social media,or you want to work with a personwho creates content,then there are a lot of content creatorsand personal brands,they all need an analytics person.A person who can tell themwhat is happening on their platformevery week?What happened on LinkedIn, Twitter,and Instagram?How did the Reels, posts,and stories perform?What happened on YouTube?What was the average video duration?What was the CTR or click-through rateon the thumbnail?How much was the retention of people?Where did the people come from?From which platform did they see?All of that is just data and that dataneeds to be understood.Because you can get the data easily,but taking out insightfrom that data is what is the art ofthe social media analytics person.I remember way back in,I think October 2020,2 years back, we hired someone in our teamby the name of Shaurya who took upthe role of analytics in the team.Today he looks after the analyticsof all the platforms.He started with YouTube.Today he looks after LinkedIn, Instagram,and of course YouTube, plus any appthat is getting built.All of that is powerful,because I think I was one ofthe few content creators in the countrywho built a team for content, thumbnails,video editor, and graphic designer,along with all these people I hiredan analytics person also.And today most content creatorsare either working with oneor feel the need for one.So if you are interested in dataand you know MS Excel properly,then a social media analytics guycould be something that you go for.Number 4: Product Analytics.There are a lot of apps which we all use.Those apps could be at a very large scalelike WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Instagram,Twitter, or YouTube, or they could beat a small scale as well like appscreated by startups.A measurement of all these appsis very important which comes ona dashboard that comes on the backend.So the owner of the app knowshow many users are logging in,for how long, from where,at what speed, using which phone,what are they clicking,where are they spending more time,and what is their movement.All of that is called Product Analytics.A role where if you are aware of data,love MS Excel, and of course,love products and technologies,then you combine these 3 skills of yoursand you convert this into this rolewhere you can draw insights from data.You can tell somebody,I can clearly see that people fromSouth India who log in at 9 p.m.tend to spend a lot more time on the appas against if they log in at 11 a.m.So there is a propensity of this regionwith this time, and there is somethingthat is happening on the appduring this time that makes it work,and then you go deeper.This is just an example of whata product analytics guy could doif you are interested in these 3 things.Of course, starting with your lovefor numbers and your proficiencywith MS Excel.And then finally, role number 5:Data entry.A very basic role but a role whichalmost every business needs.If you go by logic,then Excel is a software that is usedin almost every business,no matter how small it isor surprisingly, how big it is.And data entry is a role that becomesreally important there.That data could be of any form.It could be customer data, finance data,marketing data, or HR data, in any form,they need people who can enterthat data accurately and error-free,and maintain and update it.And all of that isa wonderful job opportunity,especially for people who do not wantto work from office,they want to work from homeand have flexible hours,because it doesn't need anything to bedone in real-time, what is required isthat you should know all the formulasof Excel so that you can quicklydo that data entry.If I ask you to send an email toall the Ankurs in a sheet,and you will look for each and every Ankurone by one,then it will eat up all your timeand you won't be able to do it,but if you knew that there is actuallya way in MS Excel to find outwhich cell has Ankur in it or not,and if it does then what needs to be done,then your work can be done in no time,and you will be faster with your work,more productive with your work,get paid the same,and your company loves youfor what you do.So if you love data, and know MS Excel,you can pick up these five jobsas a student, as a freelancer,as a young working professionalto add to your income,and of course, your experience becauseit is obvious that if you like dataand you are expert in a softwarelike Excel,then you are only going to benefitfrom that in the future.Data is the biggest thing that will drivethe world going forward.Ok finally.I've told you that it is importantto know MS Excelbut where should you learn it from?As I said, there are amazing courseson Udemy.Two of these courses that I want to sharewith you are:The first one and my favorite whichI personally learned I thinkin about 2008,Microsoft Excel -Excel from Beginner to Advanced.It's a great course!More than 11 lakh students have takenthis course.It is a very highly rated course, 4.7,and you will see that it has everythingimportant for you to know.An introduction, after that,an intermediate level,then an advanced level, and of course,if you want to know a lot,then Macros and VBA, all of those thingsare available in there.It has amazing reviews and ratings,so clearly you will benefit from a coursewhere a lot of students learned a lot,and I am sure you will learn too.The other course is,Microsoft Excel-Advanced Excel Formulas & Functions.It is specific.Not just Excel, if you know some basics,and you don't want to take the coursethat I shared earlier, then you can takethis course at an advanced level,which specifically talks aboutadvanced formulas and advanced functions.Again, more than 3 lakh studentshave taken this course.4.6 rated,so very very highly rated on Udemy.And you will see that it containsliterally everything that you wouldwant to know from an advanced level.A few things likethe dynamic array formula,if you don't know about it,will blow your mind when you will learnthe array formula!Like I remember the first time,I think in 2007,I used the array formula forthe first time in my lifewhich my colleague taught me,and as I used it, the work which usedto take me hours was donein literally two seconds,because I found a way of usingarrays in Excel.Just a simple example ofhow you can give importance to your time,and increase the experience of your workwithout spending as much timeas you used to in the past.All thanks to something like Excel!The link to these two courses is therein the pinned comment and description.As I said, if you click on themand buy them, I earn an affiliate

my hope is thatwe'll be able to spend â¹50 lakhs this yeartowards the education of students.All thanks to you!I hope this was useful.I genuinely hope that you also sharethe love I have for MS Excel,and if you can benefit from whatI have learned through these yearswith the love of Excel,then I'd consider this a wonderful video.Thank you so much!I hope this video was useful.I hope that the love I have for MS Excelshines in your life as well.If it does, I would be super happy!Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
