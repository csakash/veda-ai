What type of mutual fundsare there and how to choose them,we will get to know in this video.Friends, 2022 has startedin a very different way,especially when it comesto the stock market.There is a lot of troublein the market, and a lot of peopleare scared because,for a lot of you,this is the first downturnthat you have ever seen.Obviously, you don't understandhow to manage your money.A lot of people are moving towards FD.No!But in this video,I want to try to show you,why long-term investingin the stock market is a great idea.Hopefully, you know this,but you are not very sureof what to do about it.The best way to enter the stock market,is not by picking up stocks,which you think will makeyou rich overnight,but instead to be very disciplinedabout investing, and investin a portfolio of stocks.I have often spoken aboutsmallcase, mutual funds,and this video is specificallyabout mutual funds.Not something that I personally do,but I definitely feel it can bea great start for somebodywho is scared right now,or somebody who does not knowhow to think about long-term investingwhen it comes to mutual funds.In this video, we will tryto answer 4 questions.Number 1: Irrespective ofwhat age you are,if you want to start yourequity investing,then what percentage ofyour monthly income shouldgo towards equity,and what should gointo safer assets?Number 2: What role do mutual fundsplay in that equity?Why are they important?Why are they better,in my opinion, than picking up stocks?Number 3: How to select mutual funds?This is the bulk of the conversationin this video,basis two important thingsabout which I will talklater on in the video.And Number 4: Whenever youconsider a mutual fund,then which cost implicationsdo you have to keep in mind,so that you are fully aware ofwhere your money is going?Let's get started withthe first question.If you want to start yourequity investing journey,and if you are sick and tiredof doing FDs,or you are scared of FDsbecause of what I say,then what should be the split?There is a very nice rule for this,which is called the 100 minus X rule.According to it, if your age is X,let's say it's 25 years,then 100 minus X which is 75,should be in percentage termswhat you would invest in equities,and the reamining would bein safer assets which could befixed income assets.All these things are coveredby the mutual fund as well,but if I were to answerthat question at one point,then if your age is X,then X percentage of yourmonthly investment should gointo fixed income or safe assets,and then 100 minus X percent should gointo the equities.This is all long-term.Now where does mutual fundfit in all this?What is mutual fund?A mutual fund is basicallya portfolio of stocks that aremanaged by somebody else.You are not an expert,I am not an expert,so I would never suggest youto buy any particular stock,because I don't do thatpersonally myself.I always rely on experts.People whose 24/7 jobis to research equities,read their balance sheets,read their financial statements,research their companies,and then figure out which one canmake good returns for their customers.Now mutual funds allow youto buy into a certain idea,just as in smallcase.Smallcase says, if you believein middle-class India,then here are the companiesthat are investing in middle-class,you can invest in them.If you trust rural India,then here are the companiesthat will drive growth fromthe growth of rural India.If you believe in Tata Group,then here are all the Tata group companiesin which you can invest.And there are experts on smallcasewho are running these smallcases,which I have personally subscribed to.Mutual funds are a lot simpler.Mutual funds say that the ideasmay be lesser, but there are themes.You can investin the total stock market,you can invest only in debt,you can invest only in large companies,you can invest onlyin mid-size companies,so on and so forth.So it gives you a lot of flexibilitybut at a high level,and we want to drive that.That brings a questionwhat is the difference betweenmutual funds and stocks?If someone says if I have boughtthese 5 stocks,then I can easily buy those5 stocks themselves,why should I buy a mutual fund?Three reasons.Number 1: Fractional ownership.If you want to buy the stocksof 5 companies,and if you buy each stock one by one,then you will have to paythe minimum stock pricefor each one of them,which would amount toa large sum of money.But mutual funds buy those stocks,and you buy units of mutual funds,and that could beas low as â¹500 a month.So you get the ownershipof these companies in â¹500,which you cannot get directlythrough stocks,because India does not allowpiecemeal ownership of a stock,you will have to buy at leastone stock of a company,unlike in the US.That is the first benefit.The second benefit is somethingcalled rebalancing.Since there is a fund manager,and their only job is to managethis mutual fund,then they are actively rebalancingthis mutual fund,which means they are keeping it updated.If a company is not performing well,they would sell it or reduce it,if a company is doing really well,then they will increase itor introduce it,you and I cannot do all these things,neither do we have the timenor the expertise,but somebody else is doing that 24/7,and we can ride on that benefit.And number 3: Based on this,the research.That research is immensely precious.Yes, we have to bear the cost for it,which I will try to answerin the last question,but in my opinion,that is a very small costfor somebody else doingthe hard work for you,and you are riding on theirexpertise and performance.Now let's come to the thirdand the most important questionfor this video,how to select a mutual fund?I will not tell you whichmutual fund should you select,because that becomes trickier,I will tell you which typeof mutual fund should you select.First of all, what are thetypes of mutual funds?Fundamentally, there are three.The first mutual fund is calleda debt mutual fund.What is a debt mutual fund?It's very similar to FD.This mutual fund will investin those assets where we geta fixed rate of return.These are largely corporate bonds,government bonds,it could be FDs as well,and anything that is guaranteeinga fixed rate of return.So the benefit of that isif you invest in this mutual fund,then on average, you geta very straight fixed rate of return.It is never equal and exact to FD,but it moves in a very tight reach,and I will show you the graphto establish that for you.The second is called equityor growth mutual funds.These mutual funds investin equities or the stock market,so it doesn't have the instrumentsor assets of fixed incomeor fixed rate of return.And then naturallyif these two exist,then the third,which is a combination of these twoalso exists,usually called a hybridor balanced mutual fund.These mutual funds havesome amount of fixed incomeand some amount of equity and stock,and the ratio of thatis determined by your risk appetite.So let's say you are 25 years old,and you want a mutual fundwhich invests 25% in debtor fixed rate of return,and 75% in equities,then a mutual fundthat does precisely that,is what you would want.But there are a lot of nuancesin between as well,especially in equities.When I say that invest in equities,what actually do you have to invest in?Do you have to invest inReliance or Tata,or some random Warikoo Fertilizeror Warikoo Chemical companythat has been launched,whose stock price is growing rapidly?Should you invest in pharmaor banking or Telecom?So all of these are stilldecisions that we struggle to take,and I've created a very simplemethod mental model for this,which is right now on your screen.So imagine a square thathas nine equal sections.Three sections on the x-axisand three sections on the y-axis.The question on the x-axis is,for how long are you investing?Is it short-term?And in my definition,the short term means anythingless than 2 years.Is it mid-term,which is between 2 to 5 years?Or is it long-term,which is greater than 5 years?Usually, these three areour investment horizons.And then the question on the y axis ishow much rest are you ready to take?Low risk, medium risk, or high risk?Now when I say high risk,it doesn't mean you will not go for it.It means you will invest inhigh risk for a small amount,but you will surely go for it,because it may servea higher returnover a long period of time.How?Let's get to know.Now we have these nine sections,which means nine different typesof approaches dependingon where you are.Suppose you want to investfor greater than 5 years,and that is a question you askwhere should you invest?For greater than 5 years,the low-risk category investmentshould be what is calledlarge-cap mutual funds.These are mutual fundsthat invest in equities only,and there too only in thosecompanies which are large sized.Reliance, Tata, Infosys, Wipro,Asian Paints, are the usual suspects.Why are they low risk?They are low risk becausethese companies are provenin terms of their track record,they are growing efficientlyin the last several years,their corporate structureis very well established,management is quite stable,and the fund managerwho is managing this,is going to ensure yourthat these companies will notshake overnight, because frankly,nothing happens to thesecompanies overnight.So you are taking a considerablylower risk over a long-term periodby investing in large-cap mutual funds.What is a medium risk in long term?Mid Cap mutual funds.Those companies whose size,which is called market capitalizationor the size of the company,is somewhere in the middle.They are not large but they havebecome larger than small,that is where you would invest.Why is the risk greater in this?Because it is possible thatthe company shuts down,or a company grows slowly,or a company goes through distress,and all of that will be managedby the mutual fund,but it is possible thatthe dip or the declineat that point in time,that could be harder.However over a long period of time,this is proven to give higher returns,and I will show thisto you in a graph.And then at the last,if you want to take high riskfor the long term,then why should you invest?And that is somethingcalled small-cap mutual funds.Those companies whichare very small right now,you are investing in equities only,and since they are very small,anything can happen to them.So that's why very high risk,but because of that high risk,you may, just may earn high returns.So let's look at the comparisonof these three for a mutual fund.I have chosen HDFC,it is not a recommendation,I have not invested in thismutual fund personally,so it is not a recommendation,only for comparison,I am showing you the performanceof the large-cap, mid-cap,and small-cap mutual funds of HDFC.For the comparison ofthese mutual funds,I'm using Coin by Zerodha,which is the app that I usefor my mutual funds.Again, not a recommendation,you can use any appas long as it is free,which means direct,and we will come to that later.So, when you see this graph,I have compared three mutual funds,the HDFC index Nifty 50,which is a mutual fundthat invests in the top 50 stocksof the National Stock Exchange,so this is a large-cap.Then HDFC mid-cap and HDFC small-cap.When you see here,you can see the differencein how they have performed,in fact, you can see thatsmall and midcap have givenbetter returns than large-cap.So if you look at the 3-year returnthen 11.68% is the large-cap return,16.85% is midcap,and 16.77% is small-cap.Hey, if it is so much thenwhy wouldn't I invest inmid and small-cap itself?Because of the risk.Here is how it works.Look at every decline.Look at this decline,let me try to zoom in, ok.If you look at this decline,when large-cap declined,it went from here to here,so the NAV was around 200,let's say the stock price ofthat mutual fund,so it went to about 180.But small and mid-cap,declined rapidly.So small-cap or mid-capwas for 325, and it wentall the way down to 280,so in the terms of percentageit was a steeper decline,and that was true for any decline.Look at this decline in 2020which happened because of covid.Large-cap went from216 to say about 154,and the red one,which is the small-cap,sorry mid-cap, went from 316to all the way to 204.So it lost almost one-thirdor 33% of its value,whereas here it only lost about...And that is what is meant by risk,that when it declines,does it decline rapidly or not?Anything that is low riskwill decline lesser than anythingthat is high risk,and that is not somethingthat you may want for yourself.Then let's look at the midterm.In a midterm, you invest yourmoney for 2-5 years,and you are looking atwhat should be the mutual fundsthat cover low risk, medium risk,and high risk.In low risk, you would gofor something calleda balanced large-cap mutual fund.This means a mutual fundthat invests in fixed incomeas well as equities,but when it comes to equities,then it invests only inlarge-capital companies.So you are getting the stabilityof equities because it is low risk,and you are also getting fixed income,which is the combination thereof.For medium risk, similarly,you can invest in a hybrid large-cap,or a balanced large cap,both are the same,So medium and low riskare broadly the same.And then in high risk,you will take multi-cap funds.Multi-cap funds are thosewhich invest in equity,but across all types of companies,large, medium, and small,and that's why they are high risk,because the full investmentis in equities,and there is no fixed income.So it is possible that in 2-5 years,and it has happened a number of times,the equity market has not performed.So it is quite possiblethat in those 2-5 years,you invested in equities only,but your money did not move at all,it just kept moving sideways,0-1-2-4%, or you gotlesser returns than FD,and that is not somethingthat you would want,so that is why it is high risk.And then finally short-term.If you want to invest your moneyfor a short term whichis less than 2 years,then ideally, you should notinvest in equities,because over a 2-year period,equities can go anywhere,and you cannot play with your money,that is not wise investing.So the mutual funds which wouldbe for less than 2 years,would be mostly liquidor fixed income mutual funds.What are these mutual funds?These are the mutual fundsthat invest in a fixed rate of return,whether it is government bonds,or corporate bonds, or FDs, etc.,and that is why they ensurea stable return over a period of time.This fluctuation that you seehere in this graph,it will not be there.For example, if you lookat HDFC liquid fund,then the liquid fund isthe best place to park your money,if you want a stable incomefor a short term.See this graph,this graph is almost straight,there is no up and down.If you see the 1-year return,3-year return, 5-year return,it's broadly the same,3 to 5%, which is almostwhat FD will give you,nothing which issignificantly different,so you will park your money hereonly and only because you areinvesting for short period.So for short-term and low-risk,the best option is a debt mutual fund.For short-term and medium risk,it will be a liquid fund.And for short-term and high risk,you are ready to take high riskin a short term too,that will be a hybrid fund,where it would mostly be debt,but some percentage can be equity,because you are willingto take that high risk.So this is the total graph.And that is how you would goabout picking your mutual funds.Now the question is,what is my risk?Ideally, and this iscompletely driven by,I don't know who you are,I don't know what's yourrisk appetite,but if you would askfor my recommendation,if you are spending â¹100,then should you putall that money in low risk,or all of it in high risk?The answer is no.You should followa combination approach.My suggestion isthat you should invest 70%,or â¹70 from â¹100 in low risk,25% in medium risk,and 5% in high risk.This means if you are investingfor a long term,which is greater than 5 years,then put 70% of that moneyin large-cap mutual funds,25% of that money inmid-cap mutual funds,and then 5% of that moneyin small-cap mutual funds.Similarly for any othertime horizon.This will then tell youwhat will be a nice happy mix,where you will get good returns,and you would not take morethan the necessary riskfor that time period.Finally the question of cost.If some other person is doingall this work for you,how much do you have to pay?Essentially, there are two costs.One, which is calledthe expense ratio,and two, which is calledthe exit load.Whenever you look at any stock,for example, I am lookingat the HDFC hybrid equity fund.What is a hybrid?It has debt it as well as equity.You will see that the expense ratiois 1.1%, which meansif you are investing â¹1 lakh,then 1.1% of it,which is around â¹1,100,will be used as an expense ratioto manage that fund.These â¹1,100 are used to supportthe management of the whole fund.If you buy through a platformlike Coin, then your expense ratiois lesser,because you are buying directlyfrom the mutual fund.There is also somethingcalled regular mutual funds,where you buy through an agentor commission,which is usuallywhat our parents used to do,where the expense ratios are higher,because the commissionof those agents is addedto that expense ratio.So please, as smart investors,only and only buy direct mutual funds,not regular mutual funds,and these platformswhich are largely onlinewill allow you to do that.The second cost is what's calledan exit load.Exit load means whenever you exitfrom this mutual fund,you will have to bear a cost,and this is anywhere between 0-1%.As it is written here,for units in excess of15% of the investment,1% will be charged forredemption within one year.This means, if you havepurchased 100 units,and you sell more than15 units within a year,then you will have to pay 1%,if you sell less than 15,then nothing at all,if you sell after one year,again nothing at all,which is a great place to bebecause you are as it isinvesting for the long term.Exit loads are very importantin a short term.That's why if you lookat the liquid funds,since they are largely usedfor the short term,their exit load is very low, 0.007%.And that means if you are buyinga liquid fund, and selling it,you will have to pay 0.007% only,that too if you take it within two days,if you sell the mutual fundafter 7 days,then you will not haveto bear any exit load,which is exactly how theseliquid funds are designed.So this is the cost structureof mutual funds.Through these four questions,How much to invest in a mutual fund?How are mutual funds differentfrom buying stocks?What should be the approachfor you to considerwhat kind of mutual funds to buy?And finally, what arethe cost implications of buyinga mutual fund?That completes the entire picture.Yes, one thing is left,which is the tax implications.Mutual funds performexactly like stocks.There is a long-termand short-term capital gain tax on them.If you buy and sell a mutual fundwithin 1 year,then it is a short-term capital gain tax,which is 15%.If you sell after 1 year,then it is 10%,which is a long-term capital gain tax.This is the complete pictureof mutual funds.Please get started,and get started ina disciplined fashion.You will not regret thisfor the rest of your life.I know so many people who starttheir mutual fund orstock investing journey early in life,and then by the time they are 30-35,they are sitting on so much cashthat most others cannot even imagine.And there are so many peoplewho could do it, but they didn't,and then at the age of 30-35-40,they are sitting withfamily responsibilities,children's expenses,household expenses, and so on,they are regretting that theydon't have any investment corpus,and they have to now see20 more years of workingbefore they get theirfinancial independence.I wouldn't want anyone of youto be that person.On that note, Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
