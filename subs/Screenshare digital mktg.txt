For example, as you can see on the screen,this is the landing pagefor my time management course calledTake Charge Of Your Time.I am not promoting this coursein this video,so there will be nothing about this coursein the pinned comment or the description,but I just want to show youhow this actually works.So you will see all the details like,what will you get in this course,about me,who can take this course,so you can be an entrepreneur,a working professional,a freelancer, a student,you will get a certificateonce you complete the course,there are testimonials that will tell youthat these students have taken this courseand they are really excited about it,there are loads of testimonials,there's a no question asked refund policy,frequently asked questions,and at every point in time, the CTA is'BUY NOW'.Let's see how many times'BUY NOW' appears.You will see this is the third time,fourth time, fifth time, sixth time,so this 'BUY NOW' keeps coming upbecause that is the final actionthat I want everyone to take.So by combining these four things,who is the audience,what do you want to tell them,what do you want to get done,and how to achieve that through the page,this is how the digital marketing processworks.And finally, how do you pay?So Google and Facebookor any such digital advertisercharge on largely two bases.Something called CPM or CPC.CPM means if someone will see your ada thousand times,then how much money will you pay for it?Cost per thousand Impressions.It varies in India basiswhat kind of audience have you selected,on which platform are you doing it,at what time, daytime or evening,which week of the month are you doing it,which month of the year are you doing it,it completely varies.But to give you a sense,it could be anywhere betweenâ¹50 to â¹300-400, even higher.So that means when someone will see thisad of yours a thousand times,you will have to pay â¹50, or â¹100,or â¹200 for it.There is another thing called CPC.Meaning, every time you show an ad,we will not charge for it,and you will not pay any moneyuntil someone clicks.If someone clicks, i.e. cost per click,then you have to pay whatever the CPC is.Again, CPC varies a lot.It could be as low as â¹3-4 toas high as â¹20-30 dependingon what kind of audience you want to haveand which text or keyword do you wantto have their interest in,and that could be in high demand.For example,if you want to sell car insurance,and car insurance is very competitive,a lot of people want tosell car insurance,so if you go on Googleand type car insurance,you will see a lot of ads.If someone clicks on any of those ads,then naturally it isa very valuable click,because somebody is searchingfor car insurance,so that cost could be very high.But if you search forWarikoo YouTube videos,then nobody is trying to sell somethingon Warikoo YouTube videos,so if you run an ad on that,its CPC would be very less becausecompetition is very less,frequency or the scale of searchesis very less, and so on.And that is how all of this comesinto place.All this may seem to be intimidatingand overwhelming, but trust me,it is a very simple and beautiful science,and if you learn it,you will not just help your business,whether it is freelancing,whether it is actually your startup,you will also be prepared for the future,because digital marketing is onlygoing to get bigger in the future.Every single one of us,most of our time is spenton digital products,and through that digital product,we are becoming aware of newerdigital products and services.Once you understand digital marketing,then you will know how to captivatethe attention of the peopleand audiences at large.As I said, there are amazing coursesavailable by Udemy, which run coursesthrough globally well-recognizedpractitioners and professionals,and you will get them atvery attractive prices,and I will show you a few courseswhich are my personal favoritewhen I started my journey.Now to show you actual data,how it works,and the magic of it all,look at the screen.As you can see on the screen,this is the daily record of my spends,its performance, and how we break downits performance.For example,I'm showing you October's data,and let's pick a date in October,let's pick 17th October.We spent â¹2,32,000 on 17th October on ads,and we made 502 sales.These 502 sales were atapproximately â¹579.How?It is 232 divided by 502.So what is our cost per action?579.Now at the cost of this 232,we earned â¹2,93,000,which is a profit ofâ¹61,000 approximately,and that came at a very low ROASor Return On Ad Spend of only 1.26,i.e by spending â¹1 we got â¹1.26 back.If we look at the previous date,16th October, by spending â¹1 we got â¹1.66,and we made a profit of â¹1,50,000.If we look at the next date,ROAS is 1.5,and we made a profit of â¹93,000.If we look at the whole month,we spend around â¹55 lakhs,we generated sales of â¹85 lakhs,and our net profit was around â¹31 lakhsat an ROAS of 1.56.This ROAS does not coverthe organic sales,those are the sales when people directlygo to your site and buy something,that is additional to all of this,this is only the digital marketing spend.There is a further breakdownof all this among all the courses,and you will seehow all of this data translates.But the best part, these are basedon each course also.So if I were to show you,this is only for time management.If we got on 17th October,out of â¹2,32,000,we spent â¹2,04,000 just on time management.There were 463 sales, the approximate valueof every sale was â¹523, we earned â¹2,20,000,and the profit was â¹16,000which is really really low.On the previous day,we made a profit of â¹87,000,and on the next day, we made a profit of â¹50,000,and then there is a breakup,like which were the live sales,i.e. the courses which come with live classes,the option which doesn't comewith live classes, so on and so forth.And the same thing is also donefor every single platform,Facebook, Google, and so on.For example, if I look at Facebook only,on 17th October, we spent almost â¹85,000on Facebook, we got 198 sales at â¹614,and earned â¹76,000,which means we lost â¹8,500 on Facebookon that day.But if I see the same thing on Google,on 17th October, we spent â¹1,19,000,we got 265 sales, we earned â¹1,44,000,so we made a net profit of â¹25,000,and then of course a lot of data.You will see, all of this is massive data.How much was the CPM on 17th October?The CPM on 17th October was around â¹100,which means on every 1000 timeswhen this ad was shown, we paid Google â¹100.On those 1000 times, we got 0.57% clicks,which means when people saw that ad 1000 times,then 0.57 is 57 times.Is it 57?No, that would be 5.7%.Sorry, just a second.1% of 1,000 is 10, correct, right?10% of 1,000 is 100, 1% of 1,000 is 10, so 5.7.Ok.CTR i.e. Click Through Ratio,how many times did people clickon all the impressions?That was 0.57%.This means if people saw the ada thousand times,then 5.7 times people clicked on it,so there are a lot of peoplewho did not click on the ad,and that is always the case.CTR is always between 1-2%.And then there were views,the conversion on those views,and then finally the conversion ratiofrom the conversion is 3.62%,which means the total number of peoplewho clicked on that ad,3.62% of those people actually bought it.All of this data is something thatGoogle and Facebook will give you,and then we recorded it on the Google sheetso that we can analyze all of this,but the larger thing is digital marketingis a way where you have all of this datain front of you.If you want to get into any detailand find out which ad is doing well,which audience is doing well,which platform is doing well and at what time,which landing page is doing well,all that data is available for you,but to master that,you need to then have the right credentials.And for that, Udemy.I have often spoken about the courses on Udemy.It is one of the best platformsif not the best platform to learnfrankly anything,because this is taught by the best practitionersin the world.My favorite digital marketing courseon Udemy is,The Complete Digital Marketing Course-12 Courses in 1.You

actually already see results,which is brilliant.That's the best thing you would wantfrom a course.And then finally,The Ultimate SEO Training 2022and SEO For Wordpress Websites.Why?As I said, you have digital marketingwhich is a great channel,but there would be an organic one also.For example, people watch a lot of your ads,then they search on Google about youbecause they have forgottenwhere they saw that ad, and so on.Now when they search,you want to be ranked number one,and knowing SEO for that is very important.For example, if you search forWarikoo time management,then my website comes on the topwith the course link,and that becomes an organic salethat I want to capture.It's a 7.5-hour course.Again something that a lot of peoplehave raved about.If you see the reviews,the course is informative and easily digestible.Just completed the course,this instructor is one of the bestyou will find online.And that's the best thing about Udemy,a lot of people only talk aboutthe instructors

these 3 courses.Digital marketing which is 12 courses in 1,Instagram marketing specifically for Instagram,and then the ultimate SEO training 2022.The links for these three courses arein the pinned comment and the description,and the best part,November 18th to November 28th,the black Friday sale would be on Udemywhich means all of these courseswill come to you at insanely attractive priceswhere
