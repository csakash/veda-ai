Awesome.I will very quickly give an intro.It'll be in Hindi,but let that not derail you.We can have the conversationcompletely in English as well.Okay. Yeah, sure.Okay.Today, I have with me,the co-founder of Zerodha and CEO,Nithin Kamath.Welcome to the show, Nithin.Thanks, Ankur.Thanks for having me on this.Thank you so much, man.It's been a pleasure connecting with youafter several yearsand of course, in that time period,I've become a bigger and biggerand bigger fan of what you've built.Thank you for doing all thatyou and your team does.It is such a massive differencethat is being created in this countryand hopefully for several years to come.So, I'm super excitedto have this conversation with you.Thanks. Thanks for the kind words.Awesome.So, the format is very simple,Twenty questions.And these are not rapid fires.You can take your time to answer themand you get a maximum of three skips.So, at any point of time,you choose not to answer a question,feel free not to,but maximum of three.Sounds good?Got it.Perfect. Let's get started.The number one question, Nithin,what's the biggest changeyou have seen in yourselfin the last 10 years?10 years. Okay.So, so I, I think,I, I started trading very early,and so, and trading,for the material goals, right?As in,there was a certain watch I wanted to buy.A certain car.So, if you went back to my bedroomwhen I was 16,it was just all the material thingsI wanted to buy,and these were my goals in my life.So, I think, I think,now compared to 10 years back,I kind of realizedthat those material goalsdon't really bring you happiness,you know, so and, but, but you know,it'll be hypocrisy if I didn't saythat you can say it,only once you make the money.[both laugh]but now I've kind of realizedthat incrementally after a certain point,money doesn't really have much.And so, so I think,I don't care about material stuff anymoreand that's probably,the biggest change in me.So now I get more excitedin terms of the impactof what I'm doing versus the upside,in terms of whatever moneyyou can make, make out of it.So, so that's--that's really the biggest change, I think.Yeah. No, that it's so true.I, I, as you were giving this answer,I was reminded of a beautiful quoteby Jim Carrey who says,âI wish everyone in the worldgot all the money and the famethat they wanted, so that they know that,that's not the answer.âAnd, it's only once you have all of thatand I've seen that side of yours as well,even in your conversations early onwhere you were going after those thingsand you loved your watchesand you loved your cars,and once you have themyou realize it's,it's possibly not the dent that I thought.Awesome. Wonderful.If not Zerodha than what?What would,what do you think you would be doing?Yeah, again, I think I got extremely luckyfinding something that I love quite early,trading, stock markets.It was passion, love,so it never felt like work,the last 25 years or so.So, I think I would've done somethingaround not stock markets.So, if not a broker,I mean, like Nikhil, my younger brothermaybe manage money,trade it, hedge fund, training, educating,maybe somethinglike what you are trying to do,but more focusing, focusing on markets.Yeah. But, but I'm sureI would've stuck around,doing something around capital marketsbecause, I keep joking with the teamsaying I'm like one of thoseone-trick poniesâ types,so like the only thing that I know,know well in my life is stock markets.So, I would have definitelydone something around this.Awesome.Next question,which is kind of a follow on.Do you believe in real estate at allas an investment, asset?I mean, I mean,I have a very pessimistic viewon, on real estate.I think, I think,no, personally I hold real estates,I mean, I think everyone needs a house.It kind of more than it--more than that being an asset class,I think it just gives youa sense of security,which is very important for everyone,because, but--but is it a, is it a good investment?I'm not really sure. I think,I think the last 15, 20 years of the worldhas been fueled by cheap money,so, which has meant that asset priceshave gone up, because it's been fundedwith very low cost kind of fundsand, if not for that,if you were to really question,what do you really getfor the, for the money you are payingto own real estate,in this country, right?I mean, for a site that you, you know,for buying like,one of those 50, 80 kinds of sitesin Bangalore, you could potentially go buya village in Spain, right?And, so yeah,so I think, I think the public infra,the public utilities,the pollution,the city is choking.So, I think I don't, I don't really,I don't see value in real estate,because I thinkyou don't really get back anythingfor all the money that you're payingfor a real estate,so everything that we own as a businessis, I mean,we don't own any real estateas a business, everything is rented.Because, one is, once you own something,it's like getting married to it,so then,so, so we've always rented stuff,it's good in terms of tax efficiency.If I look back in time,even if I had boughtthe places where we rented,we would've lost moneyover the last 10, 12 years.Wow.So it's, becausethe price of the property hasn't gone upas much as, the money in the bank, right?Yeah.So, yeah. So it's,I think, but, but like I said,that said, owning one piece of,like a home.Itâs just incredible, the amountof security that brings along.I still remember the first time,I ended up buying the apartment,It just,It just felt so much more,the mind was so much more at peace.So I think, I think everyone needs a home,but I'm not sureabout real estate as an investment.Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. I do,I do remember your Twitter thread on this,on the same lines,which just struck a chord,I completely endorse your point of view,so I would agree. Awesome.What, what, what's the most undesirablepart of your day?Well, I was just, I was just,talking about this yesterday, actually,with, with a bunch of friends as well.So, the first,I used to be very activeon a lot of these online communitiesaround trading and markets before Zerodha,like today, what you call influencers,I was, maybe,one of the original influencers,in this country.But I was doing it all in my pseudo name,I was not Nithin Kamath.I was--I had like different personason different platformsand it helped significantlywhen we started Zerodhabecause, I could easily kind of--it was almost like a guerrilla marketingstrategy of sorts.I could plug in Zerodhaonto these forums, very easily.And, and I had like a track recordof 10 years almost on being on these,Yahoo messenger groupsand Orkut, and et cetera.But once Zerodha started,I think around, 2011, 2012,we got our first feature in a newspaper,Economic Times, featured usin 2011, September.And, and I suddenly saw a lot of businessactually going up because of that.Because in the business of money,credibility is importantand what press says, brings credibility.So, between 2011 to 2017-18,I think I spent at least 2-3 hoursevery day speaking to journalists.Just to try to get featuresand mentions and et cetera,because it brought credibilityto the business.And it was essentially the same thingI kept saying over and over again.I mean, I was, at one pointI was such, so much in trancethat every conversationwas essentially the same,I could do math while talking to someone,in my head.Right? So,So yeah, that was a hard part of my job,talking same thing,because there was--there is nothing different,every single conversationpeople wanted to know what is Zerodha,the background of Zerodha.how did we get to wherever we did?And the story doesn't change.I mean, from one time to another.And so, I found that really hard.And then--but around 2017-18 is when I realizedthat the power of the press was waning,Yeah.and social media was taking over.I was kind of late to this whole party.So, I went live,I mean, I started posting stuffonly on Twitter and LinkedIn,I think in 2019,some time around there.And then, I find it extremely hard,I mean, I--this whole, being on social media,being judged constantly,and this whole,the dopamine rush you getevery time you share somethingand how do you stay in control.It's very addictive,it's very, I mean--I've seen really smart guys break apartbeing on social media.But the unfortunate bit today is thatyou cannot, not be on it as well, right?Because you need to be in controlof your narrative.You canât now rely on traditional media,to kind of help build credibility.So, yeah, so I mean,I have a bunch of checks and balancesin place in the office.I have a bunch of guys to tell mewhen I'm doing any stupidity,so, I can also--but find it really hard, this isâ¦I'm interested to know,do you have to vet your tweets.Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.By a legal team. I would imagine so.No, not legal.Not by a legal team.Yeah, no, I've said,I have these 2-3 people in the office,whom I have said, you cannot--if you let me say something stupidthe onus is on you.And so I--There are times when,because the problem, I think,with social media is that,you know that the way to get engagementis to say more, right?But saying more is so hard.I mean, how do you manufacture content?and then, suddenly there'll be timesthat I see tweets everywhere.I'm like, dude,no, I need to shut this thing.So now, I have a 15-minute timeron my, on my app.So it, it--I almost always, exceed the 15 minutes,every time, at 15 minutes, I say,now enough for the dayand stuff like that,but I try to limitbetween 15 to 30 minutes a day.I've stopped consuming contenton social media.I think, this whole scrollingand trying to, so I have like,I'm lucky today that I can have a teamwith whom--who can, kind of scout for contentand then share it with me and say, Nithin,this is worth watching, reading, whatever.Because I don't even know,how people are managing it,because I think this,this whole thing is engineered,to kind of break youYeah.So it's a--yeah, I find, I find, I think,building an audience was very easybecause we had a unique story to sayand a unique perspectiveon building business and life, et cetera.So, building an audience was easy,but staying sane, is very, very hard.It is, it is.I often tell this to people,what you, what you may not realize isthe world's brightest minds,are 24x7 workingto keep you addicted to these apps.There's no hope in hell for you guys.Don't drive me.I'll motivate myselfand exercise self-control to wean me away.No, that's not going to happen.Youâre literally fightingwith a collective IQof the brightest peopleon Earth right now.Yeah, that's, that's just there.Got it. Awesome, man. I love that.Here's a question,I'm very interested to know the answer of,which start-up, if not Zerodha,and you have to pick one,would you want to be the CEO of today?The thing is, I mean, I have a--so, one of the most exciting things,I think, about my job,the position I am in todayis that I have no obligations.And the only other personI know in the office,Sridhar Vembu, so who is--and I saw some of your posts,I mean, maybe, now that you're buildingyour business without raising capital,so I don't think you have to pickanyone's phone call too,but I don't think I'd be able to do this,which is, interviewand be on camera all the time.Because I find it very hard.So maybe yeah, maybe Zoho and Vembu is--I think that's a really good one.Yeah.That's a good one.That's a really good one.Awesome. I love that.What's the--What's the most surprising,perhaps even shock,actually shocking would be the right,what's the most shocking statistics/factyou have encountered Nithin,pre and post pandemicspecific to say Zerodha,something that is like, whoa!What just happened?I mean, so, so I think just--I've generally been very pessimisticabout our business,right from day one.I started Zerodhaâ¦I see that often.And I think that's how I am as a person,which is,I'm always trying to kind of factoringthe worst-case outcome.So then, you know,your chances of staying rational remains.But when you're tryingto factor in that worst-case outcome,you're always constantly, almost being,ending up being pessimistic of sorts.So, I never thoughtthere are so many Indianswho can potentially investor trade the markets.In my head, the audience was shallow.I mean, even today it's shallow,but I thought it was much more shallowerthan what it is.And I'd assume that it'll takean X amount of time to growfrom point A to, point A to C types.I mean, in the sense, I never thoughtthat we can grow from 2 million customersto 11 million customers in two years.I didn't,I never thought that our revenuescan bump up as muchand or generate--the business can generate as much profitsbecause I didn't, I didn't even thinkthat there is such a large revenue poolfrom which you can, generate income.So that was, that was really surprising.I mean, even now, I'm kind of,like every month we are opening200-300,000 new customer accountsand I'm like, who are these,where are these people coming from?So, I'm quite shocked in that way.And, so yeah, so I mean, I,I even now, I think as India,the audience that can potentially invest,trade in the marketsis not more than 10 to 15 Cr.But I never, you never know.I mean, I might be potentially surprisedon that as well.We are at all-time highand if market continues to beatthe other asset classesin terms of returns,you never know, I mean, people,maybe even farmers will start investing,trade in the markets. You never know.So, but yeah,but it's unlikelythat something like that can happen.But I've been very surprised,in terms of the share market sizeand the value of investmentsthat has come through retail investorsover the last 2-3 years since.I would concur, man.I would absolutely concur.Something happened in the last two years,which is awesome. Great.I know you have an opinion on it,but I would love to very quicklygather your thoughts again.You've often said thatif you wanna be a full-time trader,good luck with that.It's not that you're gonna be sittingon lots of money,but there are surprisingly, and so,most of these questions,I should tell you, Nithin,these are not my questions,but these are questions,the audience have sent in for you,All right.And the recording one was,should I become a full-time trader?Because Nithin,who we really respect and adore,says not a good idea.So, what are we missing?Because we see so many storiesof people quickly making money overnight,so what, what is it?And these are,these are typically really young people,so I'm very scared for thembecause they must be luredby the charm of cheap quick money.So, anything that you wanna mindfullyshare with them?See, yeah, I mean,see one of the issues I've hadover the last 2-3 years,where we've benefited a lot from this,It was just,people coming to the stock marketswith the wrong expectations.Coming to the marketsthinking they can somehow makequick and easy money.I mean, I know I've said this before,that stock market is probablythe toughest placein the world to make easy money.I mean, it's easier buying lottery ticketsthan try to make money trading the marketsbecause when you buy lottery tickets,if you make some money,you're not gonna go buymore lottery tickets with that.You will probably go buy a house,car, whatever.But if you're trading the marketsand make money,that money is coming back to the markets.It's not going anywhere.And if you've made money in the wrong way,it all eventually,you tend to give it back.You cannot stay lucky for too long.So, the problem I've had is that,is that this whole, this whole audiencewhich is making it seem on social mediathat it's very easy to make money,and we know that it isnât.Because we have our customers,like less than 1% makemore than fixed deposit type of returns.And the regulator nowis actually asking us to mandate,I think in the next few weeks or so,where brokers will start sharing,like overall, what percentage of customeractually, make money and lose money,So maybeâ¦Wow.Yeah, I know, so maybe that'll kind of setthe expectations right.But the thing is,I keep talking about this as in,which is trading is almostlike running a business.If you look at all your friendsand family,see 100 people who started businessand see whoâs kind of survived,running a business 10 years,it'll be one, one out of hundred.I mean, it's just the same math.Trading is really hard.It's almost like running a business.The only thing easy about tradingis opening a trading account,not in the sensestarting a business is hard, as in,starting a trading accountis extremely easy,but otherwise, it's really hard.But the, the thing about tradingthough, is that,if you're good at it,I think it's one of the best thingsyou can do in your life.It just gives you financial freedom.You'll enjoy what you're doing.Like, Nikhil, my younger brotheris one of the smartest traders I know.And, I don't think he should be doinganything other than trading in his life.So, like that, if trading is your calling,I think doing trading full timeis the right thing to do.But how does someone figureif trading is your calling?I think, I think trade, give it 1-2 years,before you decide to do full time.See if you're enjoying itand that whole enjoying it,I think you need to be honest to yourself.Yeah.Because a lot of times, getting addicted,is counted as enjoying it.I mean, they're just two different things.When you enjoy something,you get better over time.And, so yeah,so the idea is to see if you,if you're getting better over timeand only when you're completely confidentthat you're good at it,and this is your calling,you're making some money,is maybe when someone should takethe risk of quitting a joband doing this full timebecause the other piece of informationthat I have is thatpeople who have another source of incometend to do much better tradingthan people who do only trading.Because trading,like lot of people think trading is aboutthat strategy that can help you pick upthe best stocks.It, isn't it, I mean,trading is all abouthow you manage the money,like in business, it's about where do you,on what kind of trades you put more money,on what kind of trades you don't put,I mean, it's all about money managementand all the money managementdepends on the,the fear and greed buyers that you haveand that,the chance that buyers impacting youis higher when this is your only thing.I mean, this is what will putfood on the table.So, so yeah, so I think, I thinkeveryone should give a shot at trading,if nothing else,it kind of teaches you lessonsin money and finance,which is very important, to survive,I think the next 30-40 years.But I think the biggest stockeveryone should have is on trading itself,which is give it some, 6 months, 1 year,it doesn't work, say what?This is not for me.And also I have said this before,that trading isn't just trading stocks.It is trading your time.It's about doing what has gotthe best return on your time of sorts.I mean, like, I think,Zerodha is the biggest trade in my life.A lot of people say,Nithin, why you not trading?I say, trading isn't that,I mean, I think I am,I can make the maximum return on my time,doing Zerodhaand so everyone needs to figurethat stuff out for themselves.Yeah, that's so true, man.That's so true, very well put.Awesome. Love that.A few questions about Zerodha,which I'm sureyou've answered at infinite,but I'd love to get this onthis one as well.One, will we ever see Zerodhaget into international markets, US stocks?I mean, it's on our list of things to do.The issue is it's a littleregulatorily gray,because, why is it gray?Is because, see, the thing istoday we want to offerinternational stocks,we need to partnerwith a broker in the US.If you partner with a broker in the US,you are kind of taking the riskon your head in a way.So that meanssee in the US what happens is,unlike in India, in the US,if a broker goes down,he can take,take down the customer securitiesalong with him.Like for example,when Lehman Brothers went down in 2008,they didn't just lose their own money,but they lost customer assets, etc.Because in the US,brokers sit on customers,they're almost like custodians.Do customer funds and securities,unlike in India.The SEBI regulation very clearly mandatesthat a broker shouldn't getinto any relationshipwhere there is risk coming on the table.So, so in a, in a,if you actually go regulat--in terms of,of course you can have agreements in placethat can put a Chinese wallbetween the two businesses,but it's still kind of regulatorily gray,and I think, for usit's just the risk of doing somethingregulatorily gray is too high.So, I mean, unlessthere are explicit regulations that allow,that allow us to do it,I don't think we'll do it.I think the other exciting developmenthere has beenwhat is happening in GIFT City,the NSE, IFSC,which is, a bunch of stocksare now listed in the GIFT City.So, it kind of comes underIndia jurisdiction.So, I have a feelingif we start offeringinternational securities,I think it will probably bethrough GIFT City,the exchange, which is in GIFT City,so because it's,I think it's more regulatory,it'll get all the blessings of sorts.Yeah, that makes sense.That makes a lot of sense.I would expect what the answerto the next question would be,but would you ever get into crypto?I mean,unless there are explicit regulationsthat allow us to do it;otherwise, otherwise no.Do you personally own crypto?No. No. Not at all. I mean, I mean,I mean, I got offered,stakes in a lot of these crypto exchangesat those angel seed round, and all.But I, I've taken, I've,as a business, I think one of the thingsthat we've done right, is that,we've always had thiswhole regulatory foresight of sorts,which is very importantfor a regulated business,saying that, how can regulationsplay out in the future?And then try to buildyour business for that.And crypto, I mean,right from day one, I knew that,until there are clear,explicit regulations,I don't think we should be doing it.So, I don't even,I haven't even ever owned any crypto,nothing related to crypto.Got it.Who, who manages your money, Nithin?Nikhil. Nikhil.[laughter]And, and, and is there, is there like a,is like a status check that happensevery quarterwhere we are and so onor is like just brotherly lovewhere I'm sure you're taking care of it.Yeah, no, I mean, the thing is,both of us said at one pointthat what is that minimum amountwe require to ensureour lifestyle can be maintainedfor X period of time,and we said that much moneyhas to be kept in a placewhich has zero risk.So, the safest place,and post that, I don't really care.I mean, once in six months,we sit with the chartered accountant,he runs us by the, whatever financials.And, otherwise, yeah,I'm not really bothered much about that.I would, I would've assumed so. All right.What's the, what's the hardest partabout running Zerodha?Yeah, I think, I think,I've fallen in love with the business,I donât know if I can say that,which isâ¦You have to pick one.Yeah. Which means I care too much aboutwhat customers say,and that affects me significantly,in the sense I think, you know, like,like I, every day, I get up thinking howdo we make life of our customers better?How do, how do we help them do their moneyand manage their money better?So, but the thing is,you wanna slip up as a business.I mean, there is no--We're a tech business,there'll be tech issues,thereâll, there'll be unrelated stuff,regulatory changes that can changethe user experience.I mean, the thing is,being the face of the business,I'm really right,it's like, I'm facing the firing squad.Yeah.So, so, yeah. So just, just,when, when customers are nastyfor whatever reasons,I mean, they probablyhave valid reasons to be nasty,but whenever they're nasty, it,it does affect me.And, so I, I've stopped, like I said.I, on social media, I just fire and forgetand I don't botherlooking at comments, etc.Because I was realizingthat I'm getting affected quite a bit.But I do get emails,customer writing me emailsbeing nasty, and that, that affects,I mean, it's a,we have done a decent jobover the last 3-4 yearsin terms of not having issues.But I think the first timewe scaled really quickly.But in 2017 to 2018,like that 1-2 years,we had a bunch of technical issuesin terms of downtime, etc.And, I mean, I don't know how many timesI thought of jumping off the building,and that was, that was,that, that piece of the businessis what is really hard.I mean, of course there is volatilityin the business.That's, I mean, I've been now doinga business for 20-25 years.Now I'm used to that roller-coaster.But just, just this whole falling in lovewith the business and the customer is, is,has, has its issues of sorts.It does man, it does.I, you know what,I'm reminded of this cardinal mistakethat I made, which was,I was also like this obsessed guy.Just make it right for the customerand all of those,which are by the way,wonderful things to have,but it shouldn't get to you,to paralyze you as such.So, we had this rating system at nearbywhere after every experiencethat you had, you could rate it 1 to 5.And I was like, you know what?I wanna, I wanna get the emailor the rating or the review of everyonewho rates us 1 and 2,to just get deep into that problem.I did that and 2 weeks of that, Nithin,and I was a complete zombie.I used to enter meetings,frustrated, irritated. I was like,everything is broken in this company.Everything is wrong.We're not doing anything right.People are like, what is wrong with you?I say, look at this,this is broken. That's broken.This is happening. That is happening.And then I just stepped backbecause I'm gladone of my founders, he was likeyou do realizethat whatever you are hearingis like 2% of everything that comes by.It's a 100% of your world,because that's all that you're hearing.But it is just 2% of the entire worldthat we all are getting used to.So yeah, we can go right around that,but you cannot lose your sanity over this.At some point,your sanity is perhaps the biggest thingthat will continue drivingthe ship forward.And that was a big reality check,I was,so I was a very different consumerof that feedback then after that point.Yeah. I haven't figureda fix yet for this, in a sense,I know at leaston social media, I know what I need to do,which is disconnect completely.But when I get emails, etc.I don't know. I mean, it does affect me.It's a, it is, yeah, it's,I don't know what's the solution.I mean, I can't fall off lovewith the customer or with the business,so I, yeah, so I, all the things, I,it used to affect my sleep, etc.So, one, one of the things I've done nowis that I shut down all my, all--I'm not online after 7:00 p.m.So it's, so I get like 1-2 hours of,of no activity before sleep.So, and that way at least I'm discon--and I'm not thinking about itwhen I'm sleeping.So, so yeah.So, it's, it's really hard, I mean,like a lot of these entrepreneurswho are just starting off.Because of the whatever valuationsuccess of sorts.Everyone comes to me and, with this hopethat somehow life gets better over timeas you become more successful.It's just time, the problems are differentand there is no,like, I'll make some money and suddenly,my life will get much better.I think more money just complicates life.So, it's yeah, I mean,of course people will give you creditfor the money, etc, but just life getsmore and more complicated.So, this stuff doesn't end.I mean, new challenges in life, I think.No, it doesn't. It doesn't.Here, here's a hack that helped me,which, which, which may, just one second,Yeah. YeahThere's a, there's a hack that helped methat may help you,but it could be very peopledependent as well, so I maintain,it's somewhat similar to,not somewhat, I shouldn'tdisregard what you're going through,but let's say at a,I didn't do this at nearby,and I wish I did,but I do this now as a content creator,there's enough and morethat hits you every dayin terms of feedback.Like people love you for what you doand people hate you for what you do,and I maintain these two folders,one's called life changingand one's called trolls,and life changing is all, all the really,really nice feedback that I get,which we tend to dismiss a lotbecause we are like, oh!People are just being nice, but it's niceand, and you feel warm about it,but then you very quickly move on.Because we just as humans,attracted towardsthe, the bad side morethan necessarily the good one.And there'll be, of course,enough and more trollsand mean-spirited commentsthat will come in,all of which would be valuableif I were to dissociate the wayit's communicatedand what they mean to say.Because if I just centered myselfon the message, I may gain a lot more.What I often do when I encounter somethingwhich affects me,not in a positive light,I go back to the life-changing folderand I go through few of those.And that just helps me personallyjust get back to that pointwhere I say, you know what?you, you're doing enough.But that doesn't meanthat you don't cater to this.Just read this for the objectivitythat it has,not for the tonality that it has,and then just continue the processbecause I'm sure, you're not the personwho wants to just say, oh, my job is done,and now take it or leave it,Zerodha is what it is,and it's not gonna improve.You're constantly workingtowards improving it.It's just taking its time and it will,and you'll always be aheadwith the curve in some waysand behind the curve in some ways.But at least what helps meis just to find that balance between,there are enough people who love youfor what you do,and there are people who perhapsdon't like what you're doing right now,but that doesn't meanthat you aren't fixing it.Yeah. Also I think,it's also about, I think,like, I still remember,when I met you the first timewhen we did that podcast,it was like a show or whatever we did.I think you just started,it was much beforeyou actually started off on your own.Yeah, yeah, yeah.And I could see that day that,that this was, this is we are,this is what you're good at.I mean, there was, there was likea twinkle in your eyes doing this.So I think we are lucky that we,we've all ended up picking up thingsthat we love to do.So, so you can run through it.Even if, even if, whatever obstacles,and this is really what I--like I have a seven-year-old son.and I think my, like the biggest,one of the top thingsto do in my life right nowis to help him figurewhat he likes, allow to do in his life.I think if you can somehow figure,you're lucky enoughto figure that in your life,everything else becomes a lot more easier.I was not doing broking,and say I was doing, say banking,I don't think I would've survived this.And, so it's...Yeah, no, so true man. So true man.And that's one such a wonderful goalto have towards your child,is just help them figure shit out.And then it's like autopilot.Awesome.Do you, do you read often, Nithin?Do you, are you a reader?I mean, no, I mean, historically I didn't,I, no, I was,I started trading quite early,so I've read a lot of booksaround trading and markets, etc.But, but I think in 2017,I got introduced to Audible,so I started listening to audio books.So, so yeah,so I kind of consumed a lot of content,but I mean, I switchedto a lot of these podcasts, etc.So, I mean, and I think last 1-2 years,very little books of sorts,but a lot of podcasts.Now I'm listening to something.I find it really interesting,I'm trying to figure stufflike what do I do next in my life?And I find it very interestingto listen to, people who have done,been there, done that, as in life.And just to kind of figurehow they're thinking about it, as in,now how did they handle success?How did they handle the failuresand what did they do with their business,once it, like I keep,every time I meet someone really big,I ask him, dude,how do you keep yourself wired?I mean, you're say 65, 70 years old.You've done this for like 45 years.Like, how are you wired?As in how do you, I mean, like, I just,I met Uday Kotak recentlyand I, that was my first question to him.I'm like,how are you like even doing this now?And I think, I think it's a,I don't know if I'll be ableto survive this, 20-30 years, no I mean,it's, it's, it's, it isn't,yeah, but I listen to podcast, I mean,I've read a bunch of really nice booksrecommended to me,but otherwise, it's usually podcasts.And you listening to songs?Yeah. Yeah.Music?Yeah. Yeah, absolutely, so--any one that you often go back to,like a favoritethat you have on loop somewhere.I mean, see Floyd is always the easiest,I mean, like, if I'm confused,the first thing you go to is Floyd,I love that.Yeah. But, I mean, I've, I've been,I like Hindi music, Bollywood,the classic Bollywood.I, my son plays drums,I play a little bit of guitar,so, we kind of jam up.So, he's been introducing meto all these newer bands,So, yeah, so I mean music,my mom used to be a veena music teacher,so it kind of,like kind of, runs in the family.So, I've woken up to musicfrom when I was maybe,like in my mom's womb.Wonderful.Yeah. So music is very importantpart of my life.Beautiful man. Awesome.What's the worst thing about you, Nithin?I mean, so one, one of, couple of peoplewho are brutally honest with meare Nikhil and Kailash.So, and Kailash especially,he is like my, I keep saying this,he is like my spiritual guru of sorts.So, he is usually very honest with me,and he says,one of my worst qualities is that,I try to, all this,these hard people conversations,I tend to postpone.And I do it mainly because I don't want tohurt the feelings of the other person.But, just, it just complicates with time.And there is no, I mean,the earlier you talk, it's easier,but I understand that.But I find it still very hard to do it.I almost, these, this heartfelt decision,I keep pushing it and pushing itand end up doing that conversationonly when it cannot continue anymore,And I, yeah. I mean, I've had,I've kind of made peace with it as well,Saying it's a bad quality in me.And, but it, if it somehow,I find it very hard to say,donât need this conversation right now.So, but yeah, but, but,I think it's put me in reallytricky situationswhere I've been stressed,because, it's kind of eating my mindthat I need to have this conversation.And, but yeah, so that's, that's,I think it's a bad quality.I've, I'm a very, I don't knowif it's a good or bad quality,but I canât,I canât stick to one thing for too long.I mean, outside, business.Yeah. I mean itâs likeâ¦So I, like in terms of my hobbies,in terms of, like what I like to do,I'm constantly switchingbetween different sports,different music, different like,for a few weeks I learned keyboards,now I want to learn drums.I mean, as soon as I get toa certain small level,I find it less,I start to find things boring of sorts,and tend to switch between thingsquite hard.So, which has also meant that,today, now, I regret so muchthat I didn't spend enough time on musicwhen I was younger.I mean, I play very likea below average guitar.So, I mean, I would love to,like today when I'm sitting home,I wouldâve loved to just sitand play solo to Floydin Bangalore or somethingbut I have friends who can do it,and I'm so freaking jealous about them.[laughter]Love that, I love that.What's the most expensive thing you own?I mean, I think the house,as in, you know,  I meanbecause it's,yeah, I think, I think the house.What's the most expensive thingafter the housethat you think you will own?So, there is, when I was younger,I've done all those,buy watchers, buy cars, etc.So, but it hasn't caught up with my,net worth of sorts in a sense.It plateaued off quite earlyand now it doesn't even excite,I mean, I find the Apple Watch so awesomethat I cannot go back to,like a watch is not really a watch for mein the head anymore.So, the cars, I mean,I used to be very excitedabout sports cars, etc.But, I mean it's,today I don't feel like owning it.No private jet in the picture?Oh, absolutely not, no.No, I think, I think it's just,I hope, I don't have to regret saying thisbut I think in, in a country like India,owning a jet is kind ofborderline ugly of sorts.Because it's just,it's just the wealth concentrationis such a big problem in this countryand so, yeah, so I wouldn't do it.But yeah, like I said, I hope,I don't how to regret this tomorrow.The news article, Kamath Brothersâ¦All right.Just, just make sure no one in the familyis gifting you one...That's, no that's, no that's the thing,the reason I'm saying it is thata lot of these times,decisions are not just made by me now.That's what,next thing you know,like on your birthday, like surprise!You're 42, right?Yeah, I'm 42 years.So, your 50th isâ¦Yeah, I turned 42 in October.Got it, got it. Yeah.So your 50th is,what you have to watch out for.Because your 50th will be when,when somebody might lose their shitand be like, let's just buy an islandor a private jet or something.God. Okay.Today, between watches and cars,what would you pick?Cars, I mean,watches, I think has lost it's,I mean, I don't even knowwhy I was so attracted to watches before.I think it was just, it was just a market,like an amazing marketing pitch because,like I find it, I understand,there's a lot of whatever craftsmanshipthat's gone behind good watches,but I don't understandwhy they're as expensiveas they are and God knows.So yeah, so car at least you can enjoy.So, I like driving fast,so I wouldn't, I mean,I wouldn't mind getting into a circuitand drive fast.Awesome. Between beaches and mountains?Beaches.And what would be your favoriteinternational travel destination?I mean I like, snorkeling, diving, etc.So, I've done Maldives, quite a few times.Yeah and, but Thailand also, I love.I love Phuket, Koh Samui,I mean, I'm, like I said,you can put me on the beachand I, when I,I still remember when we started Zerodha,had this whole thing, saying,if we get to 100,000 customers,I'm gonna set up a shack by the beach and,and move away from town,in Goa, and we'll have a bandplay every night,and have a basketball courtnext to the shackwhere I'll play basketball.Yeah, I mean,that was at 100,000 customers,we are at, I don't know,like 11 million customers todayand it hasn't happenedSo, itâs time to make that happen.Awesome man. Last question.Pick between speed and perfection.I think speed.Yeah. Becauseâ¦Is that driven by the cars?No, not, I mean, I think, I think,I don't think there's anythingcalled perfection.It's really hard to be perfect.And that's, that's,you can get into like a rabbit holetrying to be perfect.I think you need to just,at certain point once,as a business also,I think the only reason, we are,where we are today is, is the speed.I mean, we are a very agilekind of a business,so I keep saying this,we are the size of an elephant today,but we move like a cheetahand that's really what keeps usahead of the competitionand for everyone building a business,I think,like what Rupert Murdoch has said,it's about the fast beating the slow,and not really the bigbeating the small anymore,like in today's world.And, so yeah, so I think, we don't,historically as a business,we haven't waited for a perfect productand a perfect--because there is nothing like that.And just the speed of executionis really what matters.Brilliant. Awesome.Thank you so much, Nithin.This was wonderful. I had so much fun.Thank you for being so candid, so honestand then picking up all the 20 questionson the trot.All the best with everything.As I said, I love what you do.I am such a big fan,you've made such a big difference,you, what you guys have built together,and I'm, I'm rooting for your success.Thanks. Thanks, Ankur,for having me on this.Awesome.
