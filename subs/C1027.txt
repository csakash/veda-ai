Check 1 2 okAditya, this is yourtest video for the week.This is on metaverseso you will have to bringin the magic of NFT.For reference, go and check outDhruv Rathi's metaverse video.The editing is slightly tacky,but I like all the componentsthat he brought in together,especially when Mark Zuckerbergtalks about metaverse,so on and so forth,so use that as an inspiration,and hopefully, this will workjust as well as an NFT.So no start or finish for this,I will go straight into it.Recently Facebook changedits name to Meta.Why would such a huge companychange its name?And what kind of a name is Meta?Why has metaverse becomeso popular and what exactlyis its foundation?I want to share all thiswith you in this video.First of all, the universeis the place where we live,and the universe meansthat there is just one worldin which all of us live.UniVerseMeta is a Greek wordand Meta means somethingwhich is beyond,something which is over and above.When you hear the word metaverse,its actual meaning is somethingthat is beyond the universe,and that is how the metaverseis conceptualized.Just imagine that right nowyou are watching me on YouTube,but if you could put on a headset,sit with me in my office,and listen to me, maybe even touch me,maybe even high-five me,maybe even talk to me, play with me,be on a call with me,all without leavingthe comfort of your home.And imagine if I could do thissimultaneously with lakhs and croresof people, because the onewho is talking to you, is not me,it's a digital version of me.If you find it fabricated and weird,that is the basis of metaverse.Metaverse is the imagination of a worldwhere you can virtually, digitally,create a new world for yourself.A lot of you must have playeda lot of video games,and whenever we play thosebecame there is a version of uswho is doing the actions,and because of that we buya lot of virtual goods as well.We buy guns, clothes, grains,buildings, and cars,that is just the start ofwhat could potentiallyhappen in the future.When you are playing that game,you are in a two-dimensional world.There is a screen or phonein front of you,and you assume that figure,that avatar to be yourselfand play that game.What if you could wear a headset,you have headphones, you have sensors,and through that experience,you find yourself inside that game.You are not just playing the game,you are the game,that is the concept of the metaverse.It was first introduced inthe 1970s or 1980s as a concept,where the world is devastated,there is no real action,and everybody is livingin this brilliant Utopian worldwhere everything is alright.You can think of it as heaven or whatever.In real life, people don't even go out,but with their headset,they are living in another world.That is how the genesis was.And gradually as the technology improved,the concept of metaverse became stronger.In fact, if you will go back,and this is something you would all knowif you have been playing video gamesfor many years, if you lookat the first version ofthe most popular video gamesthat are used today,to their current version,you will see a huge difference.Earlier we used to see a pixelated form,now you get an absolutewell-rounded experience,and that is just how technologyhas traveled.Processing speeds have becomeso much better.The Internet has become so much strong.The entire technology and hardwarehave become so much better.And now you take it 10-15 years ahead,and you are now sitting inthe possibility of what metaversecould be.What would be the use cases of metaverse?One purpose of metaversecould be work purposeswhere through remote workingwe come on a zoom call,chit chat, and go away,but imagine you are wearing a headset,wherever you are,I am in Faridabad right now,and I want to have an actualin-person call with my teamwhich we have on every Monday,then I will get a headset for everybody,and then we will log on to our metaverse,where there would be an office,or we would be sitting in a park,or a restaurant.We can create that whole world,or we can take it from somebody on rent,and then we will sit together.We would actually be ableto see everybody,and they will then choosethe avatar that they want.For work, they may choosetheir own avatar.So for work, my avatar wouldbe myself only.But as my work would finish,my second use case of metaversecomes in,where I want to live in a virtual worldwith an anonymous identity.So I will change my avatarand suddenly I will becomea cool dude from the boring unclethat I am.And that cool dude ismaybe 22 years old,maybe its name is Koo, hint hint!And he loves FDs!Completely different from who I am.And perhaps, I will go to clubs,I will go golfing,I will go eating out,I will meet new people,I will wear clothes that I want to,drive cars that I want to,carry phones that I want to.I would be living inan absolutely new world,where I am actually meeting people,because everybody else is also like me,living a different identity,and making it happen.And then that ends,I spend some time in that world,and before sleeping I feellike having some entertainment,so I go to the gaming world,and I there then start gaming.And as I said, I am not justplaying that game,I would be that game.I would be within the game playingand actually competing with others inwhatever it could be, racing,strategy, sports,the end.Whatever it could be.And these are the threepredominant use casesfor the metaverse.And that's just the start.In the future, it can be usedfor healthcare, education,relationships or dating,hopefully, it will not replacephysical intimacy,but you never know where the world goes.At the end of it, if thistechnology gets proven,and this technology becomesa very integral part of our lives,just like the phone and the internet,then there is no limit to wherethe metaverse can take you.Now all this must be soundingvery depressing.It must be sounding likewe are living human beings,we can move our bodies,we can be actually in a physical world,and that will also be a choice,it will not go away.If we will not mess up our Earth,if we will not bring it toa condition where we cannoteven survive in it,then the world will continueto live offline,the world will continueto live online,and people will make their choicesjust as they do today.Even nowadays many people stay awayfrom their phones,many people just stick to their phones,and both of them coexist,yet we all come together ina physical environment wheneverthe need is.Can you earn money in the metaverse?How do you actually go on to a metaverse?And to know this, I will take youthrough what are the existingmetaverse platformsthat are out there.If you go to coinmarketcap.comwhich tracks all the crypto coins,and then you will go intothe metaverse, then you will see,by rank here are the topmetaverse coins that areavailable in the crypto world.Since Metaverse is a digital world,then its money would also be digital.If you want to buy a car,some artwork, clothes, gadgets,all of that will requirea digital currency,and it will also requiresomething which is decentralized,because if you will keepconverting your money throughUS dollars, Indian rupee, UK pound,so on and so forth,then it is still dependenton a central agency which is notin the concept of the metaverse.So cryptocurrencies becomea very important tool tothis entire world,where through cryptocurrenciesof the metaverse,or any independent cryptocurrencylike Bitcoin, Ethereum,that will be the way valueis exchanged and transferred,and then blockchain will be the waythrough which identitiesare maintained and a ledger is kept.Everything that is happeningin the metaverse, since it isan actual universe and a worldthat we are building,needs to be recorded.It's not possible that todayyou are wearing this t-shirt,but tomorrow you can't find thist-shirt because somebody stole it.There needs to be identity tracking,and there needs to be an accountabout who bought what and whenwith how much money,and they are the owners of that.That will be done through blockchain.Through this, NFTs becomethe big thing in the metaverse.I created a video on NFTwhich I encourage you to watch,but basically, the idea isthat non-fungible tokensare something that you buy digitally,and you cannot find theirreplica anywhere else,is the concept of non-fungible tokens.And when in the actual world,you buy a t-shirt and wear it,people know that it is your t-shirt,but in the digital world,how would people know ifthat t-shirt is yours or not?Through an identity trackerwhich will be attached to the NFT.If you buy this t-shirt,whether it's a digital good,whether it's a unique T-shirtthat is the only one inthe whole world,all of that will be establishedon the blockchain using the NFT.These are the top coins of...These are the top metaverse coinsthat are there in the world right now.You must have heard aboutBored Ape Yacht Club,that is what APE is.Sandbox is a very very big metaverse.Decentraland is a very big one.Theta Network is, Axie Infinity is,these are all metaversesand these are their coins.And you can buy these coins,and then buy thingsin their metaverse.So how do you make moneyon the metaverse?Let's say you are inAxie Infinity or Sandbox,and there in the metaverse,you want to buy land,just like in the physical worldyou buy some land.So you would go and say,'I want this parcel of land.'Why?I because that parcel of landhas some importance,maybe it's in a good localityin the metaverse,or you want to build something on it,a shop, factory, school,whatever the case may be,or some famous people live around,or people because of whom you knowthat the value of this landwill increase,so you make a bet on that,just like you would makeany other investment in real estatein the actual physical world.You can buy that landthrough this coin.It could be directlythrough the metaverse,if it is an organic or primary sale.Or somebody who already owns it,and you give them an offer,and buy it secondary,just like in the real world.Whether you buy it directlyfrom the builder,or if somebody has alreadybought that apartment, that house,that land, and you buy itfrom them in resale,the metaverse would also workin exactly the same way.Once you have that land,you can sell it again ata higher price,which you can do inthe physical world as well,or you can rent it out which againyou can do in the physical world.Rent to who?Anybody who wants to build a shop,they can use it foradvertising purposes,whatever the case may be,this is exactly how you would do itin the real world, and is nowbeing replicated in the metaverse.So the machinery functionsof the world and not different.The execution of the world,how we enter into that world,and how does that world entersinto us, that is what isthe difference using technology,using virtual reality,augmented reality, but the conceptsof the world remain the same.Risks?It's too early!So what I would love for youto do is stay involved froma distance, at least this iswhat I am doing,where I will track what ishappening in the metaverse,I will occasionally go,I have my avatars,I hang out there,but I am not indulgingin any transactions,I am not engaging with people,in general, I am definitelynot disclosing my identity,because you don't know who is it,what is it, what do they want or not,and gradually just as you goin a new city, you meet people,you get to know about different places,what is its culture,what is its mannerisms,what are its rules,you will get an understandingof all that, you will do itthe same way on the metaverse itself.Because it is technology,and you can do everything instantly,it does not mean that youshould do it instantly.My suggestion:If you want to engage financiallyin the metaverse,do it with the expectationthat your money will be lost.Please don't do it to make money,because it's way too earlyfor making investments,particularly if you are notan active investor in equityor fixed income.If you haven't started there,and you are directly investingin crypto and the metaverse space,according to me, it would be very risky,and I would not recommend it.But in general, my belief isthat the metaverse is the future,NFTs or a way of showingthat you have this thing,I am the rightful owner of that,will be the conclusive way ofdetermining ownership,and the combination of that,plus increasing technologyand the pace of it,will completely change the waywe live in the world.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
