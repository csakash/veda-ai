Okay Piyush, this video is aboutSeven Habits of Highly Successful People.In this I'll, again, there is no intro.Will go straight into the conversation.I'll literally start with number one.Number one, and then get started.So, nothing comes in between.Use a lot of B-rolls.Use a lot of supers.Use lots of sound effects.I will try and make this video...about 10 to 12 minutes.So, your goal would bethat this should have at leasta 40% retention.Means should be roughly above 5 minutes.And the video will be of 12 minutes.So that is how we will have to do it.That needs to be your singular goal.So, inside every 30 secondssomething should happenthat captivates the audience.Whether it's a B-roll,whether it's a super,whether it's a sound effect,something that breaks the monotonyand focus singularly.All right, okay.So, whatever the cuts etc. would be,keep doing it a lot.Make it fast paced.All right, let's get started.So straight into the video.Number 1:They prepare and practice.No one is knowledgeable right from birth.Each and everything is achieved graduallythrough devotion and complete dedication.Successful people have this habit.They never get into anything unprepared.They don't work on the fly, on anything.They recognizewhat is expected out of them.They recognizewhat are the expectations from themselvesand they work towards that day and night.Which is why I had saidthat when successful peopleseem to be successful overnight,there is hard work and practiceof many after hours behind it.Number 2:They are proactive.People are often reactive.So, they react to whateveris happening to them.Someone gave you feedback,you will react to that.Someone told you that your work is amiss,you will improve it.If someone said itâs right,then you will be happy.But all of that is reaction.Proactivity is when you can anticipatewhat is about to happen.For example,if you are doing your work,your manager has given you some work.He said, do these three things.You will ask yourselfwhy he asked me to do these three things,and if I focus on that one thingproactively do not 3,but 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 things,then it will make me reach that target,that goal fasterand in a better manner.This is the foundationof successful people.Number 3:They have a routine.Many people likethat I do not have any routine.I wake up at night, when I feel like.Sorry not at night.When I wake up at morning,maybe waking up at night too.I wake up at morning, when I feel like.Wake up in the noon, when I feel like.I don't have a routine.I work nights.I work during the day.I do this, I do that.That basically meansyou don't have any set pattern.And our mind only works on patterns.If you remember the first timeyou drove a car, rode a bike,you were scared.You were seeing everything.The cow coming before you.That horn honking.People coming before you.Vehicles coming before you, speed breaker,But today you drive as if,hey! I am blindly in love.So, you talk on the phone,listening to musiceating popcorn continue driving.How did that happen?Because you got your brain to developthat chemistry and that mechanismthat you do things again and again.That becomes a routine.That becomes a habit.That becomes a schedule.So successful people repeat things.I for example, have made an entire videoon how I spent my week,in that you'll see that a lot of thingshappen in a repeat pattern in a week.I shoot my videos on MondaysAnd on Mondays only, come what may,flood, sunshine, shade, whatever happens,I have to shoot my videos.And that becomes a routine.So, my brain starts developingall the process, all the machinerythat is needed to accomplish this routine.I have a morning routine,which starts from 4:30-5:00 am,in which I meditate,read books, go to play, go to the gym.Have a good breakfast.Get my kids ready for school, so on.And all of that sets me up for the day.I am not sayingthat because I am successful,you will be too, if you follow my routine,what is important isthat you create a routine of your own.Because if that works for you,then that brain of yours will amplifythat this thing is working so wellthat tomorrow when you have to dothe same thing,it will need minimum energyand it will feel likethis is happening autopilot by itself.Number 4:They give more importanceto important things than urgent things.Often our life gets consumedby only urgent things.Someone calls, itâs urgent,so we will do the work.If any e-mail comes, itâs urgent,then we will do the work.Receive some notificationor message from someone,itâs urgent, then we will leaveall our work and attend it.The more you spend timetowards urgent things,the less you will spend timeon important things.For example,going to gym is not urgent.If you do not go today,nothing will change in your life.Nothing will happeneven if you don't go tomorrow.But after 10 yearsyou will start seeing its impact.But it is importantand is important for this reason.So, the more you focuson important thingsas against urgent things,the more you plan for the future.Investing for exampleis important, not urgent.If you do not invest your money today,there's isnât going to be any differencein your life.But after 5-10 years,when you will realizethat you only earned money,but never made that money to work for you.You will realize the importanceof having investedwhen you were told to.That's the difference between a successfuland a not so successful person.They are centered,that the important things in my lifeare just as importantas the urgent things areand all that noise is saying,attend me, attend me.Number 5:They think win-win.They know that no one needs to losein order for them to win.And because if someone else has won,it does not mean that their defeatis fixed or certain.This mentalitywhere you think someone else's losscan make me winor someone will else losebecause of my victory,is called a zero sum gamewhere we think if anyone in the worldhas become +1then someone has to become -1for it to workbut the world is not a zero sum game,it is an infinite sum game.There are crores of opportunitiesin the world for all of usand nobody needs to losefor someone else to win.Successful people know this.Whenever they enter into a negotiationso they knowthat if I can make another person winso my own chances of winningwill also be more.If they work in a team they saythat if I can help someone elsein his victory,then my chances of winningwill also increase,and that is called an infinite sum gamewhere potential, opportunities,the entire value of the worldis not limited but it is unlimitedand for everybody.Number 6:They first try to understand,not that others should understand them.This is a brilliant difference.Often, we feel that people understand us,people see us, people appreciate us,people speak well about us,and our entire focusgoes into impressing people.But successful peopleinstead focus on the person.They try to understand them.They try to find outwhat do they know that I don't.Because if I knew thatthen I will know something that I don't.It will make me a better versionof who I am.And this is a very beautiful quality,nature of successful people.And that sets them apart.So anytime you feel like,during a conversation,that you're trying to impressthe other person,just pause and remind yourselfthat if you try to understand that person,try to listen, try to know,they will automaticallybe impressed by you.Because it is so rare in this worldthat whenever it happenspeople's attentioninstantly goes towards it.Number 7:They know that nothing is going to happenon their own.They believe in a team.They understandno one has achieved glory single-handedlyand they can achieve something greatonly together.Because of this, in addition to number 5,where they think win-win,play an infinite sum game,they know that other peopleare better than them at something else.And if they work with those peopleand become as involved in their progressas they are in their own progress,they will move forward.The best example I have,is my own team.If I come on your screen and make a videoyou think I'm the one doing everything,but there are so many people behind me,there are editors, graphic designers,distributors, data individuals,contact writerswhich, after understandingall these nuances,combine them in a packageand bring it all in front of you.So, my experience is limited only to this.But by joining the teamit becomes a massive machinerywhich can be true for yourself as well.So, these were the seven thingswhich define successful peoplein their life.If you want to be successful,then you have to absorball these seven things in your life.Out of this, if anything is left behind,then you will always feelthat you didn't do your besttowards making your lifethe one which you wanted for yourself.I hope this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.Okay!I have shot somethingaround 10:30 minutes.There was some chat in the first minute.So, it is around 9 to 9:30 minutes only.But immerse it nicely in B-roll,properly apply voice-over from somewhere,apply pauses, doing all of thatmake it into a really nicemagnetic kind of a video.Okay, all the best.
