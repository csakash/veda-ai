Check 1 2 check 1 2 okLet's get startedIn this video, I will share with you30 options through which you,as a college student, can earn money.Friends recently put a post on theYouTube community that what arethe ways using which all the college students,who are my followers, earn money.And that needn't be restricted to onlycollege students, if you are workingor even if you are not working ornot studying, what are the sources of income,whether active or passive,through which you can earn extra money.I will share all those ways with youin this video, which have been compiledthrough all the responses that I have got.Thanks particularly to Anubhav Goyal,who wrote a bumper post in whichhe listed some 20-25 options,most of which were very relevant,so thank you Anubhav for your contribution.There were many other peoplewho I cannot name here, of course.I received about 1,000 comments,but what I have done is gathered, compiled,and now present to you all these options thatyou can use to earn money as a college student.Number 1 category, academicsSo how can you earn money through academics,whether you are a good student or you like to teach?Number 1 is a traditional way,going on from my parents' time,which even I used in my childhood,not my childhood but when I was incollege to earn money,was private tuition or offline tuitions.I still remember when I was in college,I used to teach science to a 7th or 8th studentand physics to an 11th class student.I used to get â¹400 per hour back then.For the 7th or 8th class,I think I used to get about â¹75 per hour,which was an insane amount of money back then.Private tuitions remain by far the bestand the most predictable way to earn money.But since the world has shifted to onlineand remote mode, therefore onlinehas also become a great medium.You can either teach as an online teacher,if you go on Unacademy or Udemyor make your own course, then youcan actually create something whichis a mini capsule of an academic journey,and then you can train students around it.But a very interesting optionwhich has emerged is helping internationalstudents in doing their homework.Go to websites such as Chegg C H E G G .com orSo if you go to websites such as Chegg C H E G G .com,all the links are available in the description,chegg.com or bartleby.com, I hope I ampronouncing it right, B A R T L E B Y .com,they are actually homework helping sitesand from there if you can helpinternational students in doing their homeworkwhile sitting anywhere in the world,then you will get money to answer their questions.You can also do that on Fiverr for Upwork,but please please please take utmostprecaution there, because many siteswhich are not predominantly for homework,if they get to know that you are helpingother people with their homework,then you can be banned as well.So please sign up with full cautionon a freelancing site for homework helpingor homework projects. But Chegg and Bartlebyare specifically created for homework only.You can also interestingly, I never did itbut I know many of my friends used to do it,help your seniors or juniors in completingtheir assignments or their projects.It sounds kind of illegal so, of course,do it only if it's right for you or not,but there are many people who are lazyor are not interested in studies,they don't want to study but have the money,so they outsource someone to completetheir project or their homework,there are enough and more opportunitieswhere you can earn money by helpingseniors and juniors in theirprojects and assignments.And then finally, if you are a great notes taker,you take notes of everything that teachers say,then you can convert those notes intoan eBook and sell it, or convert thosenotes into an actual eBook,not just a photocopy, but a properlymade eBook and sell it on Amazon orany other eBooks seller website, and make money.For example, if you list your eBookon gumroad.com, and it doesn't need tobe expensive, you can charge $1 or $2 for it.Suppose you have made an eBook ontrigonometry or algebra or zoology or accounting,anything which is your area of specialization,and you feel you have done amazing work,it would really help the students,then you can go on to gumroad.comor create your eBook on Amazon ormake a PDF and send it in your owncircle on WhatsApp and charge themâ¹50 or â¹100 through Paytm,whatever the case is.Remember on this, I have a Start-up course,which I do not promote actively on this channel,I run ads but I don't talk about it directly,a student wrote to me, I think hewas in 3rd year, he asked me whetherhe can make PDF notes out of that coursesince he really liked it and sell it?I was so happy with the initiativeI said please go right aheadSo he made the PDF notes, he sharedthem with me, I really liked them,and then he sold them for â¹99or something like that.And I am not sure, I didn't ask himhow much was the sale, but just the factthat he picked up a course which isfor around â¹1500, and he madePDF notes of it for â¹100, I can imaginethere must be a lot of students whowould be wanting to take the coursebut cannot afford it, they can then buythat eBook for â¹100 andthat is just happy money.Super smart in the academic category!The second category is freelancingNow freelancing is a huge categoryand there are many options in it that haveemerged especially in today's remote world.For instance, video editing is a majorlygrowing option. There are manycontent creators who do not know video editingor don't like to do it, or it is time-consumingfor them. So, you can do a video editing courseand do editing for them.Similarly, graphic designing,creating thumbnails, posters, invites.So those who make good content,have a vast distribution but do not knowgraphic designing, they don't wantto learn or do it, then you can do it for them,all it takes is a simple graphic designing course.For content writing, which is a vast sphere.I know how useful are content writers,whether they write captions for you,or blogs, or posts, or they convertone post of yours on Instagram toanother on Twitter, whatever the case is.So basically, if you know, content,or video, or graphic, and through that,you are freelancing for somebody.Photography or videography alsocome under this category.Even have reduced a bit so photographyis not so prevalent, but marriagesare still happening so there are manypre-wedding shoots and post-wedding shootsor maternity shoots, so on and so forth.Videography is already prevalent,as the world is opening up,more events are happening. If I deploysomeone to shoot an ad or video for me,where I am speaking but I needsomeone to just hold the cameraand do it in HD or do it with a Kimble,all those things, skill is very importantfor all these things but if you have thatskill then it is a wide spectrum for you,right from a beginner to an expert levelwhere you can play around.Since you are a student and yourfundamental economic need is not that much,you become very competitivebecause there is not much deficiency in your skillbut your price point is very attractive,so suddenly a lot of people could work with you.Now, where will you get accessfor all these freelancing skills?I think the best way for it is content creators,and to approach content creators,the best way is cold emailing.Today my team is of 13 people,I started in March 2020 with 6 people,from whom one has left so now 5 are there.After that from 5 to 13, 8 people whohave been added to the team are throughcold email only. Someone emailed me,sent me a DM on Instagram, LinkedIn,or Twitter, wherever, that is how I foundthat talent. I have never posted ajob requirement, except for one I recently posted.So, I have personally experienced thepower of cold email because I myselfwrite cold emails, receive them,and you should absolutely do that.I made a series of emails on cold emailing...I made a series of videos on cold emailing,please check them out that how to writethe right cold email. Otherwise, you can goon Fiverr, Upwork, and create your profile,bid for projects, it is competitiveso there are chances that you would not getit in the beginning but as you keep working,even if you do it for free,the main thing is to take a reviewor testimony from them, because if theydo it and your rating improves,then your ranking will improve and that ishow you start getting organic business.As an Indian student, you can also dofreelancing in translation while sittingat home. There are many destinationslike Lionbridge Appen, all the linksare again in the description,which gives you translation services.So, you can translate Hindi into Englishor if you know any foreign languagethen you can translate that language inEnglish, whatever the case may be.There are many remote working optionswhich as a student you should totally totallyconsider while sitting at home.Market research is another such opportunityMarket research is not done just offline,now it is done online too.There are many research agenciesthat ask you to review products,websites, give your consumer feedbackso that they know what is working,what is not working, all of those couldbe things that you sign up for as a student.Then the third category is codingI am talking about coding specifically becausesoftware development is a vast sphereand if you are a good software developerthen you can actually earn good moneyas a college student. The first thing isyou do freelance app and web development,whether you want to create a website or app,whether on iOS or Android,whether on native or a platform like React,if you know how to create a websiteor an app then you can freelance formany people and earn really good money.Again, Fiverr and Upwork aregreat destinations to start.If you have a personal connect,a business, or a connection by parents,whatever the case may be, do small jobsfor people who want to create a websiteor an app, do not charge much,just take reviews and testimonials,ask for references, and that is how youwill build this entire space.The good thing is that through thisyou get to practice also because codingis ultimately a game of codingmore and more and more so that yourcode is more effective even if simple,and as powerful as a long code.Another option then is to participatein hackathons or coding competitions.There are many companies that announceand organize hackathons,there are many coding competitionswith sizable prize money, in lakhs,there was nothing like that in my time,so if you are a coder or you want to learnhow to code then coding competitionsand hackathons are agreat great great way to make money.The third and very interesting optionis called the bug bounty program.Bug bounty programs orBounty Hunter programs are thosepeople who find mistakes in an appand tell the company that,'I have found this mistake in your app',and based on it they get a bug bountyor money basically.The larger the company the bigger theirabsolutely formal bug bounty program would be.For example, Facebook Google, Amazon.Now naturally they would have lesser mistakes,so it would be a struggle to find mistakesin them are you may not even find them,but there are many emerging start-upsthat have a bug bounty program.Even Nearbuy had it. We didn't give moneybut we used to give certificates thatyou helped us in our bug bounty program,you found the bugs for us,and we are acknowledging you for that,and those certificates then were usedas part of your resume, as part of anything elsethat is building your credentials.We couldn't give money becauseit was a small company.But now there are many peoplewho are ready to give money and you,if you are an ethical hacker shouldtotally totally totally considerthe bug bounty program as well.Then comes your standard part-time jobsThere are many kinds of part-time jobsYou can do part-time jobs in events,in delivery, in restaurants, in KPOs,and all of these options are there butunfortunately, part-time jobs area slightly sizable commitmentso it gets a little difficult to manage italong with studies. I would encourageyou to only consider them if you reallyneed money, consider it only whenyou are not able to arrange it fromanywhere else because they reallydrain you in terms of time.A good part-time option though is ifyour university is quite big and you geta part-time opportunity in the university.There are many university roles thatare available part-time because they don'twant a full-time person there and theycan save a lot by hiring a studentbut get almost the same quality.For example, part-time jobs in library,or in computer labs, or in sports facilities.So if your university is big, the campusis really huge and it has physically started,then please go to the university administrationand ask them if any university part-time jobis available which you can do,they might have something for you.Next is one of my favorites, flippingFlipping means you buy somethingat a cheap price and then you flip itand sell it at a higher price.I personally did this when I was astudent in the US, when I boughtAsian edition books from India,from Nayee Sadak, which is a reallybig book market in Delhi,and then when I went back to the US,I sold them as used books.So I bought them here for about â¹400and there I sold them for about â¹4000because the MRP of those booksthere was about â¹8-10000.I was a physics student, so science booksare generally expensive in the US.So used books are a great flipping thing,domain flipping is a really really big.Domain flipping means you registera website domain, and since you feelit has a sizeable traction orsomething is going to happen becauseof which that domain name can bein demand, so you flip it.It's a bit like gambling because youdon't know what will work, what will not work,so you will have to buy many of them.Only do it if you have the moneyotherwise it may not be a great option.And then the last thing that you can flipis IT hardware. When students leavecampus or hostel, they leave many things behindlike a mouse or USB cable,nothing is wrong with them,just that, maybe they are slightly dirtyor a circuit won't be working,if you know how to fix them, great,even if you don't know how to fix them,just clean them up properly and test them.The ones which would be workingyou can literally spread them on a matand put it on sale, you can makesome nice happy money to that,and flipping is something that will continuehappening all through your college years.Next is content creationContent creation is a very exciting category.It has only emerged in recent times.There was nothing like it during our times.Facebook only started growing around 2006,but content creation on YouTube,LinkedIn, Twitter, creating blogs,running newsletters, running podcasts,all of those are great options for you,however, it doesn't generate immediate money.It will take at least one ideally two yearsfor you to reach a positionwhere you can monetize it.So, if you are looking for short-term moneythen content creation may not be for you.But if you want to create a long-termdistribution because of which peoplewould know you and your platformswould be famous, so on and so forth,then this may be a great investmentfor you to make.Finally business ideasI think the best opportunity as acollege student is if you can get yourhands dirty and start a business or a Start-up.However small it may be, you don't need tomake that start-up into a unicorn,you don't need to raise funding.Something which gives you abusiness understanding that how is aproduct sold to a customer,how to earn money through that,and how do you ensure thatthat money is more than your costso that your business is profitable.There are many business ideasthat a student can undergo.Some example, number 1,you can open a food stall,if your campus is big enoughand especially if your college premisesis closed during the night and you don't haveanything for late-night deliveries,so on and so forth, then you can do that.Or you can start a delivery network inyour campus, so that if people want toorder something like, pens, cigarettes,or something else, or if you know thatthey want to buy a textbook froma market nearby, whatever the case is,so you are essentially running a deliveryservice of sorts, helping them so thatyou will get the cost for the productbut also earn money througha markup over and above it.You make websites and apps forsmall businesses, so it is nothing relatedto college. If you are a coder then you canfreelance but you can also start yourown business, which is an agency business,where you can serve restaurants, spas,salons on Instagram in India or even outside.There are businesses that have a verified profile,you go on their website and see thatit is absolutely rubbish, so what do you do?You actually create a website for them,DM them that, 'I have created awebsite for you, it's going to belive for one week, if you want itwe can go ahead or if you do not want itthen I will withdraw it and it will belet's say $100 a month'.You will be easily able to manage yourexpenses and in $100 you will makereally good awesome money.You may not have 100% successso if you send 20 DMs, maybe 2 will returnbut you will more than compensatefor the effort and the cost that you have put inby running this nice happy business.You can also create a cloud kitchen.Cloud kitchens are kitchens or restaurantswhere people do not come to dine in,they only deliver.So because of Zomato and Swiggymany such kitchens have opened upwhere only the food is prepared,they have the right price and thenZomato and Swiggy take care of everything.They will give you packaging,they will of course give you delivery,they will do your marketingon their app, so on and so forth.So you can build a nice happy businesswhere you or maybe your parents knowhow to cook well, or you can hirea cook who you know makes amazing food,and then you can create this nicehappy local restaurant, which has noexpense of real estate, because it can bein any random room in a corner,of course, it needs to be a commercial place,you don't have to take a retail forefront,and you have the infrastructure in the formof Zomato and Swiggy that take careof most of the things.They take a good margin but if youhave the right cost, you can absolutelybuild the right kind of business.You can start a merchandising businesswhere you sell t-shirts, pens, mugs,there are many things which collegestudents really like, hoodies, at leastthey were very much in fashionduring our times, and almost all theenterprising students that I remember,they were friends that I had,they have been the owner of aT-shirt business at some or the other point.So it's something that a lot ofcollege students use to do in the past,I don't know if it is still happening or notbut if it is there, then you shoulddefinitely pick it up.And finally an affiliate businessIf you have a network, maybe of college students,maybe of friends and family,then you can become an affiliate partnerof Amazon or Flipkart, which meansif you share any link in your network,and then somebody buys anythingthrough that link on Amazon or Flipkart,then you get a percentage commissionas revenue. It's simple easy moneyand it's such a great way to make affiliateincome or a happy income as a college student.So, these were all the ideas buthere is the most important question.When you would be evaluating these ideas,the big decisions that you have to makeas a college student is, can I sparemy time or do I want to build an asset?This means that do I have the timewhich I'm ready to devote to this,but I know that I will keep earningtill I keep devoting my time to it,and the moment I stop giving it timemaybe my earning will also stop.For example, if you start a delivery networkand you are delivering yourself thenyou are renting your time,which means the day you cannot deliver,you will not earn anything,the day that you can deliver, you will earn.However, the second way of doingit is building an asset, which meanseven if you are sleeping,if you are in your class,if you are not doing anything,you are still earning.If you start a delivery businessbut instead of doing the delivery yourself,you have hired people who are deliveringfor you, that means you have built an asset.This means deliveries are happening evenif you are somewhere else and youdon't need to give your time to it.You started an affiliate business,whenever you are at any point in time,since you've already shared that linkand somebody is using it to buy something,then irrespective of what you are doing,you are still earning.It is very important to recognizethe difference between renting timeand building an asset. If you rent yourtime then you will definitely getinstant money, but that will be short-termmoney. If at some point you cannotgive it time, if your exams are going on,or your college has finished,or it is a stressful period,then your income will also stop.If you build an asset then you willnot get short-term money.Assets do not start making money right away.You will have to give a commitment of timebefore you start seeing money.So, if you want instant money in collegebecause your needs are like that at that time,then go for renting your time.But if you do not need money that much,then my suggestion absolutely fundamentallywill be to spend your time in building an asset.Try to build a business, or do somethingwhich is dependent on your skill,whether it is freelancing, coding, or academics,so that irrespective of where you are,what you are doing,you are still making money.I hope this was useful.Thank you so much for being patient.Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday,a new video at 9:30 pmPlease subscribe to the channel toget notified about those videos.This is Ankur warikoo, signing off!
