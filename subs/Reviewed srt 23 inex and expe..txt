Recently, my Kindlestopped working after 5 years.So, I bought a new Kindle which will be mentioned shortly,but along with that, I boughta Kindle cover as well,and I really lovedthis cover which said, âFinding joy in the journey.âwhich in some way isthe story of my life.âFinding the joy in the journey. The destination is a mystery.âThis is not availableright now on Amazon,but when I bought it,it was for â¹699and this is my next inexpensive purchase.Next, because I travel internationally, every country has a different socket,different plug point,different power supply. So, an international travel adaptor.I have used a lot of them in the last 10-15 years but this one hands down, is my favourite. We bought it this year and it works so well.There are two USB chargers as well. It's only,I wonât say only, but it costs â¹1,150but I can only believe that if youfrequently travel internationally,this can be a greatinvestment for you.I work on a desktop,and I use a mouse,and I love silent mouse.So, this silent mouseis my favourite.It is a Logitech device. Itâs called the Silent Plus Wireless Mouse. It is wireless andit is silent. It makes no noise.  It makes a faint sound. I donât listen intently to it, and itâs for â¹1,195.I went to the US atthe start of this year,and because many electronic itemsare cheaply available in the US, we bought this camera for Uzma.It costs $25,which is slightly less than â¹2,000 but itâs a great camera,particularly for kids. It has a small memory.It has some games.Of course, the quality is not goodbut it is more than enough for kidsbecause they get their own camera. They enjoy taking photos. It also has a selfie camerawhich is so interesting for them, and it has all of these templates.What are they called?Templates? Snapchat?Filters! Old guy. Boomer.Ankur, boomer uncle. It has many filters. So, it has these filters as wellwhich you can use, and itâs a great investmentfor a child if you wantto gift them a camera.So, these were theinexpensive things or giftswhich we bought this yearfor less than â¹2,000. You can choose one of them,and now begins the listof the expensive gifts.Number 1: Bosch Hand Tool Kit.I feel every householdshould have thisbecause we call aplumber or a carpenter oran electrician for anysmall inconvenience,and I feel that we can dealwith a lot of them on our own,but we were never taught about it. This toolkit is a good start for you to do that.It has many pieces.66 in number. Bosch is well-reputed German brand,and it is only for â¹2,052.Next expensive investment,HealthifyMe Smart Scale.So, it is a weighing scale,and using the HealthifyMe app,you can integrate it tomeasure all your vital stats.What is your body fat percentage? What is your muscle mass percentage? What is your bone density?What is your protein density?What is your metabolic age? So on and so forth.Of course, your weight,your metabolic age,your protein levels,body fat percentage,hydration levels,muscle mass, visceral fat,BMR, skeletal mass,all of these are criticalbody metrics to track.I use it every 2 weeks right now.Of course, I measure mybody weight every day,but these vital stats whichdonât move a lot every day, tracking them every 2 weeksgives me a nice happy lineand tells me whether I am progressing well towards my fitness goal or not.I bought a new smartwatchat the start of this year.Right now, and the irony of it all,it isnât working right now.So, the experience was good so far.The best thing aboutthe Titan smartwatch is its battery life. It lasts at least 7 days,and I use it for almost everything.So, I use it for my alarm,my sleep tracking.When I am playing in the morning,I use it totrack my steps,calories and everything.Of course, notifications are there,and itâs a good basic smartwatch. I wouldnât say the best but at this price, I felt, battery life included, and the Titan brand felt like a good purchase.I am happy with it but if the watch is not repaired,I have sent a videoregarding its malfunctionand their customerservice has not replied.If it comes, then I willwholly recommend it. If not,then maybe it wasan investment that didnât work,or it worked for at least 7-8 months.It should have workedfor a lot longer. An investment of â¹4,000.Next, UPS.There are power cutssometimes in the officebut I canât afford tohave my internet go down,I canât afford to havemy computer go down.So, a UPS for it.Itâs a great investment to make, and when I found this UPS from APC,after long hours ofresearch and review, I really liked it.Itâs 660W.1100VA power backup is there, which is enough. It lasts a long time.Power cuts arenât usually that longbut I wanted thatinvestment to come through,and itâs for â¹7,400.Next, Kindle.Just like I said,my Kindle stopped working.It worked well for 5 years.I genuinely sucked out its lifeand the money I paidfor it 5 years ago.So, it was the timeto buy a new one.So, I bought a newKindle for â¹8,000.I bought a new cover for it. I am happy.This is the 10th generation, which is the latest Kindle generation. It has Wi-Fi connectivity,a 6-inch display. Thatâs all I need.I donât like backlight. I often read at night,and the best thing I likeabout this Kindle is due to the e-ink in it,your eyes donât get tired.A thing about Kindle whichpeople donât know is thatwhen you buy a Kindle,buying books doesnâtbecome free for you.You will have to buy books as well.Often, the Kindle versionof books is cheaperthat paperback or hardcoverbut it doesnât meanthat they are free. So, a lot of people ask me to gift them a Kindle.I will gift it,but who will buy the books?If you donât have themoney to buy books,or the intent, then please donât buy a Kindlebecause it is abig one-time investmentfor you to make.Yes, you can get a Kindle forfree after watching this video.How?Just like I said,you have to subscribe to this channel to qualify for this giveaway.Choose one inexpensiveand one expensive item and comment it.And then, after two weeks, we will choose 5 winners who willget these 2 things for freehome-delivered to you. Next big investmentwhich we made 2 years ago but this time, we bought for a friend, and I really wanted to mention it. Nutribullet PRO Blender/Mixer/Smoothie maker. I make protein shakes in it.We make smoothies in it.Of course, a lot ofthings are blended in it.Nutribullet is a greatbrand for all of this.It is expensive. It cost us â¹8,500,but I felt it was awonderful investment to make,and we are thoroughly, thoroughly happy about it.A lot of videos are being made,in high definition, in 4k quality.Each video is about 4-8 GB,which naturally requireshard drive space.We upload almosteverything on Google DriveWe upload almosteverything on Google Drivebut it is also in therange of 10-20 TBs,and in the same investment, we couldhave purchased many more hard disks.So, we made an investment inthis hard drive of 5 TBs and it is for â¹11,299.If we look at GoogleDrive prices for the same,then we have recovered thisamount within 3 months, and now we have the videos in our hard drive as well for easy access for anyone in the team. Next, HP Laserjet.This was a brilliantpurchase this year for 2 reasons.I had Inkjet earlier. I donât know the reason for buying it. Itâs slow.It consumes a lot of ink.So, I needed a laserjet.I donât need colourprintouts right now.So, black-and-white printsare all that I need,and thatâs why itâs monochrome.Scanner/copier is agreat investment becauseall photocopies of any documentscan be done at home now. So, thatâs why we invested in it, and this is genuinely something thatwe are enjoying a lotand is recovering money for us. Itâs a little expensive. It cost us â¹18,500, but certainly something which you can use for more than 2-3 years, particularly if you frequentlyprint or scan or photocopy.Next, shoes.These are not normal shoes.These are worn by Djokovic.Asics is the brand,and these are my tennis shoes.This is a yearly investment because I play every day.My shoes wear out in a year. So, this investment every year,and I only buy thisbrand which is the FF3 Novak.Extremely amazing shoes.I genuinely feel a lot more athletic and in control on the court when I wear these.Of course, quite expensive. They cost â¹15,000,but certainly worth the investment.In my mind,can I invest â¹1,200 a month tobuy the best possibleshoes that I can afford?And the answer is YES.So, I will certainlymake that investment.And last big purchase, and this was a big one, was binoculars.We went to Kenya this year,and binoculars wereimportant for our tripbecause Masai Mara is a big jungle,and there are animalsat great distances. So, it may not be possiblefor you to see it through your phone.I did not take any high-end cameraor high-power lens with me because I just wanted to observe and absorb it.So, binoculars was agood investment to make. This is the Nikon Monarch M7.It has 10X magnification,and it has optical magnification. So, very, very high quality.For $496,which is almost â¹45,000.Starting from â¹100 up to â¹45,000, all my purchases of 2023 so far. Just like I said,two of these can be yours.One each from the inexpensiveand expensive lists.You have to choose them.
