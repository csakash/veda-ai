Awesome!I am going to Morgan speak to that camerabecause that's my main camera.So in case you don't find melooking into you,I'm still paying 100% attention.Awesome! Let me turn on.You look great, you sound greatand we are good to go.Awesome!On this edition of Money Talks,I have Morgan Housel,who is a partner at Collaborative Fund.But more importantly for me,and for most of you listening in,he is the author of the wonderfulbest selling book 'Psychology of Money.'It's such an honor to have youon this conversation, Morgan.Thank you for making time.Thanks for having me, Ankur.Happy to be here.Awesome!Let me get started with the question thatI ask every of my guests as the first one.How was it growing up,particularly when it comes to money?Did you grow up with a lot of money,without money?And how did that shape up your early yearswhen it comes to your relationshipwith money?Well, I think my upbringing wasa little unique in the sense thatI kind of saw both ends of it.My father started hisundergraduate college whenhe was 30 years old and had 3 kids.And that's when he started college.And then he became a doctor whenhe was 45 and had 3 teenagers.So he took this very interesting route.So my dad started undergraduate college,I think a month after I was born.And he became a doctor whenI was a teenager.So all through my early childhood,we had no money, nothing.My parents, we were completely broke.We qualified for the low income,free lunches at school, kind of thing.And then as I became a young teenager,my dad became a doctorand we had more money.Now, my parents were still very frugal,even after they started making more money.The frugality that was enforced upon themwhen we were broke,that kind of stuck around.So, even if they earned a higher income,we didn't spend a lot of money.We had a good life,we lived in a decent houseand we went on some moderate vacations,but nothing fancy, nothing flashy.It was a sense of frugality,the whole time.So that was my upbringing.And I tell the story of likeparticularly when I was a teenager,I looked down upon my parentsbecause I knew how much money they made,and I knew that we could be spending more,and they chose not to.And I had this feeling of like,I know you can drive a nicer car,I know we can live in a better house,I know we can go on fancy vacations,but we're not.And I don't appreciate it.That was my view at the time.And then there's this thing that happened.I'm pretty sure I've read about thisin the book.My dad was an ER doctor,emergency room, which is like,in my view, as stressful as it gets,because it's literally people dyingin front of you all day, every day,people dying in your arms.So he did that for 20 yearsor 25 years, and he burned out.He was just like, I've had enough.I've done enough of this.And he just quit.He just left one day.I mean not one day,it was a little bit planned,but it was not a part of his grand plan.I think he originally wanted to do itfor a little bit longer,but he got to a point wherehe was in his 60s, he just said,'I'm done with this, I'm out.'And I realized it was that moment whenhe was like, just at the very moment,he wanted to leave, he just left.And he could do thatbecause he had saved up so much money.And that was a big moment for meof being like, now I get it.I looked down upon you becausewe didn't drive a Porsche,but now I get it.You weren't spending that money so thatyou could control your time,so that the moment you were burned outfrom work, you just be like,'I'm out of here, I'm done.'And I saw how much happinessand pleasure it brought to my parents.And now they've been retired now for,I don't know, 5 years, maybe 10 years,something like that.And they're as happy as they've ever been,happy as they've ever been in their livesthat I've seen them.And they were able to do thatbecause they were so frugal.And my dad had all these colleagues,these other doctors,who earn the same amount of money as him,that did live in a big house,that did drive the Porsche,that did send the kids to private school,and they also want to quit.They're also burned out, and they can't.They got to keep working,keep working, keep working.They have no control over their times.That was probably the most definingstory of my childhood with money was like,was seeing that.The other thing that sticks out,I'll try to keep this short,was my first job.I was a valet at a fancy hotelstarting in Lake Tahoe,and then I moved to Los Angeles.But that was my first experienceof seeing very rich people,of these people driving into the hotelsin Aston Martins and Bentley'sand Rolls Royce and Lamborghini.I'd never seen that before.It was just like a different speciesthat I had seen.And they come in, I would just be like,'Wow, look at that!'And I had this feeling of like,I want to be that,the guy driving the yellow Ferrari,that's who I want to be.And it's funny now,because I don't want thatin the slightest anymore.But that was another defining momentof like, 'Oh, there's another levelof wealth that existsthat I did not know exists, and I want it.So that experience in my early 20swas pretty powerful as well.That is such a fascinating, incredibleanecdote man.Thank you for starting with that.And I'm fascinated about this experiencewhere your dad joined undergrada month into your world's existence.And then when you were a teenager,he became a doctor.That period would have been,as you also pointed out, difficult period.Did it make you hate money?Did that make you crave for money,become like this,I'm going to make so much money thatI don't have to ever go throughthis again?What was the overriding emotion?Well, I was so young, so think about thetime when my father was in medical school.My mom was in nursing schoolduring that period, I was age 5, age 10.From my experience,I had a great childhood,it was an amazing childhood.And we lived in a little apartment,and we went camping,and all of my clothes were handmedownsfrom my brother.But I was as happy as can be,and I think my brother and sisterwere as happy as can be too.So many people, like...How you feel about moneyis just your social comparison.It's not what do I have?It's what do I have relative tothat guy and that girl?That's how you measure it.And we lived in a communitywhen I was growing up,we lived in student housing.So everyone in our community,everyone in our apartment building wasin the exact same situation.It was students with children.We were all in the same situation.So everyone felt great,even if I look back on it, and it's like,'Oh, that was kind of rough.'We felt great at the time,especially because I was young.I didn't know any better.I think my parents, if you ask themat the time, they were like,really aspiring for a day when theyweren't cutting everything so close,when they had a little bit bufferand whatnot, and kind of like getting ridof the feeling that they are one mistake,one surprise away from catastrophe,getting rid of that,I think they really aspired to.My dad and my mom,they tell the story about,as my dad was wrapping up medical school,they still could not fathom a daywhen they would be making more money.I think they had just become so used tobeing broke that even thoughthey knew it was coming,they couldn't really fathom it.And when it started happening,they didn't really know what to dowith it.It was so accustomed to their lifestyleto be frugal and to be scraping by,that when it abruptly shifted,they didn't really know what to do.It was such a shock and a surprisewhen it happened.Wow!And I've heard you state this inconversations earlier thatit was somehow obvious to you,you wanted to do something in finance.Wasn't clear why, butthere was something in you that said,that's where I want to be.Where do you think that came from?Or was there something that was justa fascination early on and caught on?I think I knew exactly where it came from.It was being a valet at that hotelwhen I was 19 or 20,and seeing these rich peopleand being like,  I want to be that guy.And I started to get to know them,and a huge majority of themworked in finance.Like the people who came inin Rolls Royces and Ferraris,if you kind of have a chitchat with them,they'd be like,'Oh, I'm an investment bankerat Goldman Sachs.I work for private equity at bank.'That's what they all did.So I'm like,'Ok, well, that's what I want to do.'That was the whole inspiration.And I think it's funny now becauseI fell in love with finance.That was what pushed me through the door.But then I just really fellin love with the process of it.I think why I liked it was,at first, and to most people,it seems like a math-based field,and it's numbers and charts and dataand formulas,and if you're an analytically mindedperson, you're like, 'Oh, this is great.'I really quickly got over thatbecause I'm not reallyan analytically minded person.I'm not great with math and data.It's not really my thing.But I loved watching how peoplethought about money,and how they thought about theirsocial aspirations,and the guy driving the yellow ferrari,how he was trying to show offin front of everyone else,and how people were trying to climbthe social ladder,and the 'Psychology of Money'is really what I loved from the get go.I think a lot of this was becausemy first kind of introductioninto the stock market was the early 2000s,during the dot com bust, not the boom.During the boom,I wasn't paying any attention.I was too young, I didn't really care.But during the bust, 2001, that's whenI started getting interested in it.And so all these peoplewho I was looking at,including the peoplewho came into the hotel,were like, their portfolio was down80% in the past year.And watching how they justified thatand what that did to them,what that did to their psyches,was really fascinating.So, that was my first introduction.And then as I started getting really intoit, which is when I graduated college,I graduated in 2008,which is the financial crisis.And then so that's my other,like my professional entranceinto finance was,everything is collapsing.Everything is melting down.We're all broke.Nobody has any money anymore.And seeing what that did topeople's mindsets too, was like,'Oh, that's really interesting!'And I always think about that withmy own money too, for my wife and myself.Do we do calculations?Do we do forecast?Yeah, I guess to some degree, yes.It's not that we're oblivious tothe analytical side, but a huge majorityof what I think about for our own moneyis just like, how can we use thislittle pot that we haveto make us happier?It's not about making the spreadsheetshappy, it's not about like,oh, is this all maximizedaccording to Excel?It's just like, 'Are we happier?'Because if we have this,can this let us do somethingthat would make us happier?So even not just watching other people,but I think for us as well, it's justwhat's going on inside of our heads.Who cares about the spreadsheets?What's going on inside of here?That's all we care about.That's such an important point to makebecause we often just get lost in thatgrind where it's just money.Like one of my favorite questionsto ask people,especially when they're young is,have you ever sat down to calculatehow much money do you thinkyou will need in life to do all the thingsthat you want to do?It's crazy,most people don't even have that answer.It's like when you don't know thatanswer, you know what's going to happen?You're never going to stopchasing moneybecause you won't know when to stop.And let me give you likethat's a perfect analogy forif you imagine yourselfas hungry as you've ever been,just like, you haven't eaten today,and you just went for a 10-mile run,and you're starving, if I asked you,how much food would you needto satiate yourself?You could answer that.You would know, you'd be like,'Oh, if I was as hungry as I've ever been,if I had a plate of food that was this bigand this tall,I would be completely content.Everyone knows that.If I said, if you are as thirstyas you've ever been, how muchwater would you need to be satiated?You'd be like, 'Two glasses.'Even if I'm very thirsty,two glasses, I'm set.So people know those figures.If you ask them with money,it might be a million dollars,it might be $10 billion.They're so off about what they would need.So even if in other areas of life,they know what they need to be satiated,for money it's a complete blind spot.That's incredible!Did you have a figure growing upin your mind that you wanted to get to?Yeah, I think so.I remember being in college and thinking,if I had a hundred thousand dollars,all my problems would go away.But here's what's interesting.I think there was some truth to that,because I didn't say I would be content.I didn't say I'd be happy.I would say my problems would go away.And I think a lot of the problems of like,what happens if I lose my job?What happens if I need a new car?What happens if I get sick?I think at $100,000,a lot of those do go away.So you're not content.It's not that you don't aspire for more,but I do think that's kind of in my mind,that was a threshold of a stability,and I think that was kind of right.And now as the years have gone on,there are bigger numbers of, like,how much do I need to be content?And that's when everyone,including myself,tends to fool themselves.It's a much harder problem.I think my wife and I are pretty good atenough having like, being like,okay well, if we have this amount,then not much in our life changesafter that.If we gain more from that,not much is good.We're going to live in the same house,same car, same clothes.But it's hard for everyone, I think,to totally get the goal postto stop moving.And that gets back to, like I said,social comparison.For most people, once you earn more moneyor you have a higher net worth,you tend to shift your gaze outward.And before you are comparing yourselfto this person,and now once you surpass that person,you start comparing yourselfto that person.You just keep looking at other people.I think that goes on forever.You can imagine someone who's worth$10 billion like,unfathomable to me and you,and they're looking at Elon Musk,who has $250 billion.So you just keep shifting your gazeto somebody else,and that's why it's so hard to getthat goal post to stop moving.So get that, man!You've mentioned your wifequite a few times, and I do believethat a large part of how you thinkabout money is alsohow your life partner thinks about money.And it's very rare to findsome sort of symmetry,some sort of synthesis around that.Is that something you guys have worked on?It just happened,and that's why you're together.I think there is a lot of luck in that.We haven't worked on it.We don't have a budget.We've been together for 16 years,and there's never been any sort offinancial disagreement in the slightest.Even before we were married,we merged our finances,and it was just like,there's never been an issue.I think part of that, my wife isan extremely competent,smarter person than me,but she has completely delegatedfinancial decisions to me.It's not that she's not involved,but just in terms of how we invest,how we allocate, how much cash do we want?That's a 100% me.And maybe that's why that I thinkit's not that she doesn't care,it's not that she's not capable,that's not it, it's just like...I think some of these thingsdo get a little bit easier if one personis delegated as the big decision maker.And that's kind of hard becausethere should be total equality.This is our money,and these decisions affect her as much,if not more than they affect me.But I think there are a lot of thingswhere it's like decisions get easier,particularly decisions where there'sno one right answer.It's kind of a fuzzy areaand what's the right thing to do?Like, you could do this,you could do that, doesn't matter.They get a lot easier when there'sone person who's making the big decisions.And I think a lot of financialdisagreements among couples are whenyou've equality among decision makers,and there's no one right answer.It's not two plus two equals four.It's like, you could go this way,you could go that way,and you have the husband and the wifewho want equal say in it,and there's no one right answer.That's when it's like youget these perpetual disagreements.That could be the source of a lot ofheartache.Yeah, it could be.And also, as parents, I'm curious,how are you even thinking,if at all you're thinking that your kidsshould have a sound awareness ofwhat money is,particularly around the psychology of it?Are you doing something specificallyto hone that, or is it somethingthat you believe will happen on its own,naturally?I think we have to let ithappen on its own because,so I'm the youngest of three,and my brother and sisterand I all ended up so different,and we have the same DNA,the same parents, the same upbringing,and I went this way, and my sister wentthat way, my brother went that way.We all love each other, we all get along,but we're very different people for, like,how we think about and you have moneyand other things in life, totally.And I think every parent,I think my microphone, sorry about that.What happened here?It stopped recognizing my microphone.It okay.Are we back?Yeah, we're back.Okay, let me start that over.Sure.And every parent, I think,assumes that their children,if they have multiple children,will end up kind of the same,because they're raising them the samewith similar values, but there'sso much evidence that they don't.And so how am I going to teach my kids,who are aged 3 and 6 right nowabout money, when I have no ideawho they're going to be as adults?It might be that my son wants to work forGreenpeace, and my daughter wants to bea partner at Goldman Sachs.You have no clue where they're goingto end up.So I think the more you try to regiment itand be like, I'm going to teach you X, Yand Z, the more it gets difficult,especially because kids when they areteenagers, have a natural tendencyto rebel.So if I sit them down and say,Here's what you need to do withyour money, here is the right thing to do,naturally they're going to say, okay,I want to do the exact opposite of that.So I think the best that we can doas parents is trying to lead by examplebut not by force.And just be like,'Hey, this is what your mom and I dowith our money and maybeyou might learn from that.If you want to do something different,that's up to you.'I'll give you an example.My parents have been vegetariansfor 45 years and when myselfand my brother and sister were growing upat around age ten,because we were raised vegetarian,because that's what my parents ate.But around age ten my parents said,'Hey, this is what your mom and dad do,this is why we do it,if you want to do something different,100% up to you.If you want to eat meat,totally up to you, no problem at all.We'll even buy it for you if you want it,no problem.'So I think that of leading by example,of being like, this is what we do,and here's why we do it,but you want to do something different,no problem.Now, there are some limitations to that.If my kids say I want to go intoa huge amount of margin debtand day trade penny stocks,I might push back a little bit.So I think there are some things,but I think the best that I want to do isjust lead by example, of being likeand what is the example?My wife and I havea very high savings rate.We don't spend a lot of money.We try to use money to gaincontrol over our time and independence,so that we can have the flexibilityto work in a job that we like,live in a location that we like,take a lot of time off to do whatwe want to do with our friends and family.That's the example we want to set forth.But I would not be surprisedif ten years from now,when my kids are teenagers,I've never sat them down, and said,'Here's how to think about money.'They have never had a lecture,but I hope they would know a lotabout money just through osmosis ofwatching this.Yeah, kids are beautiful animalsof just replication.And as much as we do a good job ofteaching them, as you said, by example,they will pick up the right examplesfor themselves.It's fascinating to see them grow.How does your usual day look likenow that you're working more and moretowards getting your money to workfor you, to give you access aroundyour time, make it more free for you?What's your daily routine look like?I don't think it's changed that much.I don't think it's changed at allbecause all I've done for my entire careeris trying to do a lot of reading,and tried to do a lot of thinkingand going for walks and talking to people,trying to figure out how other peoplethink about money and how other peoplethink about what's going on in the worldand trying to create a story around thatthat I can share with people.That's what I've done since college.And that's what I will continue to dofor probably the rest of my career.That's just what I enjoy doingbecause it doesn't feel like work.I really enjoy doing it.And so, not much has changed in terms ofhow I structure my day.And I don't think it ever really will.And that's how I want it.I just want to keep it as simple as I can.And even as my income has grownover the years, not much has changedin terms of how we live.We live in the same house,and drive the same car,and wear the same clothes.Like there have been some littlesubtle shifts here and there,but nothing too dramatic.And I hope it stays like that, too.I hope that 20 years from now,we're roughly living the same lifeas we are right now.Because if your income growsbut your spending doesn't,most of the time, what that means is thatyou find your pleasure doing things thatdon't cost a lot of money.You find your pleasure by going for walks,and talking with your friends,and going for hikes, and reading a book,that don't cost that much, if any money.And I think when people,their income grows, and they go outand buy the massive mansion,and the Ferrari, and the diamonds,most of the time, not all the time,I don't want to generalize here,but a lot of the times, that's covering upa weakness, or it's just fooling yourselfto being like, if I hada diamond necklace, I'd be happier.And maybe for some peoplethat is the case.Just because that's not true for me,maybe for some people it is.I don't want to pass too much judgment,but I think a lot of the times,it's covering up a social weakness whereyou want to show the world thatyou're somebody who you're not,or you want to show the world likeyou want to cover up your lack ofpersonality with diamonds, literally.So I hope it doesn't fallinto some different material trap.I hope 20 years from now, still livingroughly the same life that we are now.Do you recall a time, Morgan,when you began to realize these things?Was it more because you began to reada lot more, write a lot more.Like, at what point in time did you seethis level of wisdom coming inand becoming apparent as the truthfor yourself?My wife had this comment the other day,and she said it kind of tongue in cheek,like she wasn't being serious.We acknowledge people's suffering duringthe recession, but she said,she's happier during a recession,or during a big market decline becauseKeeping up with the Joneses Effectdiminishes, and the social comparisondiminishes,whereas versus during the bull market,when everybody's rich,there's so much pressure to keep upwith the people who bought the nicer houseand the people who havethe fancier clothes.You kind of feel likeyou are a little bit below them.And so I bring that up becausewhen did these feelings start?For me, I think it startedwhen I graduated college in 2008,and the world was falling apart,and everyone was broke, so to speak.And that was a period where it was like,hey, people don't have a ton of money,but you can prove your worth in the worldand be nice to your friendsand gain friendships by going for a hikewith your friends.You don't need to go toan expensive restaurant,you can go for a hike with them.You don't need to go on a fancy vacation.You can go kayaking in the local lake,and have a great time with your friends.I think that was what was forced upon usand our friends in 2008,and to me, that was just like,hey, I think we're actually happierdoing that than we were in 2006,when we were all trying to impresseach other with the fancy clothes.We're happier now, going for a hikethan we were going to a fancy restaurants.So can we just keep doing that?Even when the economy rebounds,let's keep going for the hike insteadof the fancy restaurant,let's keep doing that.I think that's where it came from for me.That's beautiful!That's so beautiful!Tell me, how do you invest your moneynow that you're not just investing yours,but the entire family is also on you?How do you think about investing itfor the short-term, mid-term, long-term?Nothing's really changed in terms ofhow we invest.Hasn't really changed in a decade.I've been investing pretty much the exactsame, which is I'm a passive investor.It's not a 100% passive,I own some shares.I'm on the board of directors of Markel,so I own some Markel stockand some Berkshire Hathaway stock,and I own maybe like,three or four different index fundsthat I have, internationaland value and whatnot.So it's become very slightly more complexover the last couple of years,but it's pretty much the same.The huge majority of our net worth isthis house, a checking account,and index funds.That's like the huge majorityof what we have.It's been like that for a long time.I suspect it'll be like that for a while,because all I want to focus on for ourinvestments is endurance and longevity.I don't want to ask the question,how can I earn the highest returns?I want to ask,can I earn pretty good returnsfor the rest of my life?Can I earn pretty good returnsfor 50 years?And if I can do that,the results are going to be crazy good.And then, so when my finances arethat simple too, it's so basic,and there's nothing to do.I don't need to track anything,I don't need to change anything,then I can spend all of my timedoing things that I like,hanging out with my family,and also focusing onmy financial psychology of like,do I have the mindsetto actually stick around,and endure bearing markets and recessions,and surprises for the next 50 years?That's why I keep it that simple.So it's been like that for a while,and I think it probably will too.It's just as brainless as I can make it.And has any of your writing andany of your reading materially changedany of the investment piecesthat you had for your own self or perhapshad you reconsider it,when have you strongly changedyour point of view that you have held onfor a long time?Well, it hasn't been for a while,but when I was younger,I started out investing day tradingpenny stocks.That's how I started when I wasa teenager.I think that's how most people startbecause it seems intuitive thatthat's how you can make the most money.It's totally wrong.That's how most people started,that's how I started.And then I got into like,picking small cap stocks,and then picking large cap stocks.I tried everything.I was trading options at one point.I tried everything.And during those periods,it's not that I thought,oh, this is the best way to do it.It was just like, I don't know,this seems kind of fun.I was young, I was 18,I was 19-21, that kind of age.And it seemed like that wasthe right thing to do.So I've changed a lot since then,but it's been a while since I've hada full blown, like,we should do something different.I'll tell you one,maybe a slight example of that,it was that we moved into this house2 years ago, a little over 2 years ago,and this house was 50%over our budget at the time.50% more!Not a little bit more, but 50%!And we found this house, and we're like,I think we're going to be happierin this house than the othersthat we're looking at.I think it's going to be a totallydifferent lifestyle for the betterfor us and our kids, and I thinkwe could stay in this house for 50 years.And so, it was hard for me to swallow.For someone who's always been kind ofbudget conscious and pretty cheap,and for someone who's not stretched,it was hard to swallow at the time,and I had a couple of sleepless nights.But I'm so glad we did it!So I think that's important thatwhen you have a frugal mindset,that on occasion, you are able to look ateverything in totality and say,this one time, I'm going to splurgebig time on this thing,and it's going to make me happier.It's not because I'm going to show it offto my friends.It's not because people are goingto think I'm cooler.It's like, this is going to make my kids'and my wife's and my life better,and therefore I'm going to splurge.I think a lot of people who are notable to do that,they just get stuck in the frugal mindsetforever, for everything,and are never able to realizewhen you can use money to treat yourselffor a better life.I think those people can be a little bitjust kind of stuck in a depressivegray zone.My parents too,for all of their frugalityand where that brought them to,they know how to, once in a while,write a big check for somethingthat's going to make them really happy.So it's important to do that.And that's one thing that, I don't know,if that was a change in my mindset,but at the time,it felt like I was breaking awayfrom the foundations that I had.But in hindsight, I'm like,that was one of the best thingsthat we did.Good for you, man.I'm so happy for you for that.I want to switch gears, Morgan,and talk about your writing,something that I've been fascinated withfor a really long time.Long before your book came in,I've been following it,and that was largely around,I think, 2016, when I discovered youon the Collaborative Fund blog.One, I was mesmerized by the consistencywith which you were writing becausethis wasn't like, Seth Godinshort form come out every day.You were writing deep, meaningful,insightful stuff every week,and just churning it out like a robot.And I know that you've been writingbefore that, so this wasn't somethingthat you just picked up, but was this likea commitment you madethat I want to be consistent?Is that something that comesnaturally to you?Is this something that youforce upon yourself?How does that process work for you?And why did you choose that processin the first place?Well, before 2016, when I joinedCollaborative Fund,I was at the Motley Foolfor almost 10 years.And at the Motley Fool,particularly in my early years,you mentioned not the short formdaily stuff.In my early years in Motley Fool,I was writing 3 articles a day, every day.And I did that for years,years and years and years,and they weren't any goodbecause I was doing it so quickly.It was just, I would wake up every morningand be like,okay, I need to churn this out.I got to get it done.But I think what that taught me iswhen you write that much,3 articles a day, every day for 7 years,anyone who does any task that muchwill figure outhow to do a better job at it.It was such repetitionand so much volume that I feel likeI figured out what writing worksand what doesn't.I always wanted to have this thing of likeit was less about is this article quality?It was more of like,is this idea timeless?So I had this idea thatif an article that I write,is not relevant a year from now,then it's not relevant today.If it's not relevant 5 years from now,it's not relevant today.And that was just like my time horizonas an investor.I'm going to be investing forthe next 50 years.So if I'm writing an articlethat's only relevant for the next week,it's about Microsoft quartetly earningor soemthing,then I don't care about it at all.So rather than consistent quality,I wanted to be consistent, timeless,timelessness.That's always been something thatI've kind of striven for.The other thing is, when you writeon the Internet, you know this too,for all forms of content on the Internet,people are so impatient,that if you don't catch their attentionin 2 seconds, they're gone,they have clicked away,they're somewhere else,they're onto the next Tweet,onto the next reel, whatever it is.So that really forces you as a writerto be succinct,and to get people's attention,and to strip away all the fluff,as much fluff as you can from the writing,and be like, I just want to makemy point, and get out of your way,because if I don't do that,you're going to leave anyways.So I might as well just likepitch you really quickly.If you always have that in your head whenyou're writing how impatient people are,it forces you to become a much cleaner,more succinct writer.Yeah, I so get that and completely agree.One of my favorite articlesthat you've written was I believe in 2016,which was, 'What a Time to Be Alive?'And it's something that I've alwaysbelieved in because we're living in thisculture where everyone believesthe world's rotten,and is only going to get worse.And it's really hard for youto abstract yourself, get yourself toa 10,000ft level,dissociate your individuality withwith how the world is experiencing itself,and then see the world for whatit's going through.And there were two thingsthat stood out for me.One was the resonance of the idea itself,which was like,hey, there's someone else who thinks,and there are so many others who have,but this was like a financial writerwho is writing about something whichis just general, but to the amount ofresearch that you had done toelaborate and emphasize on that point.And my question, I guess, is,I'm sorry, I'm being disrespectfulby asking this question firstly.Do you do that research all on your ownevery single time?Is there somebody helping you do that?No, that's all, I'm a one-man showto that point. I learned many years ago,and I'm not proud of this,but I can do good work,but I'm not a good employee.I'm not good with teamwork.I'm not good with joint projects.I'm not good with collaboration.Again, I'm not proud of that fact.But I just accepted it many years agothat I can really only workif I'm a one-man show.I think that's because writing is an art,and in art, there's no right answer.So whenever I write an article,I have a long history of not working wellwith editors, because I would write myarticle and I would like it,and I'd give it to an editor,and they'd say,I don't like that paragraph,change this, rework this.And I'd be like,no, I don't care if you don't like it.I like it.It's my damn article.So you go write your own.That's how I always viewed it.And so, all that stuff is kind of alone.Now, when I say alone,you have to realize that,where am I getting these ideas?Where am I getting this inspiration?Well, I spend 90% of my time readingother people, so even if I'm not writingwith them, I'm reading their work.And when I read something, I'm like,oh, that reminds me of this.And that prompts me to go research moreabout this.And you wrote this, butthis person wrote something different.Where do they overlap?So it's never a solo projectin the sense that every writer is gettingtheir ideas from somebody else.Every person is getting...Nobody really has any independent thought.Everyone is just readingand thinking about what they've seen,what they've heard elsewhere,and trying to contextualize itthrough the lens of their own life.So the writing is solo,but the thinking is very much,is very much not.That's how I've always thought about it.That's incredible, man!So admirable!I was genuinely blown away.I was like, yeah! You've grown up reading,Hans Rosling and Factfulness, and so on,so you get that drift.But then for somebody to go through, like,I don't know, 35 bullet points of justemphasizing the fact that we're just,like, literally less than 100 years apart.But this is the kind of lifethat was there back in that century.This is the kind of life we have here.What a time to be alive?I appreciate it.And there's some of that, too,where it's like, you'd be surprisedhow easy it is to find that information.So if you're sitting at your desk,and you're like,how much have car accident fatalitiesdeclined in the United Statesin the last 100 years?In 10 seconds on Google,you can find that data.And it's very clean data.It's apples to apples.So a lot of that where it seems like,man, how did you find that?Google!It takes 2 seconds to find all that.If you just have a little bit ofcreativity like, okay, so thenhow much has childhood mortality declined?How much has smoking cigarette deathsdeclined?All that data exists really easilyfor free.So a project like that isa lot of fun to dig through.It's really not that much work.Tell me about the book writing experience.Was that something which was a differentproject from your regular writing work?Because I didn't see you take any breaks,and boom, you come up with another book.While I do see the book to bea beautiful mirror image ofa lot of the blog posts in general,so there is clearly a lot oftransferable work that's happened.But was that like a separate project,or how?No, not really.I mean, not everybut the majority of chapters in the bookwere at least inspired from a previousblog post that I had written,some of which I wrote ten years ago.And some of them are likereally inspired to you.I mean, some of them are pretty muchfrom an old blog post that I wrote.And I think that was really importantbecause as a writer, even doing thisfor a long time,I'm sure you would say the same.It's never really clearwhat's going to work,and what's going to resonate with people.When I write an article,I still don't have a really good idea of,is this good or not?I still don't know.Even after doing this for so many years,there's times when I write an article,I'm like, this is good,this is going to be the one,and nobody likes it.And there's other times where I'm like,I'm embarrassed to publish this article.I think this is so banal and dry,and then people love it.So you never have a clue.And so what is really important iswhen I sat down to write the book,I was like, let me pick topicsthat did resonate with people,that I know people liked.They were already tested in a blog post,okay, I know people like this topic.I frankly didn't think it was that good,but other people liked it.Apparently this caught on with them.So let's use that topic for a chapter.So those big ideas,the big structure of the book waskind of already done from blog post.It was kind of already set up.So that made the process much easier.And then it was using the bonesof old blog posts to be like, ok,how can I turn this into a book chapter?Now, I started off that processdoing it all wrong.I started off by saying,ok, most of my blog posts are a 1000 wordsand in a book an average chapteris 5,000 words.So let me try to write a bunch of5,000 word chapters,because that's what most books are.And I started doing that,and it did not go well.It really didn't go well.I had a year to write the book,and after ten months, this is true,after ten months,I had two really shitty chapters,neither of which ended up in the book.That was after 10 months of working on it,because I was trying to reinventthe writing process.I was trying to be like,ok, normally I write blogs,and now I'm writing a book,I've got to blow it up and reinvent it.And I didn't have that skill.I just wasn't really good at thatlong term writing.So out of desperation, in the end,I was like, you know what, screw it!I'm going to write a bookof blog posts, basically.And so the average chapter in the bookis like 2,500 words.So it's a long blog post,but it's much shorter thanan average book chapter.And there's a couple of chapters in therethat are like one page, two pages,those are blog post lengths.And I just accepted,but not in a happy way,in a kind of like,I'm disappointed in myself way.I'm like, all I know how to dois write blog post length work.And so that's what I'm going to do.And I know peoplearen't going to like that.A lot of people are going to say,this isn't a book,it's a collection of blog posts.But so be it.That's what I know how to do.That was my feeling at the timewhen I wrote it.And I think in hindsight now,it's been out for almost two years now.I think it was a strength becausemost topics do not require 5,000 wordsto explain.I use this point of like,the Declaration of Independencein the United States is 4,000 words,one of the most important documentsin the history of Western civilization.It's like a couple of pages.And so, if you can writethe Declaration of Independencein 4,000 words,don't tell me that you need 7000 wordsto explain how to save your money,you don't.So I was like, look,if I can explain these topics in1,500 words, and then be done with it,and let you move on to the next chapter,that's what I'm going to do.And I think that's one of the waysthe book distinguishes itself.It's like, I try to make minimal fluff.I'm not going to say there's no fluff,but I try to make it as minimalas possible.I try to just make my point and get outof your way,and move on to the next chapter.And I think that's whata lot of people like about it.That's awesome, man!Now I have to say thatthat is indeed a strength.When you pick up a book on money,you're expecting long chapters,you're expecting terminologies,complexities, and in almost a rude manner,the author to say,Hey, if you don't get it, you're not fitfor this book,so you might as well drop it.But there are very few money booksthat are inviting,and that becomes a rewarding journey.Psychology of Money is,hands down one of them. Great!We're nearing the end Morgan,so I want to have a rapid fire,5 questions, whatever comes to your mindfirst, and that'll be a closeand a wonderful one at that.Number one, if you had to pick betweenmoney and power,what would you pick Morgan?Money, for sure, money, 100%!Awesome!If you had to pick betweenspeed and perfection?Oh, God, that's good!That's a really tough one.Probably perfection.But I'm like, 51-49 on that answer.I can sense that!Hand on heart, how many copies did youthink 'Psychology of Money' would sellwhen you wrote that?Our first print run was 5,000, in my head,because we thought that'sprobably pretty good.In my head, I thought, if this getsto 25,000, that is a massive success.And I had these dreams of maybe inan alternative universe,we could get to 100,000.And I think next month we'll hit2 million.2 million! Oh, my God!That is unbelievable. Awesome, man!I love that!I give you two choices, Morgan.One is to take $100 million right now,or two is to go back to you, when you were20 with everything that you know today.This is another really hard one.These are great!If we're just talking aboutthe financial context,because if I went back to when I was 20,will that mean I have to give upmy wife and kids?Because I don't want that.We're just talking to financial context.I'd still probably take a 100 milliontoday because that's a shitload of money.Now, if you said a million dollars today,or everything back to when I was 20,although if we're really going to playthis game accurately, and I can go backback to when I was 20, and I still knowwhat stocks are going to do well,and what lottery numbers to pick,then I would do that too.But I have very little FOMO,and I have very little regretof not buying the right stocks.And even when I talked aboutmaking the mistakes of day trading stocks,I don't regret that in the slightest'cause it was a great learning experience.So even when I look back and say,oh, if I could go back and do itall over again, there's a big part of methat's like, I don't want to do itall over again.Even the things I did wrong,I think were great experiencesthat I remember fondly.Awesome, man, love that! Final question.What do you think would be the mostexpensive purchase you're made till now?I think maybe the decision to send ourkids to private school,which they are not,they're in public school right now.But if we made that decision,that would probably be right up there.And I have no idea whether we will,but that would be private schoolin the United States.I'm sure sending there is crazy expensive!So if you make that decision,that's a very big commitment for two kids.That is! That was awesome!Other than that, there's really nothing inour lifestyle that I could seechanged materially.Evident from the conversation,and I love the contentment, it shows!It just shows in the conversation as well.Brilliant, Morgan!It was so much fun to have this,and I'm so glad that we couldmake it happen.I wish you the best!Please continue with all the work thatyou're doing, it helps a lot of peoplethat you perhaps may never get tohear from,but as a representativefrom the other side of the world,thank you for the book.Thank you for your writing,thank you for your thoughts.Thank you, this has been fun, thanks!Awesome, super!Thank you so much.I just noticed you can probably see,I'm using our corporate account,so it says Craig Shapirofor my name down here.I just saw that,I'm like, oh, man, that sucks.I need to log back into mypersonal account, but hopefully thatdoesn't screw up your editing process.No, it doesn't, it won't,don't worry about it.Thank you so much for doing this, man.I am glad we were on time.And all the best with everything!Thanks, man, appreciate it,take care, stay in touch.Take care. Bye.
