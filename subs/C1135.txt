Check. One, two.Hey, everyone and welcome back tothe Complete Guide to Studying Abroadpowered by Leverage Edu.This is a three part series,in which I'll let you know every stepthat you need to knowif you wish to study abroad.It could be the US, UK, Australia, Canada,Ireland, any place in the worldfor your Bachelors, for your Masters,for your MBA.Anything that you want to do.This is going to bethe comprehensive guidethat will teach you everythingthat you need to know.In the first video, if you haven't checkedthen please do check out.We covered the two fundamental aspectsof preparing for studying abroad.The very first,that what country you want to go to,and what course do you want to doafter going there.And for that,What are the exams that you need toprepare for and how do you go aboutselecting and preparing for those exams?Once we're done with that comesthe meaty part, the application process.And as I have told you,The application processof International University's isvery different from whatwe are used to in India.In India, mostly there are entrance exams.Where we sit,there's an exam for 2-3 hours.You do whatever you know quickly.And then you get a big rank.According to our rank, if it's good,then we'll get good streams in counsellingwe'll get good college.If not, then, not so good streams,not so good colleges,and God forbid,if we don't get any rank,Then we have to keep giving the test.and that's the way it is,what it misses, which I love aboutinternational universitiesbecause it covers that.It's that what's your personalityand what are your reasons to study?with what clarity are you approachingthis university or degree,and that is something which is sodifferent about international application.I remember, when I started applyingfor my US degree,in the first month, my mind got blown awaythat there were a lot of things,which comprise the application process.The most important thingis something called SOP. Sorry.The most important thing is somethingcalled SOP, Statement Of Purpose.A lot of people, miss this.Statement Of Purposeis exactly what it soundsyou have to write, in essay format,that why do you want to study this degree?And that is so hardbecause we don't know,most of us don't even knowwhy we want to do it.For us, it's like we've finished ourBachelor's, now I have to do my Master'sif not Master's, we have to do MBA,for a job or something.For us, to articulatethat what was in our mind,what is our vision, what is our purpose,is a really hard thing to get done,and that is the first,and perhaps a most meaty componenton the application.Then comes LOR, Letters Of Recommendation.So, international universities say,that whatever you are saying,it's you who is saying.And you'll, of course, say good things.We also want to hear from the peoplewho had already worked with you.who know you very well.That what would they tell about you.How do they look at you?And they will then have questionsfor these recommendees.And if we do it rightfully, thatdoesn't happen always,but if you do it rightfully,then this is a very secret process.You, as an applicant, can't know,that what did your reccomendeewrite about you?You're technically not allowedto view that. As I saidit doesn't happen everytime.Because lot of times the recommenderwould be like, send a draft of anything,I will look at it,make edits if I want to and then use thatas the base which is also fine by the waybut it doesn't remainas secret as it should be.So that is the second thingthen the third thing issomething called transcripts.We are very used to Mark sheetsand report cards,because it's like this in India.but outside, it's transcripts.Meaning of transcripts isyou will have a full viewof what course have you takenin each semester.What was the maximum percentageor grade of it?How much did you get?And that is like, a whole detailed viewof your entire schoolor college performance.So that's called a transcript.And these transcripts, most universitiescould give, because now they've gottenso used to their students applyingfor international universitiesbut you have to ask for it.We don't get these,we usually get Mark sheets.Mark sheets are semester based,or yearly based.There was this exam in this semester,I got these many marks, that's it.Transcript like this full viewof the entire degree.And finally is financial aid application.Financial aid is very important.Because international educationis very costly.And there are different types ofFinancial aids.When I applied in the US,there was clarity,that there is no waywe can afford a US education.From a very humble middle class family,in fact, we were in debt our whole lives.So, the status was such thatthat we'll reach the US.But, not so much that we would be ableto study in the US.And that is why this scholarshipof the financial aid was so important.Because I was applying for a PhD program,we used to get two types of aids.One which is called teaching assistantshipand second which is calledresearch assistantship.Teaching assistantship is you'll teacha class with a professor.And this is usually anundergraduate class, because you area master's, a PhD student.So it is expected that you already knowall that they are now learning.So you will be like a cheap resourcefor teaching an undergraduate classwho is just as capable if not good.So, I used to take a lab classof second year students in engineering.And in that lab class,astronomy or astrophysics,whatever things they wanted to learn,I used to teach themTo do that,I had 100% tuition fees waiver.That means I don't haveto pay any tuition fees.And on top of that,I got $1,500 every month as stipend.Which I could use for my expenses.That is the way I funded my education.So need based, performance or merit based,all of these are there.Leverage Edu, in fact, helps tremendouslystudents to get this financial aid.They even give their own scholarship,up to seven lakh rupees which is a lot ofmoney and God bless them for doing this.But, that is assistance thatI would certainlyask you to take for, in fact,for the whole application,because as I said the application processis very unique and differentfrom the Indian way of applyingfor colleges and universities.We need art to understandthat in this University, this country,what things I can say,what things I can show,what things I can make,to increase your chances of applicationor shortlisting.That is how they function.So Leverage Edu can be greatfor that counselingfor that application supportthat you would needto go through this entire pieceonce you have finalized the countryand the course that you want to go for.Once you've done that,if everything is over...Sorry.One thing that is very important,then you will have to be very clearthat how many universitiesare you applying in?For you to have the maximum probabilityof getting an admission.Like, in the last videoI showed you an AI course finder,which is from Leverage Edu,which is a very simplebut very smart tool to shortlistthe kind of universitiesyou should be applying for.So, it will shortlist three categoriesof universities for you.Your dream universities,where you should definitely apply for.These are the top ranked universitiesand for what you want to dothey'll be the best places to go,reach universities which are likesomewhere in the middle,ranking is good, but your chances ofgetting through are also good.and then safe universitieswhere your chances of getting throughare very high.But, they may not be as goodas you would want them to be.and a smart student will be like, I'll,apply in the three of them.I may not apply in the same amountin all the threebut I'll say that if I...want to apply in five universities,so I will apply, two universitiesin my dream, two in my reachand one in the safe.So, that God forbid, if anything happens,so, I'll get an applicationin the safe university, at least.There is a lot in reach too.I need to aim towards dream university.This is how you would do it.And it's also important to notea lot of universities,especially US universities,do have an application fee when you apply.So it's not entirely cheapto go through these applications.So, it's not like, hey,why to apply for five?We can apply to 50.If you have to pay $100in every university, to apply.Then you don't want to begoing through that kind of expense.So, you have to limit plus,as I've said, to applyto every university is a lot of work.You need to customize your SOP a lot,You have to personalize it a lot.Every university has a different viewto measure these things,there's a different experience to do it,they look at Indians in a different way,they look at Indians within the course.So, it's very important that all of thesenuances that we don't know about.You get through an expertlike Leverage Eduand use their helpto make sure that that is there.How to write LOR?How are transcriptssupposed to be in form?How to write the applicationsfor financial aid correctly?If you have to submit you financial proofsthat you have to do, becauseit's quite possible thatfinancial aid won't cover100% of the fees.So, you will have to showthat you have a bank balance of this much.you have these many assets,you have capabilityto sponsor this education yourself.Or to fund.And that is all work, you will have to dofor every University.So, it's not even possiblethat you would do it for 10, 15 or 20.unless you're doing a horrible jobof all of that.Once you've gone through all of this,the final thing, if you've done it right,is that you will get an interview call.Interview call, it isn't necessary,that every university has it,Every country, every universityhas a different approach.I remember I got an interview call.And there was a moment of immense pride.I got an email from this professor calledprofessor D. beers. Actually, sorry,it wasn't D. beers,his name was Doctor Beers.We used to call him D. Beers.His name was Dr. Beers, Dr. Timothy Beers.He sent me an email.I used to have an email addressof hotmail, then.That I would love to speak to you.We only used to have landlines, then.So, you had to be very clear thatwhen is the call happening?What was it?There was no Zoom at that time.There was no mobile phone,this was in 2001.And he called.He asked me why I wanted to do this PhD.What is it that I wanted to do afterwards?About my upbringing, about my experienceas a bachelor's student.And then at the end of it,he was like, okay,I think we are ready to make you an offer.And please wait for the acceptance lettercoming from our side very soon.And that was so good.It was just so good.That moment was perhaps one of thethe best moments of my life.I cut the phone, I went to my parents,I said that theytechnically, verballysaid that my admission is done.And I could see thatthis was like the escapefor our entire family.Such a family, that hadseen many difficulties,they had gone througha lot of financial distress.Would now see their firstborn childgo out of the country,get a fine education,get paid for that education,and hopefully changethe destiny of their family.And I can't beginto tell you that feeling.I would love for all of youto have that feeling.I would love for all of you toexperience that once in your life andfor those who have alreadygone through it.You know what I'm talking about.Where you got throughyour dream company,you got through your dream college,you got through your dream exam, anything.And that moment you knew would be momentthat will hopefullychange your life forever.And that's the same thingthat happens when you getthat admit in an international university.So, this interview preparationis very important too.Very different approaches are followedby very different company. Sorry.Very different approachesare followed by universities.For MBA, especially,I know US universities tell their alumnusin that country to takean interview directly.Because, they trust alumnus,so, the top tier colleges in the US,if you get shortlisted,you will almost always face an alumin your city or in your country.A lot of people make Zoom calls now.They just want to make sure thatthe person who appliedwho wrote statement of purpose,through whom lettersof recommendation came in,who applied for that financial aid,who sent those transcripts,who sent all those documents,if that person really is that person,who he or she claims to be.And that's largely the purpose of aninterview. In this interviewthere is not much of technical evaluation.But very personal questions are asked.It's a personal evaluation of who you are.Why do you want to come to this place?How do you intend to make the most of it?What do you intend to do after it?So on and so forth.And that's why this issuch an important piece.Very different again.From how Indian systems work.Here, we have GD,where there's only fish market.I, this, that, I like to sing, I like to,hold on, repeat.I wanted to say the same thing.It's just crazy.And that is how GDs are,companies think that that tells them whocan raise their voiceand controls everyone,and can become resourceful.But I think that as such apoor representationof someone's capability.And interviews are largely technicalI remember,my worst interview of all times.It was for master's program at IIT kanpur,I got shortlisted,after the test and then there wasan interview. I was like,interview means interview.That they will ask like, yes, son,how are you?What do you do?You tell us about yourself.What do you want to do with life?What's the secret of your smile?So, I enter,And there sat, HC Verma.HC Verma is an HOD of physics departmentat IIT Kanpur.If you are a physics student,then you might haveheard the name HC. Verma,because all the books of physicswhich we study in 11th, 12thare written by HC. Verma.So, literally, the God of physicsis sitting there.And he gives me a problem.I remember that problem was relatedto some sine wave.I didn't understand anything.Like, sometimes it happens, right,that we understand a little,So, you can ask a clarification question.Think a little bit.But, sometimes you understand nothing.Zero.So where do you even start?And that was exactly what it was.So, I thought my personal interviewwould be taken.I put on some nice clothes,perfume and all.And there he handed me a chalk,pointed towards the board.He said, Ankur, please solve this problem.Then I stared at that empty blackboardfor a minute.I thought there's nothing I can do here.I said sorry.And I left the room.That was my experience.You don't want to be doing that,so, you want to be sure thatyou are prepared for that interviewAnd for that again,Leverage Edu helps you preparefor the interviews.Just as it helps youprepare for applications.So, all those things that you have to do.They teach you.They train you, prepare you.So, I would love for you to take theircounseling, take their servicesto make the most of what you have.While you sitting for the applicationas well as the interview process.So, this was the second episodeof The Complete Guide to Studying AbroadPowered by Leverage Edu.Third and final episode which willout next week.We will cover financial aid,how do you go about deciding thathow your finances or the aid that you got,that will come together?We will discuss visawe'll discuss accommodation and finallyleaving for the countryof your dreams.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.All right.
