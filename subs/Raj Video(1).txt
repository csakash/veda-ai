Today we have Raj Shamani with us!Welcome to the podcast, Raj!Thank you so much for having me!Dream come true!Ankur Warikoo has called meon his podcast!No, I was thinking about itand planning it for a long time,but I am so glad that it finally happened,and I have enjoyedour conversations lately,so I am looking forwardto this conversation as well.Yes, I am also excited for this.In fact, just wanted to quicklyput it out.I say this for very few places.I'm genuinely inspired by youand what you've done.You did it very quickly,the way you treated everything,I really like that!Thank you so much man, thanks a lot!There's a lot to learn from the community,so I am genuinely standingon the shoulders of a lot of people.There are so many brilliant creatorswho I passively observe,I don't engage actively.I keep sending my team these things,See what Raj has done,see what Ali has done,see what Sharan has done,see what this and that has done,because there is just so much to learnfrom everybody, so thank you,that means a lot, man!Ok, the first question for you is,If you look back, and you are still youngbut if you look back at the last 10 years,what is the biggest change in Raj?Wow!What a question at the beginning itself!I think the biggest change is thatnow I hold on to my people.Elaborate?Elaborate like going deeper in this.Earlier what I used to do is,I started working at 16,and I used to give speechesat different places, I was in UN,so I used to go to Vienna for UN,so I used to be in differentcountries and cities,and I always used to think that you becomelike the people you are surrounded with,so I used to befriend people,and then leave it,and then go one level up, and another.But now I feel that it is goodfor your professional life,but in your personal life,the 10-12 or 4-5 people you have,it's not nice to leave them,because more than comfort they are helpfulin your growth as well.So I think that is the biggest change.Now I have learned not to leave5 friends of mine.I'll tell you a great rule!I have a one-minute rule.I have to talk to whoever I lovefor 1 minute every day.Oh wow!It can be my mum, it can be my brother,it can be my friend, it can be anyone,with whom I may not have spokenfor 2 years,but one minute rule,every day before sleeping,either I will FaceTime my mum,or speak to a friend, or my dad,or my aunt, so I think that is one rule.This is the biggest change thatI've started cherishing people.Very cool!Are you close to your family?Very close!I am a mama's boy!Who are there in your family, Raj?Now I live alone in Bombay,but earlier I used to live in Indorewith 10 people.So mom-dad, my younger brother, 3 of us,and then myself, 4,then my big aunt and uncle,my elder sister and younger sister,and both my grandparents,so a total of 10 people.And now here in Bombay,I live with my dog.What is the dog's name?Crypto.I'm a crypto dad.Is the dog down right now?Oh my God!Does the dog have any ideawhat's happening in the worldwith his name?I really wish not.I don't want that the traitsin crypto right now should be in my dog.I know, I swear, that's crazy!Was this change because ofsome circumstance, some event,or a slow gradual realizationthat it is very important in life?I think it's a mix.I don't think a moment changes something,few things keep happeningwhich make you realize.If you see a video,let's say Ankur Warikoo is talking aboutrelationships, and then you are like,Oh, he makes sense!Sometimes you read a book,sometimes your parents say something,sometimes because you live aloneand you start feeling something,sometimes you are on a flightand you are just thinking,you can't sleep,you can't think about anything else,and you think that life is betterwith friends.So I think it's because ofa lot of realizations,sometimes after you watch a movie.So I think I started to think about itconstantly when I moved to Bombayduring the pandemic,and I was watching a documentary ofa rapper at that time,Dr. Dre.Usually among rappers what happens isthey make their friends as their managers,their videographers,and their friends start upgradingalong with them.So I thought it was really cool.How can I find out if my friends from10 years back are still my friends or not?It was a subtle pinch, so now I've reacheda position where all my friendsfrom 10 years back are again my friends,and we all are very close.Lovely!And is there anything that peopleoften tell you whether close to youare not so close to you that,Raj, you have changed a lot in this way?Yes.All my friends, everybody.They all say,You have changed, you are very busy now,and you don't have time.But I think it's a good thing.Do you like being busy?Not busy, but I think whenyour close people are telling youthat you have changed,then it's good because it meansyou are upgrading in life.It's good that they think thatyou are one level upthan you were earlier.I mean your friends should never feel thatyou are not with them in theirgood or bad times,if you're not letting that happenand people still say that you've changed,then it's good.So I feel that's ok, but otherwise,people keep talking.Ok, raj, something which you wereconstantly told or you felt in your 20s,and now you realize that it was a lie?The biggest thing,don't make mistakes!Mistakes are very bad!Yes!I genuinely feel that from school onlythey teach not to make mistakes,family says don't make mistakes,but I feel the simplest definitionin my mind for success is,number of risks taken minusnumber of risks taken which went negative,that is equal to success.Success.So the risk has to be takenfor both of them.So mistakes that give youpositive outcomes minus mistakes thatgive you negative outcomes,its net run rate,that decides how successfulyou will be in life.Interesting!Is Raj a risk taker from the beginningor just started?I think from the beginning itself.More than a risk takerI would say I keep changing things rapidlyand I don't think about it.If I really enjoy something,I will get so deep into it so quickly,and then I won't find any juice in it,so I will shift.So I don't think about the time,I spent 2-3 years on it,what will I do with my life,I just change it,because I feel like I've given it 3 years,but I cannot waste 30 years on it,that's the mentality with which I change,and I think it has been like thisfrom the beginning.It comes from parenting,I mean my family says this.My dad always used to tell mewhen I was a kid,No matter what you do,whether you become a sweeper,a dishwasher,or you want to create something,or you want to get into tech,do whatever you want,but do it better than anybody elsein your family and among your friends.So whenever I felt thatI am not doing it better,I used to shift.So I think that ability to shiftfrom one thing to another,if you call that risk-taking,I think I was like thatsince the beginning.Got it!What do you think is the riskiest thingyou have done in your life so far?I left my business with familywhen it was at its peak,and pursued content creation and speakingas a career full-time 2 years ago.Wow!And what got you to it?There were 2 reasons.Number 1, I felt that I was downplayingmy potential.I felt that as a creator,as a storyteller, and as a teacher,I can become much bigger and much betterthan I will be as an operator.So that was a realization.The second thing was that if you want togrow in life,two things are very importantif you want to do somethingat a big level.Access to capitaland access to distribution.Either you should have both or one of themif you want to do somethingat a major level.And I felt that by telling a storyon social media,access to distribution was getting solved,so I thought why not try it,because if this works outthen we will have somethingwhich people may not get even afterspending lakhs and crores of Rupees,that is distribution, access to people.There are so many startups,so many brands, so many businesseswho can give you 10-20 crores todayjust to have reach to millions of people,so I had this realization.I think that was the biggest risk thatI took in life, because otherwise,my life would be very sorted.I think when you have no option,then it's very easy to take a decisionin life.But when you have optionsand all of them are good,life is good, business is doing well,family is great, family and you are happy,you are getting authority, fame,image, everything,and then you say thatyou don't want to do thisand you change it into something elsewhere you are starting from zero,that decision is very difficult to take.Yeah, but I'm glad you did that!The world got Raj Shamanias a content creator.Yes, I am glad, in fact, I am 100% surethat even my parents are very happy.Have they expressed that?Do they express their happiness?Oh yes!Right before this call,I was talking to my dad on FaceTime,so I said,my sales in this quarter are not as good.And he said,Look at what you have gotten.If you earn even half of this,then I cannot be more proud than this,cannot be happier than this,what are you talking about!I was like, ok.I know.So he keeps sharing that every day.In fact, my family trackswhich of my Reels reached a million,how many followers did I touch,they keep telling me.That's awesome!Are you a data-driven guy?How do you operate in your head?Are you ideas, or creative, or data,like what is Raj Shamani's mental makeup?So I used to be that till I reacheda million followers.Earlier I used to be highly data-driven.Then after a million, I started a podcast,and I started that podcast out of love,out of curiosity.I think that among Ankur Warikoo,Mukesh Ambani, and Jeff Bezos,nobody is better than the other,all three are equal,it's just that three of them knowdifferent things because of whichthey have reached a level.So I think, I or anybody around meis not less than anybody else,we all are the same,so I thought of doing a podcastwith people who've achieved a lot in life,and learning from them as towhat is it that they knowbecause of which they are one level up,and that is what the idea was.So it started with passion, love,and curiosity, and after that,I did not look at the data,because I felt like,let's not put data in love.Just treat it like,What else can I learn from anybody else?What other kinds of questionscan there be?How much better can it be?So now it's no morea data-driven approach,but I think we are getting back to that,because what I have realized is thatI love growth more than anything,and growth happens only when you take datavery seriously.Initially, I grew rapidly,and now I am growing a lot ona satisfactory level,but the growth has reduced in numbers,and that's why I'll seewhat is being liked,and then start doing it.Got it!Of all the guests that you have had,and you had a lot ofinteresting conversations,was there ever a moment when somebody saidsomething which was in direct conflictwith your belief system,but you still loved it?Yeah, in fact, it happened recently.Shantanu Deshpande said it.I used to believe that to builda business in FMCG or anywhere else,you must have a USP,USP means Unique Show-off Preposition,because if you are not givinga reason to people,and in content,it becomes Unique Shareable Preposition,so if you're not giving a reason to peoplethat they can show-offor share with people,you cannot build a business,so you need that sexinessin your business.And Shantanu said thatthere are a lot of businesses thatare worth crores of Rupees,and they are unsexy businesses becausethey operate on insecurity,and I loved that!How great and how true thatthere are many such things thatpeople do not share with anyone,they do not even show off,but go and buy secretly and keep taking,and there is a huge market for it.He gave an example likehair growing products.People don't tell that they are using itbut it's a huge market.So there are many other things like this.So I loved that, and it wasa direct conflict with the beliefthat I had created in the last 10 yearsfor my business,and I still liked it.That's very nice!Yeah, he has a very different viewabout these things, especially becauseBombay Shaving Company is inthat kind of a business,so of course, he has to get thatthesis right as well.Usually what timedoes your day start, Raj?Very very direct attack question.We are gradually gettinginto time management.I get up at 10:30-11,my day starts pretty late.I sleep at 3-4.Wow!Because I feel my most consuming hoursare 12-3.I am able to do the best consumptionat that time.What all do you watch?What all?What all do you consume?I consume podcasts, books,movies on Netflix, everything.I am a big movie buff.I am a big series buff.I will watch everything, do everything,I read a lot of books,I hate reading, I hate it,but I think if people find me evenslightly interesting, it's becauseI've read a lot of books,so I force myself to read booksand that is the best time that I can read.I watch a lot of podcasts,I love watching podcasts.So yeah, I consume everything,anything at all, anything you say,and my interests are wild.Yeah!?Interests are wild!One day I am reading about how Amazonbuilt its operations,the next day I am watching a romcomby Korean cinema.I love this!What's the one thing you will bevery embarrassed to admit that you watch?I watched, I don't know,I watched 'Mean Girls'.But 'Mean Girls' is totally legit,it's quite legit.Yeah, I liked it!Sometimes I like to watch things likeHigh School Musical.I totally get that.You know things like Student of the Year,High School Musical, Mean Girls,I feel this is the life thatI never got in college,so I live my fantasy through that.I'll be embarrassed to admit that.What is the most undesirable partabout your day?Undesirable part about my day?I don't like shooting content.Oh, really, wow! That's fascinating!Tell us more.I don't like to face the camera.You can make me talkthe way we are talking now,I can give a lot of content like this,it's ok with me if I have to talkfor 10 hours,but if you tell me that look at the cameraand read a script,that's the most undesirable partof my day.And my team will tell you,my videographer hates me for it.Does that explain that inRaj Shamani's Reels,he is never looking at the camera?Yes.So there's actually somebody sittingwith whom you are talking?Yes, so what I do is,this is my process, ok!I'd love to know this.This is so awesome! Tell us!This is my process.I make 3 team members of minesit in front of me.Initially, there was just one,earlier I used to do it with my friends,my family, and as my team was built,now I do it with my 3 people.So I make 3 people sit in front of me,and I tell them,ask me the questions that peopleare asking me in the comments.You have one hour.You keep asking and I'll keep answering.And this whole session is recorded.So I talk the way I am talking right now,and it is recorded that way,then my content strategist looks at it,and then my content is edited.Raj spoke 10 things well,and 10 reels are made.That is so smart!This is such an incredible idea!This is a very deep insight, man.What you have done is,you have converted your strengthinto something that you are supposed to dobut don't like doing.Yeah.And if any person learnsto do this in life,then it becomes their superpower.You have essentially zeroed downon one thing that you are so good at,and still are doing what the world wantsyou to do.This secret is open now!How often did you use to get this commentthat look at the camera, my friend?A lot!Bro, what's there in the camera?People ask me,who are you looking at and talking?Who is it?We want to know.Why are you acting?In fact, people started saying,do you have the script on the sideand reading from it?Is that the reason why you're not looking?But there is always a person sittingand we are talking, and we are having fun.This is awesome!Do you have this as a set thing thatwe will work at this hour on this day,or do you start working wheneveryou feel like it?No, we decide that we will do thisat this time tomorrow,but then it happensat any time during the week.There is no day as such,because I think the biggest task withknowledge creators isknowledge consumption,to think about consumption.Like when you read somethingand you like it,then you are super excited to work on it,so I am not a writer,I don't keep it in writing,a lot of people write downthe ideas they get,but when I get it,I have created a group on WhatsApp,and the name of the group isTweets Only.I just write a line there and say thatit is a tweet-worthy line,then it is tweeted,then my team extracts itand asks me questions based on thaton the next day,and then they extract from itand create Reels.Nice!That makes a lot of sense!Wonderful!Who manages your money, Raj?Who manages my money?I have done it in 3 phases.One was really bad,the second one was less bad,and now the last one has been really good,so I'll tell you the 3 phases.My bank people give me ULIP or whatever,and I started it with them,and I realized that I am payingso many commissions,so I didn't want to do that.In fact, for the longest time,for 3 years, I had investedin the lowest-performing mutual fundof my bank.Somebody has earned a lot of incentivesthrough Raj.Yes.So that was the first one.So that was from 18 to 21.Then from 21 to 24-25, I managed it myselffor 4 years.I created my portfolio myself.I invested in 10-12 different places.In fact, I used to think thatif you invest in 7 different places,then you get a lot of income.That was a good approach to learningbecause that made me understandhow alternative assets work,how mutual fund work,how small cap and large cap work,and how real estate works,so that was a good learning phase.I earned good returns too,but then I realized,last to last year,when I went into it deeper thatthere is no need to complicate it so much.So I invest at 2-3 different places,one stable, one slightly risky,and one extremely risky.If you can divide your allocationin them according to your risk appetite,then also life can be good.So that's what I do now.Now I do the majority through PMS,and then a small amount throughcertain stocks that I pick myself,and I do it that way.Got it!Have you invested in cryptobesides your dog?Yeah, a lot!I have invested in cryptos,I have invested in NFTs,I've invested in wine market,I have invested in sneakers.Wow!So it's diverse.I want to know everything.I want to do a little bit of everything,but I have a limit,so I have 10% of my moneywhich is experiment money.I do everything with this 10%.I'll put 2% in crypto, 5% in sneakers,and things like that.Nice! Interesting!What's the most expensive thing you own?Most expensive thing that I own?I don't know, man.I don't really have anything expensive.Something must be the most expensive,even if it is reasonable!Yes, I am thinking.Camera, mic?I'm thinking.I have a car, but that's a family carlike 4 people bought it together,so my mum, dad, brother, and me,all four of us bought it together,so I don't know if you consider that,but besides that, I think...What do you spend money on?Travel.That's a good one.Ok, tell us about that.Do you like traveling with friends,solo, where?I love everything!I love traveling alone, I love...The most expensive thing I do every yearis go to Music Festivals inbusiness classesand just spend money there.Love that!Which was the recent one that you did?EDC in Las Vegas.Lovely!Electric Daisy Carnival,this is the most expensive thingthat I do.Besides that, I am an extremelyROI-driven person.I will invest only if I geta return on investment otherwise not,so I see the investment in maximum things,I don't know about the expenditure.I have spent a lot on music festivals,and a reason why I like it is I seta goal for myself,and if I hit that goal then I willtravel business class,and if I don't hit that goalthen I'll travel normally.What is that goal right now?There is a target every month,and this month,I have not covered that target,so I am not traveling anywhere this month.And is it usually a sales target?It depends on different things.Like it was for the book,to make it a best seller then I would.If it is a sales targetor a number target,sometimes it is a business target as well,like starting this divisionand running something,so a different target every time,whatever we like.Very interesting!I love that thing!What is the best thing about travelingin business?The best thing is that you don't haveto stand in line.That is like I will just walk inwherever I want to becauseI have that kind of access.And I think that's the only thing whyI like business, otherwise,anything would be fine.Is it?Yeah, what is comfort all about,it doesn't matter, you have to sitwhile traveling mostly.On international flights,you can lie down,but still, I can sleep anywhereso it doesn't matter.I can even sleep while standingor sitting, and I sleep on flightsbecause I have motion sickness.As people say that they spendtheir traveling time on reading,watching, thinking,I can't do any of these becauseif I am awake I would be throwing up,that's why I sleep.So it doesn't matter to me how comfortablethe flight is, I just have to sleepand I can sleep anywhere,so the best part is since I am so sleepyand if you make me stand in a linefor an hour at that point in time,I don't like that.That's why I like business class,that's the only reason,and I've attached even that with a goal,if I achieve it then only I will get it,otherwise, I'll stand.Yes exactly, sleep while standing.Do you like business classor economy class, what do you like?For anything greater than 5 hours,definitely business.Definitely, so I have a rule for this.If I am traveling with friends,then any class is fine,but if I am traveling solo,then I go by business class becausethen I can sleep up as it's comfortable.Yeah, we do the same, but as a family,we try and avoid business classbecause we don't want our childrento get used to business,but if it's just Ruchi and me or just me,then yes, business.In domestic,I don't see the purpose of it.It makes no sense in domestic.Yes, exactly.It's an absolute waste of money.They just serve food to you on a plate.One thing, and feel free not to answerif you are not comfortable,how much will Raj Shamani's totalcontent creation business earnin the year 2022?I can't tell you PBT or PAT.That's perfectly fine,give us the top line.Topline in 2022, how much we will doas a run rate?We'll do around 1.4 million or 5 million.Ok, interesting.And a million is counted at â¹80?Yes, â¹80.Ok.So around 10 to 12?Yes, we will do 10 to 12.10-12 Cr.And how much was this last year?Last year was fivish, something like that,so we have doubled up the top line.Are you happy with the growth?Kinda!What would you have liked it to be?I wanted it 3x this year,and we actually achieved that,but our two major brand dealsbecause of certain circumstancesin the country fell off,so we couldn't do that.Got it!Ok, understand.Outside of India,if Raj Shamani had to settle anywhere,where would you want to settle?Very tough question becauseI am an extremely patriotic personplus I love India, excessively love it!I mean from love point of view,people point of view,and growth point of you,I think India is the best for all three,I don't want to go anywhere.But in case if I ever have to move,I think it will be London or New Yorkbecause I love chaotic places,I love chaotic city vibes, I like that,I don't like peaceful places.#Mumbai!Exactly!And also because there are a lot ofIndian students in London and New York,so it gives the Indian vibe,so I think that's the reason.I know.Beaches or mountains?Beaches but when it's cold.Like not beacheswhen it's really really hot.Sunny and sweaty!Yes, I don't like that!I like beaches when I am feeling cold.Got it!Which startup would you love to bethe CEO of?Wow! Amazon!But now it's not a startup anymore.But there is a reason for Amazon.I feel Amazon is a disruption businessso I really like it.Let me think about an Indian startupthat is actually a startup right now.Let me think because there are so manyin my mind, and I want to becomethe CEO of 3-4.Tell us.I think Cred, I would really wantto be the startup founder of Credbecause I know very little aboutthis business,and I speak to 10 people who are experts,and all of them tell me different things.So I want to know the mystery behind it.I want to understand how is sucha big brand created,how is its distribution createdregardless of certain things,so I want to know that.The other obvious answerwould have been Zerodha,but everybody has said thatbecause everybody loves profit after tax,it's a bootstrap business.It's amazing what Zerodha is doing,but its story is absolutely unlocked.I like a business with a mysterywhich is like a disruption business tryingto do something, so Cred.Yeah, ok, good answer, awesome!Any go-to song of Rajwhen you are down and aboutor when you are happy,do you listen to a song on loop?Many!I'll tell you one in Hindi and English.In English, there is a song calledCounting Stars.Ok.Do you like it?Have you heard of it?No.I may have without knowing the name,right now I don't remember.So there is a line in Counting Stars...Lately I've been I've been losing sleep,Dreaming about the thingsthat we could be.Yes.Thinking about the things we could be.So it's like,Today we are counting dollars,Tomorrow we will be counting stars.So it's like, no more counting dollars,we'll be counting stars.So it sounds really good when I am low.So that's something that I really like.The other song calledAm I Wrong?I really like that!The lyrics of Am I Wrong are,Am I wrong for thinking thatwe could be something for real?So that's like out-of-the-box thinking.And there is a song in Hindi,it's again like low mellow.Zinda by Lootera.I love that song.That's a really good one!There is a line in it,Zindagi se aur kuch mangna nahin haiJitna mila kafi hai.So I love that because that makes mesuper grateful.And it has a great linewhich I really love,it's slightly deep,Kabr par meri sar utha karkhadi ho zindagi,Bas aise marna hai mujhe.Like I want to be joyousand stand like this when I am dying,that's the only wish I have.Goosebumpy!Brilliant man! Love it!Awesome!This was a great conversation.3 final questions, rapid-fire,whatever comes to your mind first.My hamper is coming!My hamper is coming, it won't have coffee.Money or power?Power.Why?Power, because power can help youdo things which money cannot,and you can make a positive impactor a negative impact with power.Yeah.Speed or perfection?Speed, I don't thinkI am at the age of perfection.Right now I have to have a lot of speedand make many mistakes.Right now speed, maybe 10 years laterI will choose something else.Perfect, awesome!What do you think will bethe most expensive thingyou will buy excluding real estate?Private jet.You are the third person I have spoken towho's after a private jet.Tanmay Bhat wants a private jet,Shlok Tech Burner wants a private jet,you want a private jet.I think India will be the biggest consumerof private jets by the next decade.Why did people say that?Did you ask them the reason?Tanmay was like,Delhi-Bangalore business class is â¹45,000,if I buy a private jet,it's â¹1,00,000 per seat,if I vlog it, I will earn â¹50,000,so I am sorted.That was simple.Shlok was like,It's very convenient, so when the businesshas the money,they will buy a jet worth 600 crores.What is your bigger reason?My reason is that I love doing thingsat my convenience, and I want my parentsto get spoilt to another level.I want that I can send the private jetwhenever I like and call my parents,and then we all can travel.So it's very emotional, like family reasonbecause my family, that's the only reason,I don't have a logical reason.It's a simple reason.I want my parents to have the conveniencebecause they do not travel at all.Because every time they are like,let's travel right now,and then we plan to go after a monthbut then they never go,so it can happen only in that moment,and that's why I want the jetso that we plan and we fly there and then.So that's the only reasonI want a private jet.And you don't want to stand in a line.Not at all!Awesome!This was so good Raj!Thank you so much! It was great fun!Thank you for that honestcandid conversation!I got to know a lot about youwhich I didn't know, I am surethe audience will also love it.Thank you for doing what you do,it really makes a difference!Thank you so much for having me!Thank you for asking me questions.I hadn't thought of a lot of thingsabout myself, so thank you for asking meall of these questions.Awesome man!All the best!Thank you!Super!
