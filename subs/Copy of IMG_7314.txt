This was in 2007,and my mutual fundsâ investmentswere about â¹3,50,000.And then at that time,there came a huge crash.Stock market went down 50% in 2007-2008.My â¹3,50,000 became â¹2,00,000.And in a panic, I sold all of them.I left them in my bank to rotand if I hadnât sold that stock,that mutual fund, then today,they would be â¹18,50,000.A lot of you are going to experiencethe same thing right now.A lot of people started investingin the past 1-2 years,and they have no idea what happenswhen the market crashes.My suggestion:stay patient, stay invested.
