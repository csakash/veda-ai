Piyush will go straight to the video,no intro, no outro,sorry, there will be outro.No intro and straight get started.A little fast paced.If you only read 10 books in lifethen according to methese should be the 10 books.Number 1:Linchpin by Seth Godin.A very beautiful bookwhich I probably read in 2008 or 2009,it's been a long time.In this book, Seth Godin tellshow you can become indispensable in life.It means how you can through your work,through your perspectivecan create such an existence,from where people can never dislodge you.They understand you so minutelyand assess you so well, respect you,that you'll always remainimportant to them.Especially in your 20s,this book will be the best book for you.If I'm talking about these books,then I also want to sharefive such biographies and autobiographies,which I liked very muchand you can choose them too,so will do 15 booksBut 10 which are very important.Number 2:Sapiens, this is a book by Yuval Harari.Is a very, very, very good book.Which is basically,as it says a brief history of humankind.So, how did we get started?How did we become the mostdominant species among all living beings?What are those characteristicsthat make mankind, humankind so dominant?And how money was established,religion was founded?What were the important eventsthat happened in our civilizationand how because of all that,we have reached today?This is a bookwhich will just make you very awareabout the real world.Often, we take many things for granted.Take money for granted.Lord, God,whoever it is that you believe in,take them for granted.But this book slowly tries to tellthat how all those things emergedand how they have impacted our life.let's talk aboutautobiographies or biographies.One biographywhich I would highly recommend,Beyond the Last Blue Mountain,This is JRD Tata's autobiography,sorry biography,which is written by R.M. Lala.It is an incredible story about JRD Tata.How he established Tatafrom its inception till now,How did his values materialize.How influenced by hispersonal journey and life,he tried to make the company the same way.I cannot over-emphasizethe power of this book.Itâs a very, very nice book.Number 3on the 10 books you must read in life,Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,This is my original copy,due to which,you see it in this yellow condition.I, let me just check,when is this book from?It is incrediblethat I have all of these books.This book is, 2003,2003 book,means my print is 2003.And this is by a guy named Robin Sharma.Robin Sharma is a very famous motivator,speaker, philosopher.And this story is,is basically a fiction bookabout a lawyer,who is completely drained out in lifeand then that guy goes on to realizewhat is the true meaning of life.So, itâs said,a very powerful quote of Confucius,We all have two livesand the second one begins when we realizewe only have one.This book is the best testimonyto that quote.Brilliant book,as soon as you can read this bookin your life,the more you will benefit yourself.Around this book, number 4:Manâs Search for Meaning.This is Viktor's book, Viktor Frankl,This is a true story.This is a true story about Viktor,Who was a prisoner in Nazi Germany,as a Jew.And despite all the hardships,in the midst of all the circumstances,one of his views, which held him in hope,which held him in good light,is what this book is about.Because of this bookthere is a new formof therapy that was introduced,I will not tell about it.because once you read the book,and is a very thin book,So, it is not a very big book.It is something that will impactyour life foreverif you truly read it at the right time.In biographies and autobiographies,Elon Musk, this is by, Ashlee Vance.Very seminal book around Elon.At such depth, about Elon Musk,it has hardly been written in any bookor covered in an article.His life is still going on.Like literally,last week, Elon Musk, bought Twitterand don't know whatis he going to do with Twitter.So, his life is so vibrantthat at any point, writing his biographyis almost like capturinga small part of his entire life.So maybe only after him a propercomplete book will be able to come out.But until then, it's a great book to learnhow does this man's mind work?What was his upbringing like.What shaped him upand why he is where he is today.Number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Yes.Number 5,on the list of 10 booksyou must read in your life,is Atmamun.Atmamun is written by Kapil Gupta.Kapil Gupta is not a very famous author.He has a huge presence on Twitter.But he actively speaks about the truthand this bookwill probably be the most powerful bookof my life.A very close is number 6,about which I am going to talk now.But between number 5 and number 6,I think these two bookshave brought the most positive influencein my life.When I read this bookand it was recently,maybe a year or two ago.It just changed everythingthat I knew about my life.Because it validated a lot of my beliefsthe way I had lived my lifeand have continued to live.And made it all very clear in wordsSo, Kapil Gupta, is a master guy.This is such a book that probablyif you read it in your 20s,you won't understand it,would fail to process it.Is a very hard book, very difficult book.But if you read it at the right time,it will come to you in a way thatâ¦Number 3in biographies and autobiographies,Will Smithâs biography, Will,and itâs written by Mark Manson,The same person who wroteThe Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck.So basically,Mark Manson is a ghost writer.Will Smith's own life,in his own words, in some wayand what I love about Will,off course,living aside the recent controversy,anything this man focused on,he got that thing,Like he wanted to become a hip hopper,became one.Wanted to become a TV artist,became one.Wanted to become the biggest movie staron the planet, became one.And itâs just incredible,like how through hard workthrough just his mindset,this guy has been able to achieve so much.Itâs a very nice book.It goes into the details of Willâs life,where he grew up, how that shaped him up,and how he is who he is.Which is what I find most fascinatingwhenever I readany biography or autobiography,that where and when was the seedof the personâs nature sown.Number 6, on books that you have to read,Courage to be Disliked.So between Atmamunand Courage to be Disliked,my life is complete.If I ever feel lost,if I ever feel,the need to be reminded abouthow to live life,I pick up one book out of these two books,open any page,and start reading.And that is what I loveabout Courage to be Disliked.This is a conversationbetween a teacher and a philosopherspanning over five nightsand it is genuinely everythingthat you need to know about life.As the book says,Courage to be Disliked,Getting to a pointwhere you have the couragethat no matter what anyone thinks of you,you don't care.and the book actually goes on to saythat a single book can change your life,which I believe is truewhen it comes to this book.Number 7,in the books that one should read.Rework by Jason Fried,Even this is my original copy.When is this from? Letâs see.This is 2000, 2010,from 2010,when I read this book, 2009,yes, I had read this book in 2010and it changed everythingthat I knew about work.This is one such book, which will tell youthat how our attitude towards workshould be differentand how the worldkeeps telling us something about work,which is not always correct.and if you want to,then think about redefining life,then this is a great book to start.In biographies and autobiographiesnext is Phil Knight, Shoe Dog.Phil Knight, is the creator of Nike.So, Swooshand Shoe Dog is his autobiographyOne of the best autobiographieswhich I have read.Nike is one such brand,which I like very much.Not just for its marketingbut also, its values.Also, the way the companyhas been built up.And Phil Knight's storyis immensely inspiring.A story that tells uskeep going, just keep going.It is incrediblethat during Nike's beginningand this is not just a few yearsbut like literally, years and years,it was almost like, it could die anytime.It could die anytime.And yet Phil Knight persistedand look at where Nike is.Number 8, on books we want to read.Philosophy,Psychology of Money. Philosophy...Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel.I like this book becauseand I often talk about this book,Because it does not focus so muchon how money is made or invested,but on what is the nature of moneyand how does it match your nature,it discusses about that.Thatâs why, Psychology of Money,not how to make money,how to grow money and so on and so forth.Incredible book, very deeply researched.If you don't know Morgan Housel,so, you can read his blogswhich he has been writingfor the last several yearson his blogand this book is franklya compilation of his best blogs,and of course,some new work that has come in.Iâve often talked about this bookand if you want to read only one bookon money, this should be it.Number 9 on 10 booksone should read in their lifetime,The Almanack of Naval Ravikant,Naval Ravikant is an entrepreneur,is a thinker.Very active on Twitter. In fact,is probably active only on Twitter,No, is also active on Instagram, etc.And this book by Chris,no sorry, by Eric,this book by Eric,is basically a compilationof Naval's tweets.So whatever Naval has tweetedfor those many years,Eric has written this bookby gathering them all.It is an incredible book about just life.it is not aboutnecessarily entrepreneurshipnot about start-ups,But Naval is a technology entrepreneur.Has lived in Silicon Valley,so its flavor is there.But this book is essentiallyabout how to live lifewhat should be your attitude towards life.I was saying should I first showthe autobiography first or this.Finally, the 10th bookthat every person should read,Atomic Habits by James Clear.This is an incredible book.A book that tells you,how through small habitsyou can bring big changes.And this book does it in a waythat no other book has come ever close to.Has been a bestseller, don't know,millions of copies have been sold.And with no surprise,The 5th biographyin biography and autobiography,that I want to share,is Paramahansa Yoganandaâs autobiography,The Autobiography of a Yogi.It is, I think,the toughest book that I have read.Itâs a thick bookand it is also very, very deep.So, like there is Courage to be Dislikedor Atmamun,Which probably strikes usonly at one point of life,not always.This book is like that.but if you can draw the courageto read this bookthen I would highly recommended itbecause it has so much clarityabout life in general,and off course through the lifeof Yogananda Ji,that you will be left absolutely clear,and certain about how things are,Here are the 10 bookswhich I think every person should readat least once in their life.I want to give all these 10 booksto you as a gift,And the way to do that is,just go and type in the comment sectionwhich of these 10 books you like the most.Whichever person I choose,I will give them all the 10 books.But I want to seewhich is the one book that you choose.There is no right answer,there is no wrong answer.I am not going after any one book.I just want to focuson what basis do you choosethat one book out of the 10 booksthat I have selected for you.That is how the contest will be.This contest will be open for two weeks.Two weeks after this video--Two weeks after the release of this videoI will pick one random winnerand that person will get all the 10 booksthat I have shared in this video.I hope this was funand the link for all these booksis in the description and pinned comments.If you go to those linksand buy these books by clicking on themthen I earn an affiliate incomefrom Amazon,100% of that incomegoes towards the education of kidswho can't afford it.Last year we distributed â¹36 lakhsto 53 students.This year we have alreadydistributed 30-35 lakhs.I haven't counted it yet.So, I am very certain that this yearweâll distribute it amongmore than 50 lakhs students.All of those are in a positionthat they cannot afford their educationand they need our helpand you are all helping me help themThank you so much for that.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
