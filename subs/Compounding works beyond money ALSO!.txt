This story is from my 7th class,Don't know what my teacher was thinkingand got me registered in the inter-classpoem recitation competition.I was afraid of getting up on the stage.Extreme fear.I still remember, my name being calledand I went on stage.My heart was racing,my hands were sweating,legs were shakingand I only wanted one thing,I finish this poem as soon as possibleand end of misery.So I started narrating the poem.And as soon as it was over, silence.Everyone is staring at me.Watching meBut not a single personis doing anything else.Applause is a very distant thing.No one is even booing.No one is even shouting.No one even said, hey get lost.Silence, but I didn't care.I was just happy that this incident,this experience is over.I got off the stage.Went back to my friend and sat down.My friend saw me.Said Ankur,what just happened?I said, what happened friend?What just happened?He said that you went on stage.You started speaking.Your mouth was moving.But no sound was coming from it. Silence.For 2 minutes, on the stage,I kept moving my lips,kept talking to myself,but not a word came out of my mouth.That was my first stage experience.At that time, I decidedfor the rest of my life,I would never go on stage.Then in the 11th class,an incident happened again.In class 11th,you give farewell to class 12th students,and when the give farewell is given,there used to be a big event,especially in our schoolit used to usually happen.And that event is hosted by the MCor the main comperes.There were two boys,one boy fell ill at the last moment.And my 11th class teacherused to trust me a lot.More than I trusted myself.So she pushed me and said,Ankur you go.I still remember my 7th class experience.And I had resolved at that time,literally, the vow of Bhishma Pitamahthat I will never go on stage in my life.But that teacher showed so much emotion,told me with so much confidence,that I went and I actually enjoyed myself.I wasn't awesome, I wasn't a rock star,but I enjoyed going on stage.And I felt I could do more of it.And that's what startedmy public speaking experience.Today when you listen to me,on Instagram, on YouTube,or have heard me on stage,and you like how I communicate,it is important to knowthat this is a practice of 20-25 years.I was not like this since birth.In fact, my first experienceas I did share, with all of you guys,was a very horrible experience.And I am here in front of you,as a result of compounding.Compounding friends,does not happen only with money,compounding often when spoken,is said only in the experience of money,that hey invest money,through compounding,will become a big number,but I am here to tell youthrough this video,in real life compounding happensin many things even without money.The first experience, I shared with youis public speaking.Today I go to colleges, I go to companies,in the last 2-3 years,I have given corporate talksin more than 200 companies,and all of that has happenedbecause every time I go on the stage,slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly,I ensure that I am betterthan who I was the last time.I am better than who I was the last timeI am better than who I was the last time.And that is compounding.Number two: Reading.In childhood, there was not enough moneyto read books.So there were only two chancesto read the book.One was the school library,but there were mostly boring booksor school books. So naturally,there are no comics,there are no story books.Or whenever we went on vacationand traveled by train,so papa used to say at the book stall,that you can buy a comic today.My reading journey started by readingChacha Chaudhary, Billoo, Pinky, Nagraj,Super Commando Dhruv.Then as I grew up a bit,made friends, realized with friends,they have some English comics too.Be it Archie's,be it Asterix, be it Tintin,started reading that.But the big thing that happenedwas that the family on my mother's sideis highly educated,many of them had gone to UKfor their studies.So they are very well read.They are very intelligent.They are very well educated.And they have a very distant niecewho used to read Enid Blyton's books.You might not know about Enid Blyton,but is a very, very, very famous writer,from UK.And she writes children's books.And one day my mom took meto Hauz Khas Enclavewhere they used to live.Their big thousand-yard mansionand there Virni Didi who was the niecethat I was talking about,she gifted me 14 books of Enid Blyton.And that was my first experienceof reading a non-comic book.I kept reading, the habit kept forming.Kept reading, the habit kept forming.Kept reading, the habit kept forming.And today, I read every day.I finish a book in almost a weekAnd I have learned so much from readingthat I can't even tell youbecause there are two waysto learn in life.One by learning through your own mistakes.Which can prove costly.And can also take a long time.Or second, by reading books.Think about it this way.A book costs â¹300-400.That means a full large pizza.And with that moneyyou can learn somethingfrom someone's whole life.Someone has had all the experiencesof his whole life,all the failures, all the successes,what he has learned, all thathas been written for youin one book for â¹300-400.And that is a power of a book.It compounds like crazy.Because we learn so much fromthe experiences of others,which you will probably never be ableto experience as much in your own life.Start reading today itself.Number three: Content creation.And this is my finest example.Because it can genuinelyteaches power of compounding.Make a guess.I started this YouTube channelin August 2017Until August 2020,I put out a video every week.How many followers do you think I made?Answer is About 20,000.20,000 followers,after 3 years of hard work.Every week little, little, little,slowly, slowly, slowly,growing, growing, growing,But the curvewas going in an upward direction.And then within 1 year, it went up.Last week on this channel,we added 26,000 followers.Means, in the first 3 years,I added 20,000 followersand 26,000 followersin a week of March 2023.This is the power of compounding.Let's talk about Instagram.I started Instagram in 2017.Until March 2020, for 3 years,I had some 14,000 followers.For 3 years I am wholeheartedlyuploading content,whatever I wanted to shareI am doing all that.Last week we added 16,000 followers.Means 15,000 followers in first 3 yearsand close to 20,000in a random week of March.This again is the power of compounding.You stayed on and slowly,slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowlythe curve starts going up.This is true for content creation.It's true for skilling.It's true for any course that you have.It's true for your experience.It is true for every single thing in life.Piyush, when I say all these numbers etc.,then put them nicely in a chart.Ask Shaurya for the dataso that you can plot these over a graph.So that will be great.Number four: Meditation.Meditation is somethingthat many people want to do.But it is difficult to do.It is difficult to control your emotionsby closing your eyes.Think what you should think,don't think what you shouldn't think,but this is a wrong definitionof meditation.Many people think that meditation is,controlling your emotions.Through mediation,you can decide what will you feel?No friend, you can never decidewhat you will feel.You can only decidewhether you will feel that feelingor observe it.What do I mean by that?Meditation gives you an abilitythat you can observe your feelings.You say that I am getting angry.Not that I'm angry.I can see that I am getting angry.I can see that my heart is beating fast.I can see that I am feeling frustrated.I can see my face is turning red.I can see my ears are turning red.And this is an observation.But meditation allows you to observeand let go.Observe and let go.It'll be very difficult in the beginning,it will be extremely difficultin the beginning,you will not be able to see your mind evenfor 5 minutes or 5 seconds?So much chatter goes onthat you will go mad and say,forget it, it's not happening.But have to keep going.Have to keep going.I started meditating almost 7 years back.For the past 1,350 days,I've meditated every single dayFor 1,350 days, every dayI have meditated for half an hour.And that is something that I'm proud of.I don't think I will break the habitof meditation ever in my life.Because it gives me so much peace.That's the only timewhen through my own mindI can see myself, hear myself,and still do not react.And this is a beautiful experiencethat I would love every single one of youto experience for once.Next, getting up early.Many peoplewant to wake up early in the morning.But where do they go wrong?Today we get up at 8:00,tomorrow we want to get up at 6:00,so set the alarm for 6:00 and get up.You know what?You will also get up.You will get up on the first day,you will get up on the second day,you will get up on the third day also,but on the fourth day,your body will yell and say,sleep for five more minutes.Sleep for 10 more minutes.Come on let's sleep.Used to get up at 8:00.Were living then as well, at that time,Didn't die.What did you do after getting up at 6:00?And you will start giving yourselfthese excuses.But here is where the power of compoundingcomes in.If today you wake up at 8:00and tomorrow want to wake up at 6:00then that is impossible.It is not possible.What is possible is,that you ultimatelywill be able to get up at 6:00and here is how to do it.You will set the alarm for tomorrownot for 6:00, but for 7:50.10 minutes before your wake-up time.And you will do that for 3 weeks.For 3 weeksyou will get up regularly at 7:50.Because it is only a 10-minute difference,the body will not feel it,but what you would have done,is you would've gotten habituated to 7:50.Then the next alarm at 7:40,10 minutes less.By 3 weeks, the body got used to it again.Will keep doing it until it gets used to.Then next alarm 7:30.Body used to.Then 7:20, body used to.Then 7:10, body used to.Then 7:00, body used to.And you will continue doing ittill you get to 6:00 a.m.It will take timebut by the time you reach there,you will be so used to it,that one day if you wake up at 7:00 again,the next dayyou will wake up again at 6:00because the bodymust have got used to it.I wake up anywherebetween 4:30 and 5:00 every day.And without alarm my body instantlywakes up at 4:30 and 5:00.And this happens clinically.Because I used to wake up at 9:00 at 8:00,just like you once upon a time.It took me 3.5 years,3.5 years to wake up at 5:00.But I did it.And those 3.5 years slowly, slowly,slowly, slowly  I kept reaching till 5:00.And now that it's happened,I have been waking upbetween 4:30 and 5:00for almost 2-2.5 years now,and it is clock work.Habit forever.Power of compoundingNext and perhapsthe most important exampleof compounding, relationships.Relationships compound, friend.Relationships that start to stagnate,they slowly start to rot,start getting rusty,and that becomesa toxic relationship for you.I met my wife at the age of 19.We started dating when I was 20.We got married at the age of 27.Today we both are 42.Means we are with each other for 23 years.We have lived togetherfor more than half of our life.More than half of what we have livedwith our parents.And because of this,we have grown up together.We are each other's best friends.We know each other so wellbecause we kept growing slowly every year.Kept knowing new thingsabout each other and ourselves.Today Ruchi and I work with each other.She is my manager.She handles the entire business sideof the entire businessand I do the all the content creation.I didn't know that working with each othercould be so interesting and so enjoyable.But it is.We sit every day, discuss brand deals.Should go here.Should that be done or not.This should be rejected.He should be accepted.We make all of those decisionsand it is so joyfulto actually be working with your spouse.But more importantly, your best friend.This same thingwith any other relationship,be it with parents, be it with siblings,be it with friends, be it with colleagues,be it with yourself,you have to ask yourself this every yearis this relationship the same as last yearor has it progressed beyond that or not?And if it is progressing,then you let it be.Because it is then compounding.By adding a new growth rate on a new base,it's getting much betterand you are learning so muchbeing part of that relationship.The power of compounding.And last, working out.Respecting your body.I didn't respect my body for 32 years.I frankly abused my body.Ate whatever I wanted.I am from Delhi so chole bhature,aloo tikki, burger, chaat papdi,dosa, all this.And I kept telling myself,will fix it tomorrow.Will fix it tomorrow.Will go to gym tomorrow.Will exercise from tomorrow.Will stop eating all this from tomorrow.But that tomorrow never arrived.So my body gave me that tomorrow.I went through a surgery.At the age of 32, I had a hip surgery.Bedrest for 3 months.Crutches by 5 months.And then after that was convinced,how important is the body?That's when I started respecting the body.Paying attention to it.I made a full videoon how I went from an obese90-kg person at the age of 32to a 69-kg, 6-pack abs person,at the age of 33.These 6-pack abs were not for anyone.Had already tied the knot.Didn't want to impress anyone.But I did it because I wantedto impress myself.I wanted to be in the best physical formthat I have ever beenand I have been so all through.I am still as fit as I want to be.In fact, I am working on a new regimen.Have changed my diet.Have changed my exercise routine.Working with a professional trainer.And the idea is to keep gettingbetter and better and betterand respect your body in a mannerwhich is probably your biggest giftand equally your mind.Mental fitness is just as important,as physical fitness.No matter how physicallyattractive you are,if your mind is not attractivewhat will you do? Will you pickle it?So it is important thatyou have positive thoughts.You surround yourselfby positive content.You take care of yourself,if you are in any form of negativity.You do therapy.You take professional help.You make sure that are surroundedby people, who encourage you.Who validate you. Who help you.Who support you.Because of that you begin to realizethat there is a lot more to youthen what you thought that was.All these examplesare examples of a beautiful concept,called compounding.One such thingwhich is applicable not only on money,but in every aspect of life.And I would love for you to experiencethe joy of it by starting early.The most fundamental wayof implementation of compoundingis how much time you give it.It's not importanthow much you start with,it's important, to what extent you do it.And that means start today.Start now.Start for yourself.And experience the magic of compounding.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
