If I were to start thisYouTube channel today,then I would adopta 1-3-10-100 approach.1 month,3 videos,10 videos,100 videos.Letâs understand what I mean.First of all, I woulddedicate one monthonly and only for research.The truth is that YouTube is a science. The videos on YouTube are focused on a sciencewhere consumer behaviorand psychology are themost important things. Why do you click on a video? Because its thumbnail is trying to tell you something,its title is very interesting.Why do you click a videoand start watching it?Why do you click a videoand 5 seconds later, move on to the next video?Everything dependson human behavior.So, what I would do is the first month, the entire month,every day,I would watch topperforming videos and try to know thatwhat is it about those videosthat is engaging me?What was so special in its thumbnail,in its title, in its editing,in its music, in its scripting, in its actingwhich got me hooked?And that research of one month will form the foundation ofwhat my videos would focus on.You might have heard of Mr. Beast.He is considered the most fabulous, the biggest celebrity on YouTube, and if you followed his journey, 24 hours a day, with his friend,they just analyzed videos.And that has gotten to point where his videos,on the first day itself, generate 20-30 million viewsbecause they understandhuman behavior.They can create content on anything and it will workThey can create content on anything and it will work becausethey are not creating content,they are getting in our minds and talking to our conscience,and that is what I would do.After that,3 videos.The first 3 videos. I would be lying if I said,âYour first 3 videosare very important.â They are not.Your first 3 videos, in your mind,are important for youbut no one cares about the factthat you posted 3 videosfor the first time.So, why these 3videos are important? They are important because these are your first 3 steps,and taking thesesteps is important. Often, people stop at this point.They are always in searchof the perfect video, the perfect hair,the perfect script, the perfect editing, the perfect storyline, the perfect thumbnail, the perfect title,they stop and never move forward.Your first 3 videosmust be posted,whatever they stand for.Even if one person watches them, or 5 people from your family,doesn't matter. You have to get them out.Then, next 10 videos.The next 10 videoswill be for your training.These videos will be about, during the first 3 videos,whatever shortcomingsyou found out,whether it was your delivery, or your editing,or your thumbnail,or your title, or any other component which you want to focus on.And you know thatif you focus on it,it will change the game for you.Those 10 videoswill be your experimentation lab. In these 10 videos,you would be all over the place.You would be testingsomething here,testing something somewhere else,but what you willget at the end of itwill be clarity.âThis thing works for me. By focusing on this thing,I can get theattention of people, and this thing must always be in my control.â And then,the next 100 videos.In a week, if you release just 2 videos, the next 100 videoswill be done within a year.And that one year,you will have to give ittowards your YouTube journey.I have given 5 years to YouTube before I broke out.I started my YouTubechannel in August 2017 with zero subscribers,and 3 years of hard work,till 2020, got me to 7,000 subscribers.Why?Because I did notfollow this strategy.I put out videos randomly,without any thought,in English, on any subject, with any understanding, and what I then gotwere people that liked mebut didn't really knowwhat I was representing.And then, in the middle of 2020,I change the game.I created a team, conducted the research.Itâs almost as if westarted from scratch. The first month, understanding what works.Then, testing out videos, figuring out what works for us,and that was a combination of Hinglish videosso that we couldfocus on our strength. Number 2:Videos around thingslike the mistakes I made andmy learnings from those them.Mistakes around money,mistakes around career, mistakes around life, and that started the journey.And then, every week,3 videos.Whether it was hotor coldor raining or an earthquake, those 3 videoswere sent out, and that is what has got us to nearly 3 million subscribers in the last 3 years.3 million in 3 years,meaning adding 1 millionsubscribers every year.It's not a joke, and it became possible because we followed a strategy,and here are the five thingsaround that strategy.Number 1: Consistency. Consistency not for your audience but for YouTube.YouTube is an extremely shameless audience.YouTube is a shameless platform. It does not love you.It does not carewho is Ankur Warikoo.It does not care who is Bhuvan. It is not care who is Ranveer. It does not carewho is CarryMinati.YouTube cares onlyabout one thing, that how much time people spend on its platform.Now, when peoplecome to the platform, what do they watch that makes them spend time? If they watch CarryMinati, very good.YouTube thinks that there issomething inCarryMinatiâs videosthrough which peoplestay on YouTube, or Ankur Warikoo has somethingwhich makes peoplestay on YouTube.It loves just one thing,that how long peoplestay on YouTubebecause the longerpeople stay on YouTube,the more videos they will watch.The more videos they watch, the more ads they will watch, even Ankur Warikooâs ads, and the more ads they watch,the more money YouTube will earn, and that is the onlything that YouTube cares about. So, consistencyensures that YouTubeproperly understands your channel.In a way, it knows thatevery Tuesday,Thursday and Saturday, from Ankur Warikooâs channel, one video will be sent out.And whenever it is sent out,it will most likelyperform this way.And because I know itwill perform this way,I can divert peopletowards that channel. This is the confidencethat the platform needs from you and it will only happen when you are consistent.If you post 5 shorts in a week,then the second week,you don't post anything.The third week, you post 2 shorts.The fourth week,you post 7 shorts. After that,your exams are going on, or you got busy in your work,so you posted nothingfor two weeks.Then, YouTube will belike, âYou know what,whenever the video will be posted, we will deal with it then.No need to work on it now.No need to understandit right now.â And your inconsistencywill become your biggest weakness.Number 2: Quality,and when I say quality,people often feel that qualityis about the quality of the camera,quality of the lights,quality of the sound, quality of the background,quality of the skin of that person,quality of their hair,quality of their t-shirt.No, my friend.People want just one thing. The quality of the content,and the quality ofthe content meanswhat they want toexperience at that moment,you provide them with it.Whether it's comedy,entertainment, news, knowledge,or anything else,whatever they want to learn, understand, that thing, in amazing quality, you can teach them.And what are thecomponents of that?Number 1: Content itself.You research well,or you prepare well,or you think well,and present that content.Number 2: Editing,where you tightly package it and you understand, through your research, what are the elementswhich people like.How do you hook people?When you show people enthusiasm, or you make them afraid,or you make them laugh,then they are bound to feel a lot more hooked.But if you are just normallytelling something to people,giving information, however valuable it is,people will feel,âIt was good.â,but they won't shareit with other people.And the more they don'tshare it with other people, the more your videowill not reach more people,and if it does not reach them,and if it does not reach them,so that will thennever grow your channel.Number 3: Data.YouTube is a platformthat is filled with data,and you are provided so much datathat you might evenstop watching it. About every video, YouTube will tell youhow many peoplesaw this thumbnail,how many people clickedon the thumbnail,how many peoplewatched the video,what was the average duration for which they watched it,at what points theviewer count started falling,which is called retention.Along with this,the total watch time,or for how manyhours cumulativelypeople watched this video.And that will be broken down intofrom where,from which device, from which search query,where did the see thevideo when they clicked it,and so much more.Why is the important? Itâs important because this datamakes you smarter.This data shows you the people you can target your videos for,the people you can makeyour videos for becausethey are the ones who watch it, they appreciate this topic more,and that becomesthe powerful thingthat YouTube gives youfor free,and you have to use it.Number 4: Thumbnails and titles. Your thumbnails and titles are an introduction.They are a type of an ad.People do not knowwhat is in that video, but after watching that imageand reading that title, they imaginewhat could be in this video. When they click it,that meansyou fulfilled a certain promisethat they held for that video.And that is whyit becomes importantfor you to focus a loton thumbnails and titles,something that wedid from day one and I would do itall over againif I had to createthis YouTube channel from scratch.And then finally,number 5:Fulfilling the promise.What does it mean?Suppose I want to show you avideo about personal finance,and I want to tell you how youcan invest in mutual funds,and I write on the thumbnail,âYou can become a crorepati.âAnd I write in the title, âEarn 1 crore rupees today.âA lot of people will click itbecause they want toearn one crore rupees.And then, when they click it,they watch a video,and this video is aboutmutual fund investing where after 20-25 years,the SIPs you made,through them, you willbecome a crorepati.Will people feel that you violated their belief?Will they feel that thefaith they had in you, it was misused? Yes.You did not fulfil the promise.The promise you maketo the people inthumbnail and title,you must fulfil thatpromise in the video.And that is somethingwhich the YouTubealgorithm will ensure,because if your CTR, meaning Click Through Rate,the people who see yourthumbnail and click it, if it is high, but after clicking it andwatching it for 20-50 seconds,they move on,then YouTube willautomatically knowthat you are creatingclickbait thumbnails or titles.But if your CTR is high, and people click on it andwatch the video for 5-10 minutes, then YouTube will knowthat you fulfilled your promise,  and they will then love you for that.Following the 1-3-10-100 approachand keeping these5 principles in mind,I can start myYouTube channel again,and something that we did.One year ago, we started ourchannel of YouTube shorts,which is at nearly5.5 lakh subscribers today.And we never tried to advertisethis shorts channelon our main channel.And that will be testimony to the fact that wehave understood howto play this gameall over again, and that is the same messagethat I am sharing with you.YouTube has many other details,and to understandall these details,we launched a proper course called How to YouTube.Often, I do not talk aboutmy courses in my videos,but because this video isspecifically about YouTube, just for one moment,I want to talk about this course.This course has20+ hours of content. In this, me and my team,whatever we havelearnt about YouTube,we have shared it with all of you,and it is something that wefundamentally believeis the mostcomprehensive YouTubecreator schoolthat this country has,and I would love for youto test it out.How would you test it out?You can buy this course. It has live classes,recorded classes,lifetime access,but most importantly, 100% refund policy. If you do not like this course,you can get 100%of your money back if you send us an email and let us know, âI want my money back.â No questions will be asked.This is our commitmentso that we deliver highest quality impact for all of youwho want to start a content journey, a personal brand journey,or a side income journeythrough YouTube,and I genuinely believe there is no better platformin the world right nowthan YouTube to make that happen.Hopefully, this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
