Check 1 2 check 1 2Aditya in this video there will bea lot of screensharing and a lot ofvisual representations, so I will keepprompting you about what is needed where.Of course, screen recording will be therebut there will be 2by2 Matrix which I will share,but I will speak it out and you will thenhave to make it. And let me know if youhave any questions around that.Ok, let's get started.Which are those stocks which you canbuy and forget about, and they will keepgenerating great returns for you year on year?We will get to know in this video.Friends, in this video I will share withyou a very fundamental stock market investing,in fact, two fundamental metrics about life which,if you understand properly then you can bewell aware of your investing and take yourlife decisions and these two matricesare Alpha and Beta.Alpha and Beta are especially useda lot in the stock market, but whateverunderstanding I have about alpha and beta,I use them a lot for makingmy life decisions as well.How? I will tell you.What are alpha and beta?Each stock's performance is comparedto the performance of overall stockswhich is called index.Do you know that the price of stockkeeps fluctuating every secondand because of that there is volatility, right?It goes up then down then up then down.Naturally, you would want that if you areinvesting in any stock then it should havethe least volatility because you want totake the least risk. You wouldn't want thatyour money goes up by â¹10 in one secondand in the other second it goes down by â¹10,then up by â¹20 and the other seconddown by â¹20, because that kind of messeswith our minds and we don't want to be inthat situation. So what you want is somesort of stability but you have to makesome compromises for stability.Which is the most stable investmentthat I hate? Fixed deposit.A fixed deposit gives you anabsolutely stable return, 4-5-6%.There is no risk involved so your volatility is 0.You will be getting the same returnon the first day and on later days as well.There is zero risk involved but yourreturn is also less because of that.This is the basis for the stock marketand I would argue the basis for life in general.If you are not ready to take more risksthen you will have to be happy withfewer returns. If you are ready to takemore risks then you can experiencemore returns as well. Understanding all of thisis through these two matricescalled alpha and beta.If a stock market is able to beat the index,which means let's say in the last 5 yearsthe index has grown by 20%, I am just usingnumbers, but one stock gave a return of 25%in the last 5 years, which means it beatthe market by 5%. This difference betweenthe stock return and index return is called Alpha.This difference can be zero which meansthat the stock and the index grew atthe same rate, so you will not get anythingmore than the index.This Alpha can be greater than 0 as well,which means the stock beat the index.It beat the index by how much, that isthe number Alpha, which is in percentage.So if it beat it by 5% then Alpha is 5%,if it beat by 20% then the answer is 20,that is how Alpha is calculated.And it can be negative as well.Which means the index was growing ata certain rate but this stock did not growat the same rate, so let's say an alpha of -5,which means that this stock gave 5% less returnthan what the index gave, that is alpha.Now unfortunately, whenever we talkabout investing, especially if you havejust started investing you tendto focus only on Alpha.How much is the return?That is why in the recent past there wassuch a massive craze around cryptocurrency.Why? Because everybody wastalking about returns.It's giving such a great return!50% in one month, 100% in two months,whatever the case is. So, everyone wascentered on Alpha Alpha Alpha.They forgot about the second importantmetric which is beta.Beta is the measurement of risk or volatility.Look at the stock market it keeps fluctuating,and the up-down seen in the index graphis assumed to be a Beta of 1.If your stock is more volatile thanthis index fund, which means it goes upwith as much speed as it comes down.Let's say if the stock market goes upby 5% then this stock goes up by 10%,but that if the stock market goes downby 5% then this stock marketâ¦If the stock market goes up at 5% whenyour stock goes up by 10%, if the stock marketgoes down by 5% when your stockgoes down by 10%, this is volatility.The measurement of volatility,the measurement of risk is called beta.So, focus not just only on Alphabut also on beta in life.You may be getting a lot of Alpha,a lot of return, but it would come alongwith a lot of Beta as well andthat is the reality of life.Higher returns mean higher risks.Lower returns mean lower risks.Now to understand this and to seehow you can carve out your investmentthesis, imagine a 2by2 matrix.You can see this 2by2 matrix on the screen also.On the x-axis we have Alpha, which meanswhile we will keep zero in the middle,we will see negative on the left-hand sidewhich will show all the stocks which havegiven lesser return than the stock market,and then positive would be upward fromzero on the right-hand side which meansall the stocks which gave more returnthan the stock market.And then on the y-axis, we will have Beta.In the center there would be 1, that isbeta which is exactly equal to the stock market,which means this stock was at as much riskas the stock market. If it is more than 1,then it means it is riskier than the market,and if it is less than 1, then it meansit is less risky than the market.Now, you have 4 quadrants and the question is,which I'm trying to answer in this video,which are those stocks that you can buyand forget about them so that youenjoy minimal risk and maximum return,which means the lowest Beta and highest Alpha.That is what you have to do, right?So, letâs see how this pans out.The first one, low Alpha low Beta.Which means a stock which is unableto beat the index and it is not very riskyas well. So, what is the point of these stocks?And mostly one should not buy these stocks.The only reason one would buy these stocksis if they have a great dividend yield,which means it is not generating incomefor you on the basis of stock price,instead it generates incomeon the basis of dividend.I made a video on dividends,where you can subscribe todividend smallcases, where you subscribeto stocks which give you dividendsevery year or every quarter just forowning the stocks. You donât haveto do anything else, neither buymore of those stocks nor sell them.You get an amount directly in yourbank account just sitting at home,through that dividend wheneverit is announced whether yearlyor quarterly or whenever.Second is low Alpha high Beta.A stock that doesn't grow muchbut is very risky. Now only a foolishwill be such a stock.Who would be interestedWho would be interested in such stocks?Day-traders.In trading, especially day-trading isalmost always pegged on high beta, why?Because there is too much volatility,too much fluctuation, so they willbet on the fact that if the price of thestock goes up today then they will sell it,or if it goes down then they will buy it,and we will move our money withinone day itself before the settlementand we will make our money.It doesn't matter to them whether this stock,in the long run, beats the index or not.It doesn't matter to them whether thestock is better than the stock market or not.It doesn't matter to them if its Alpha is lowor the return is low, they are centeredaround high beta, which means it is very risky,and its price will fluctuate,and within a day they will make money.Then you go to the third quadrantwhich is high alpha and high beta,which means it had growth but italso comes with high risk.Now, these are the stocks that willforce you to do active trading.A momentum strategy is driven by this.I am a big investor in momentum strategy,would not recommend it for someonejust starting up, but I personally do itbecause I am ready to take the risk.It basically bets on the stocks whichare growing very rapidly, beating the market,but it is also possible that if the market goes down,these stocks will also go down withthat much speed. There is a certain riskattached to this strategy and this requiresyou to be actively trading, which meansyou will have to keep looking at yourportfolio again and again. I change thisportfolio of mine every week through smallcase,I needn't do it by myself, but I have to do thatand this is what is called active trading.Then comes the fourth and the mostinteresting quadrant, which is thefocus of today's video andthat is passive trading.Passive trading means you buy somestocks and then forget about themfor 5-10-20 years. These stocks will keepgiving you great returns year on year,you will be sitting on enough and morecorpus at the end of that period andthis will set you up for retirement.These are the best stocks because theirAlpha is high but Beta is low, which meansit will beat the market but not takea lot of risks. This is great! It is almostlike FD in the best way that it could have been,not the FD that it is today,please don't buy an FD,issued in public interest.So, what you want to do is passive trading.And I will show you today,how can you choose stocks,which you can buy onceand forget about them.The only caveat here is the following:Alpha and Beta are historic metrics,which means all the calculation aboutwhat is the Alpha and Beta of a stock isbased on what has already happened.How much did it beat the market?How much was its volatility?Which means it is not necessarythat it can predict the future as well.So, whenever you are taking a call,you still have to be somewhat active butnot as active as the active trading quadrantwhich is of high Alpha and high Beta.Which means, my suggestion would be,if you buy these stocks, check them inevery quarter whether everything is fine,numbers are what you had expected. If yes,forget them again for 3 months, come back,and do this. Now, to assess this,Iâll go to the screen and we will figure outhow to pick these stocks.So, what Iâm going to use for all thedata is tickertape.in. It has a productcalled Screener which is a brilliant productand I use it for almost all my analysis,whatever I need to do.So, letâs start.What you are basically doing is,and I had already prepared this screen, I essentiallyâ¦Actually, let me justOk, start from here Aditya, ok.When you would go on Screener,you will see all the stocks, 4361,which are there in Indian stock exchange.What is the sector?What is the market cap?Which means what is the value of the company?Closing price, which meanswhat was the last price of the stock?And PE ratio which is the price to earnings ratio?We will not focus on theses things,we will play the game around alpha and beta.And weâll see how it works.Firstly, Iâll add a filter,and this is an important filter,I want revenue growth.And I will take the revenue growthfor 5 years because that is somethingthat I want, and when I go torevenue growth, I'll consider onlythose companies which had apositive revenue growth. I don't wantpeople that have been declining becausewhy would I choose such a stock?Then I will go and add Alpha.So here is alpha, you can see,an excess return of a stock relativeto its benchmark. Benchmark, in this case,is the stock exchange, calculated usinga 104-week average, which meansby how much did this stock beatthe index in the past two years or not,is the measurement of Alpha.That is done and then I will goand choose beta.When we choose beta we see,beta is the measure of a company's stock pricevolatility relative to the market,which means how much does it fluctuaterelative to the market, that is most important.So, this is what it is.Now when you look at all of this, let'sfirst sort them by your 5-year historical growth.Then you can see a company calledEast Coast Limited, which are never heard of,it has it as 165. Now, when you see this,you will also see that some of themdon't even have a beta, but if beta is 3,which means if the market goes up by 5%then this stock would go up by 15%,if the market goes down by 5% thenthis stock would go down by 15%.Too risky! I don't want this risk.I want stocks that are between 0 to 1or maximum till 1.5 so that I workwith minimal risk.The best way to do that is to go large-cap,which means all the big companieswhich have good 5-year growthand since they are big companies,they are stable too, so I can assumethat they will be working for 10-20 years,so on and so forth.And let me then sort them by market cap.I will export all of this because then we willplay in Excel and enjoy ourselves.So this is our Excel sheetSo this is our Excel sheet and let'szoom in a little so that you are able to see,and these are your filters and then you can.So first of all, what we will do if wewill first look at every large-capwhose beta we have.So we will remove all the blanks.Then we will sort them,so we want maximum Alphaso we will then sort it by largest.Now our game is that we wantthe largest Alpha with the lowest beta.So when you look at say,Adani Enterprises.The Alpha of Adani Enterprises is fantastic,73, which means it beat the market by 73%which is phenomenal, but its beta isalso 1.76 which is almost near 2,so if the market is up by 5% then thiswill be up by 10% and if the marketis down by 5% then this will be down by 10%.Still, in my opinion, a lot of volatility.Now how do we figure this out?Best would be to plot it becausethat is the easiest way to do it,so we will do a scatter plot.So we will move the scatter plotto a new sheet.When you do that, then you can seeAlpha which is on the x-axisand this is beta. What you want ismaximum Alpha but beta which is around 1,which means it is more or lessgiving you the market risk.You are not taking more risk than that,but it is still beating the market.So when I look at this number,what number is this, beta of 48 but, sorryAlpha of 48 but beta of only 0.94,which means it beat the market by 48%,but its volatility is less than the market,which means it is taking lesser riskthan the market. This is great!Let's see which one is this.You will go on 48 and it isApollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited.And now I will go and see for Apollo.This is sorted by Alpha, right?So I will sort it by Alpha andsort it by alpha andthen this is Apollo Hospitals.If you look at Apollo Hospital,then you can see very consistent growth,very nicely done, 3341% growth,intrinsic value, everything is very good,there is very little, there PE ratio isalso very good, price and earnings ratio,so this is definitely something that I wouldwant to consider and of course it becomesa nice happy investment, so we willbookmark this, and you can, of course,add it to whatever it is, so I am goingto say long-term stocks.This is done!Now the same way, we will keep checkingwhat are the other ones which you want.Let's look at this one, it has an alpha of 51.81and a beta of 1.049, which means it hasa risk as much as the index,but it beat the market by 51%.Which one is it? Gujarat Gas.Now you won't have even knownall of these but that is a fascinatingthing about alpha and beta.So, when you look at this it has grownits revenue by 10% on an average every yearfor the last 5 years which is great growth.It beat the market by 51, so if I go to Gujarat Gas.So, let's go to Gujarat Gas andSo, let's go to Gujarat Gas and see itsperformance is, wow! Its performance seems like,ok if you go in there and I do max then wow!You look at this, not a lot of volatility,6832% return so it definitely is somethingthat I would want. It is a large cap.It is in utilities, gas distribution.Gas is something which is the future,it will definitely replace all your fuelssooner than later.So, you will essentially get a senseof all of these stocks in a way that isdetermined by Alpha, which meanshow rapidly is it beating the market,and beta, which means how muchrisk does it take.Your goal always is to be in this spot.This is where you would want to be.And you will see that almost all thegood stocks that are therewhich have given consistent returnsare in the same space.If I sort it by market cap, then youwill all these large-caps.So you will see Reliance with an Alpha of 11,which means it has beaten the market by 11%,and a beta of 1.14, which means justa bit more risk than the market,so I would love this company. Why not?And we all know Reliance issomething which is great.If you look at TCS, it is ridiculous!12 if the Alpha which means it hasbeaten the market by 12% anda beta of only 0.8 which meanslesser risk than the market.I would love this stock.Who wouldn't love this stock?Because it is in a quadrant wherealpha is high and beta is low.It's the best place to be.Everyone would want to be in that spot,which is why this would be an absolute pickif you want to buy a stock and forget about it.HDFC, not so much, last five years,not so much, -0.46 means it did notbeat the market.If you look at Infosys, ridiculous!Alpha of 23, which means it beat themarket by 23% and a beta of only 0.62which means lesser risk than the market.All of these are fantastic picks if youdo not want to take risks and you wantyour money to consistently grow throughthe performance of the company.This my friend, is the classic way ofinvesting for the long term.If you buy any stock whose alpha is great,or in any asset class, whether it iscrypto or real estate or gold or anything else,whose alpha you think is greatbut you invested without knowing the beta,then you are making a half-baked decision.That is not what wise investors do.I hope this was useful.I hope this was useful not just forinvesting but in general for life.Whenever you have to take a big decision,ask yourself that, âI understood the alpha,which is why Iâm even interested in thedecision but what is its beta?If I want to go and change this company,if I want to go and change my job,if I want to go and change my stream,if I want to go into a new relationship,whatâs the growth that I can get, I get that.Thatâs the alpha.What is the risk that Iâm taking?What is the beta of that?Your focus should be maximizing alphawhile minimizing beta.This is the game to play.And your choices and decisions in lifeshould be driven by, âHow can I getthe most growth, the most alphawith the lowest risk, with the lowest beta?âOn that note, Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
