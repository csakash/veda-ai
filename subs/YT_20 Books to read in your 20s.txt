And I think thisbook is just such a brilliant representationof our life through a dying personâs life.I will start all over again.First is, âTuesdays With Morrieâ, this book is byMitch Albom. Mitch tells the story about herprofessor whose name is Morrie. Morrie is actuallydying and, on every Tuesday, for many months,Mitch and Morrie would sit down and talk about life.Itâs a beautiful book, one of the best books thatI have read and I read it very early on,left a deep meaning impact on my life.Two, itâs not a book but I would have read it in 20s,my life would have changed a lot.âThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ckâ, it is one of thebest humor-filled life books, where it is simplysaying that, donât load on everything,donât react too much on everything. Itâs actuallyOK to live life without having ambitions,without having an urge to make a lot of money.Itâs OK to actually be a loser in life. Itâs quite afascinating book with a different take on life.Mark Manson is a very powerful writer. If you are inyour 20s, this is a strongly recommended book.Third, âThe Alchemistâ, must have heard of it,maybe you have read it already. If you havenât,then it is a very powerful book. It is basicallyabout affirmations. A technique which is like,âwhen you wish something with all you heart,then the whole universe works towards giving you thatâ,something like that. The dialogue by Sharukh Khanwas basically from the book Alchemist,itâs exactly almost like that but itâs not so muchabout wishful thinking or all that. A genuine andpractical way of thinking about, when youwholeheartedly wish for something thenhow do things move to make it happen.Fourth, âManâs Search for Meaningâ, very powerfulbut a very heavy book. It is a book by Viktor Frankl.He was jailed in Nazi Germany, he was Jewish andwhile he was in the concentration camp,not in jail sorry in concentration camp,while in the concentration camp, he changedthe perspective towards life to a great deal,because everywhere he could only seedeaths, sadness, depression, hopelessness.Despite of all this, he tries to find meaning in his life.If someone reads this book in their 20s,then they get a perspective, they actually geta clarity in life that what actually is life.You can get all these books as part of my giveawayfor this video. You only go to the end of this video,comment the name of that book among in thesetwenty in the comment section, which you wantwith the reason why. If your book and your reasonmatch my random selection, then you will get thisbook hand delivered to your doorstep from my side.Fifth, âHow to Win Friends and Influence Peopleâ,book by Carnegie. Itâs a good book, itâs obviousby the name, its such a practical way of goingabout making relationships and friendships.How through your personality and communication skills,you can influence people? It is a toolkit for life, must read.Sixth, âQuiet:The Power of Introvertsâ. The reality isall of us feel that only extroverts rule the world,everything is around the people who are confident,pride of every party, speak everything on the stage,but if you are an introvert, which almost 40-50% of the world is,then you shouldnât feel that you wonât be able toachieve anything in life. The book Quiet is solelyfocused on that. If you are an introvert and you arestruggling to find how your identity can impactthe world, then this book is absolutely for you.Number 7, one of my best books when I read it early on.âWait How Do I Write This Email?â, that isactually a book. I have made a lot of videos oncold emailing and this book is specifically on this,that how can you adopt powerful written communication?Email is still a great way for you to reach out topeople who you donât know, for jobs, for internships,for opportunities, for funding, for whatever you need.And this book lays it out and lays it out so well.In a way I have trained myself through this book andI loved the book when I read it, I donât even remember,maybe I read it in the 1st or 2nd year of college.After that, write an email for every reason to whoever,I think I have the dubious distinction that I havewritten an email to all the rich and famous peopleof the world, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mukesh Ambani,Narendra Modi, I didnât get an answer to a lot ofemails but it is surprising how many people haveactually written back which I was not even expecting.Number 8, Linchpin, according to me Seth Godin isthe deepest thinker who I know of, he doesnât know me,I know him, and Linchpin is his best book according to me.It is about, how in an organisation, you can becomethe most important part, because a machine is madeup of different parts and we feel that this part is very small,it is useless, it is not valuable, but you can actuallymake a difference by the way that you approachyour work and Linchpin is around that only.For someone in their 20s, if you get the clarity thathow you work can define your existence,what is the approach towards becoming a thoroughworking professional, each person should feel thatyou are not dispensable, itâs not like we can firethis person whenever we want, because they bringto the table so valuable that we can never predictor imagine. That is who you want tobecome and that is what Linchpin teaches you.Number 9, âStart With Whyâ, Simon Sinek is avery deep thinker, one of my favorite peoplewhen it comes to making presentations aroundpeople, culture, organisations, leadership,and Start With Why is inspired by his famous theory ofThe Golden Circle. Golden Circle means that all thepowerful leaders, powerful companies, powerful brandsalways start with why. Why do we exist?Why does it matter? Why are we in this?Why do we get up every day? Why are we doing this?And since they are able to narrate and establishtheir Why properly, their What and How is eventuallyfigured out easily. Start With Why and that is alsovery important if you are in 20s if you choosing acareer, choosing a partner, if you start with why,suddenly everything becomes very very clear.Number 10, Mindset, when I read this book, I think,you know when you read some books, they justopen up your mind, like you are like, you nowknow something which is so meaningful that youare almost beginning a second life. That is whathappened when I read this book called the Mindset.It is a book by Carol Dweck. If you have heard aboutgrowth or fixed mindset, then this book is about that.Growth mindset is a mindset where a personbelieves that the IQ and the capability that hewas born with, that is not his limit, they canbecome whosoever they want to become
was born with, that is not his limit, they canbecome whosoever they want to becomebecause they have the ability to grow,
become whosoever they want to becomebecause they have the ability to grow,and fixed mindset are all those people whofeel that they can reach the IQ, the capabilitythey were born with, not beyond that,it doesnât matter whatever they do, they will remainwhere they were, and that difference makesall the difference.

Unbelievably inspirational!That how a person from such a humble backgroundbecomes a rocket scientist and then finally thepresident of this country, and with such humility,such an inspiring man. For me, APJ standsas the testimony of, if you take a strong decision that youwant to be somewhere, then nothing can stop you.Another biography at number 18,Another biography at number 18,âBeyond the Last Blue Mountainâ, this is theautobiography of JRD Tata, well itâs a biography,itâs an official biography so it can be called an
