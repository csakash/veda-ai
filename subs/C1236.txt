Number 2: This area,which is basically thebalcony and the sofa. This is where I meditate.And there is one lovelyexercise that I also do here.What I love about this iswe have a wind chimewhich makes a beautiful sound if there is a breeze in the morning.There is greenery here.It's a great start to the day, and there is expansebecause an entire living roomand a dining area setup is there. What I do isI sit here,and this is where I meditate.I sit in the morning for 30 minutes,I meditate hereand I love it.With the tree or the plant,the sound of the wind chime, by using the Calm app,I listen to the sounds of water,sparrows and the wind, and I meditate, and itâs a wonderful start to the day.I also like this spotbecause here, if I have to read, and itâs like some loungey reading,I don't need to payattention while reading,or it's just entertainment readingor something that Iam happy to consume. So, this mode becomes my reading mode. So, I lie downand put my Kindle in my hand, I read as much as I can.Light comes from far away.Light comes from behind me. There are lots of elements around me. Again, it's a big space, and that helps me be very focused, and at the same time,be very productive.
