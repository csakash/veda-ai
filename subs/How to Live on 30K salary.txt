In this video, let's play with excel.Imagine your salary isâ¹30,000 a month,and we will divide it in 3 parts. 1. Needs2. Wants3. Investments Needs, the things you need.All the things that youneed to spend on to survive. It could be your rent.It could be an EMI.It could be electricityand water bills.It could be expenses forfood and beverages, so on. Second: Wants.Second: Wants.Desires.Second: Wants. Desires.These are the thingsyou want in life.And what is thepoint of a life whereyou made large investmentsso that you become acrorepati in your old agebut you don't have any teeth left, you cannot walk,you have nothing else left. So, while living life,you also have to be happy.So, buying a phone,going on a vacation,buying good clothes, eating out,all those things in wants.And third, Investments for the future. All the big expenses.Buying a house,getting married, completing your education,maybe education of your kids, getting your kids married, planning for retirement,for all those things,your investment plan.We will divide thesethree in a 50:30:20 ratio.So, in a salary of â¹30,000,â¹15,000 rupees for needs, â¹9,000 rupees for wants, â¹6,000 rupees for investments.And then, we will see how the salary grows.So, I have assumed,you can change thegreen cells as you wish, that the first 10 years,you will get anincrement of nearly 10%.Then, of course,it will keep going down becausethe base would be large enough.So, the next 10 years, 8%.Then, 6%. Then, 4%.Then, 4%.So, in a way,the increment growthwould become flat.And when you willget that increment,you will not spend itin the 50:30:20 ratio because that would be stupid.With an increase in your salary,if you are needs anddesires are increasing,then you areneglecting your future. So, what I have assumed iswhenever you get an increment,you will share equal halves,not equal halves,equal sharesamong needs, wantsand investments.We have assumedinflation to be 6%. So, how does it translate into an actual sheet? Let's see the budget.Now, in this budget, we are starting in 2023.The year is zero.Our salary is â¹3,60,000,which is basically â¹30,000 a month.We have divided it inâ¹15,000, â¹9,000 and â¹6,000which is the 50:30:20 ratio.Now, the next year,we get an increment of 10%,. Now, the next year, weget an increment of 10%,meaning with this â¹3,60,000, we get â¹36,000 extra per year.We will divide this â¹36,000in three parts of â¹12,000 each,which means â¹1,000 in every share. So, â¹15,000 would become â¹16,000,â¹9,000 would become â¹10,000,â¹6,000 would become â¹7,000,and this is howwe will actually split this.Now, if you create a new ratio,it will not be the 50:30:20 ratio. The needs are now 48%,wants is the same at 30%,and investments have grown to 21%.If you do this every year,then you will seea different number. And let's seeif this looks realistic or not? So, after 10 years,your salary would be nearly â¹8,50,000which sounds about reasonable.Starting from â¹3,60,000, increasing at 10% every year.So, after 10 years,â¹8,50,000.And out of that, you will spend nearly â¹31,000on your needs,nearly â¹25,000 on your wants,and nearly â¹22,000will be invested.Sounds about reasonable.Then, let's see after 20 years.After 20 years,your salary would benearly â¹19,00,000.Out of that, â¹60,000 a monthwill be for needs,â¹55,000 for wants,and nearly â¹50,000 for investments.Let's see what happensafter 30 years.Your salary hasincreased to â¹34,00,000.It looks like a big amount. Starting from â¹3,60,000and getting to â¹34,00,000,but this is after30 years, my friend.Everything will grow.We will adjust it forinflation as well.So, â¹1,04,000 a month for needs,nearly â¹1,00,000 for wants, and nearly â¹1,00,000for investments,and it will continue.So, if you see after 50 years,after 50 years,your salary would be â¹75,00,000.It looks like a big amount.I know it,but after 50 years,you will be earning this amount.That's provided if you wantto work for 50 years or not.And at that point,it would be innearly equal shares.So, we will be spendingâ¹2,20,000 on our needs,â¹2,16,000 on our wants,and â¹2,13,000 on our investments every month.Now, we have to seehow this works.Let's look at first, needs.So, we are startingwith â¹15,000 rupees.And what are ournecessary expenses?It can be rent, it can be food,it can be electricity,it can be mobile, it can be clothes,it can be transportation,it can be internet.So, I have laid out anapproximate plan for a month. â¹7,000 a month for rent,because I am assuming thatyou are just beginning.You are a bacheloror a bachelorette.So, in a shared apartment room,maybe in a double occupancy,â¹7,000 month evenin a tier one citylike Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, you will get it.Of course,Of course, the livingstandards may not be as great but it is possible.If you cook at home,then it would costyou nearly â¹100 a dayfrom a food perspective.Electricity will beshared with everyone, â¹500 on an average.Mobile bill is nearly â¹500 a month.You may spend â¹500 on clothes. Transportation is quite expensive.If you use public transport,then it will costyou nearly â¹1,500, but if you use an auto or an Uber/Ola,then it could be nearly â¹3,000, particularly if you owna bike or scooty. And then, for internet,nearly â¹500 rupees a month,which means â¹15,000a month will bespent on your needsand it seems like somethingwe can achieve.Now, you have to keep this numberaside for yourself every month. So, every year,this amount increases,and you will haveto see how do youfit this amountinto your expenses.I'll change all these to zeroso that you can fill them yourself. Then, let's go to wants. What are the wants?Wants are the thingsyou want to do,of which I havetaken some examples.You want to buy a car or a bike.You want to buy a phone.You want to go on a vacation.You want to buy clothesbeyond the clothes you need. You want to party.You want to eat out. So, the first year,â¹9,000 rupees a monthwas our budget for this.What we will do? Suppose you want to buy a bikeor you want to buy a scooty.So, â¹3,000 a monthwould be its EMI.This EMI would notbe part of the needs. This is your desire. This is something that you have chosen to do.This is not a needbecause we have allotted â¹3,000separately for transportation.This is over and above that.If you want to buyan expensive phone, then you pay â¹3,000 as its EMI.You can opt for zero cost EMI,or you can savethese â¹3,000 rupees,and after 6 months,you can buy a phone for â¹18,000,or after a year,you can buy a phone for â¹36,000.Itâs your wish.For vacation,you saved â¹1,000,or whatever you want to save.You can make it â¹1,500.So, you know thatat the end of the year, you cango for a vacation with â¹18,000. For clothes, you allotted â¹500.Itâs not necessary thatyou buy every month, but let's say after 3 months,or after 6 months,you bought clothesfor â¹1,500-3,000.Every month, you spendâ¹1,000 to go out,this will not be lavish,it won't be like you canafford the best 5-star hotelsor high-end restaurants, but in this salary, in the beginning,we can only spend this much.And the idea of that budget is to be disciplined around that.So, this is our â¹9,000for wants.Now, let's go to investments. Now, for the rest of the money, you need to plan. So, every year,how you plan every month is something that needs to be figured out. Now, let's come to investments.This is where it becomesreally interesting.Let's look at what isthe investment scene.First of all, we willtry to understand where will we invest.I have assumed basicallythat stock market isa good place to bebecause I am assumingyou are young,you can get started, you are ready to take some risk,plus you are planningfor the long term.So, it's not like you will investfor a year andthen you will stop.You are investing forat least 5-10 years.And that's why, this is a good investment to make.But even in this,there are varying levels of risk. So, you can invest instocks which are relatively stable or safer.These are calledthe Nifty 50 stocks.These are investments inIndia's top 50 companies.So, your usual suspects likeReliance, TATA, HDFC, SBI,so on and so forth,or you can takesome risk by saying,âI want to invest inmid-sized companies. There will be fluctuations but over a long period of time, it gives me better returns,and that's why I amokay to do that.â Or you could say,âI am ready to take even more risk.I will invest insmall-sized companies.There will be large fluctuationbut over a period of time, it will give me better returns.âSo, here is what I would suggest. The allocation to be 60:25:15. You can change this.You can invest 100% of this in Nifty 50.You can invest,I will not suggest this,but you can takethe highest risk andput everything insmall cap, whatever. On an average,if we look at theIndian stock market,then approximately,on a yearly basis,these are the returns that these caped industries/companieshave given.So, 12% on an average, Nifty 50.15% on an average, midcap. 18% on an average, small cap.So, if our starting investment is â¹6,000,which we have planned forevery month of year one,then we will invest â¹3,600 in Nifty 50 every month,â¹1,500 rupees in midcap, â¹900 in small cap.On an average, ourreturn will be about13.65%.Our inflation is 6%.If you move forward with this setup, if you look at this entire budget and make this investment, these are the returns you will get at the end of these intervals.After 10 years,you would have nearly â¹29,00,000 in your bank account,which adjusted for inflationwould be â¹16,00,000of value today. Now, that after 10 years could be a good way for you to make a down payment for a home,and if youare starting this atthe age of 22 or 23,then buying a houseat the age of 30 or 32is a great idea.â¹16,00,000 as down paymentand the rest â¹50,00,000-70,00,000could be a loan,and you would be able to buya house for â¹1,00,00,000,or if you want towait a little longer, let's say 15 years, then you will havethis â¹28,00,000 jump to â¹78,00,000, which would be â¹32,00,000 in today's value.Now, â¹78,00,000 wouldbe your down payment then, but at today's value,it would be equivalent ofâ¹32,00,000 as down payment,meaning if youbuy a house today of â¹1,00,00,000 or â¹1,50,00,000,then you will be able to payâ¹32,00,000 as down payment,and the actual amount at thatpoint would be â¹78,00,000.If you wait even more, for 20 years, which is what I did,we bought our house,I bought,actually I and my wifebought our house together. At the age of 39,we bought our house.Before that, we rented a house,and that 20-yearperiod of investingwould give you â¹1,90,00,000. â¹2,00,00,000which will have a valueof â¹60,00,000 today,and you see how that grows. This is after taking into account all reasonable expectations.Of course, the returnwould not be steady,but if we, these are conservative returns, I have not exaggerated them,but you can still be a crorepatiwith starting salary of just â¹30,000.Wherever you are,Delhi, Bangalore,Mumbai, or anywhere else, the idea isto budget, the idea is to be disciplined around your money.So, a quick recap.You would split these â¹30,000You would split these â¹30,000 in needs, wants, and investments in a 50:30:20 ratio.Every year, the increment you get,you will split itin 3 equal shares,33% each willgo into increasing the amount for your needs, for your wants,and for your investments.And you will keep a budgetof everythingthat you will bespending money on. When you become this disciplined, within just 5, 10, 15 years,you will have crores in bank.You would have taken careof your needs properly.You would have fulfilledall your desires, and you will have surplus money to make big purchases in life.Whether it is buying a house, or living on rent foreverand travelling internationally,or you want to continueyour education, or you want to quit your job and live on that money,whatever the case may be,you have now earnedyour financial freedom through a disciplined wayof investing moneywith just â¹30,000.I hope this was helpful.You can download thissheet for yourself.The link is in pinnedcomment and description.You do not have to use this sheetbecause I have fixed these.You will have to download it as an excel sheet,and that's how you can use it for your own benefit.
