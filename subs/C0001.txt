Recording is happening, is it?Yes, ok, backup is also thereOk, rolling, rolling, okAlright.In today's video, I have with meDipinder Goyal of ZomatoDipi, welcome to the show man.Thank you so much.Wonderful, so we willdiscuss a lot of things,of course about the book,but first, a fewthings about yourself.One question I ask every guestthat while growing up,what was your relationship with money?Had a money crisis, or a lot of money,or you didn't care about anything.From when you wereborn till you grew up,when you started earning yourself,what was the relationship likewith money in that interval?Man, there was no money.So, there was no relationship with moneyYeah, and I think in my life,money doesn't hold anykind of significance at all.Of course it's fun.Yes, of course.If it doesn't, it doesn't matter.And was it always like this?When it happens, usually,that when you grow up without money,there is a hatred for money.I'll have so much moneyin life that everyone...No, I never had that.Never?What was the driver then growing up?What were you passionateor driven towards?I think......I just wanted to have fun in lifeDo something meaningful,do something useful,and that's about it.And did you have any idea whatcould be that useful in childhood?Absolutely zero.I myself was not useful, so what could I do?I thought that I should become useful,then do something useful.And do you have brothers and sisters?I have one elder brother.Elder brother.So was he more of a helping figure or was he like,look at him,he is doing so much,you are not doing anything.He was more of a pressure person onlybecause he always used to top in schooland I always used to be at the bottom.No, you couldn't have been at the bottom.Actually trueReally?In class 5, I actually failed.In class 5?How can somebody fail in class 5?I did.I do great things.I failed in class 5 andmy dad had to go beg thethe principal of theschool to let the case go.Really?This is a marginaland it's funny, in class 8,the first semester, there wasa teacher who gave meanswers to all the questionsin the examination hall,and suddenly, there were 35 people inmy class and I was at the bottom.Now, I came third.And life changedSuddenly I got love from home, I got a girlfriend,I got respect in the society.Muktsar, this is a small town in Punjab,life changed for me, man.And I was like,"Yeah, this is a good life."So just respect and loveand then I started working hard.Wonderful, that's a fascinating thingbecause one thing that I findfascinating about you is that you are perhapsthe most indifferent towardsworking like nobody else can.Like for you, working hard seems like,because I don't knowyou personally as much,it seems like cakewalk.I can work as much asI want with my mindsetand was this incident that changedyou or has it become a habit?I actually enjoy working hard.So for a lot of people it's a loadthat I don't want to work hard, why am I studying and so on.I actually enjoy working hard.So I don't enjoy peace time.I want my back to the wall all the time.Really?Do you feel your best comes out then?I only move myself then, otherwise I won't even move.Okay.So peace is not nice.Basically, there is no chill mode.Chill mode doesn't exist.It doesn't exist, it will just happen.And, sorry, okay.And when you,Zomato started in 2009?2008And at that point of time,consulting life,basically that too was a tiring jobIt's hard work for12-16 hours a day,but in 2008, no one in thiscountry knew how to start up.Very, very few people,and they were crazy people.What drove you to that?Do you come from a business familyor do you come from that setup?I didn't do this as a startup.I didn't do this to make a company.So I just thought let's put a menu.If it's useful, it will make me happy.Let's make a website and see what happens.It's like a craft project.People would paint apainting on a weekend.I thought let's put amenu and see what happens,and one thing led to another and we landed here, man.So it's an accidental company.You know what,my triangulation is thatyou used to enjoy working hardand this was a lot of hard workwhich is what you fellin love with then perhapsDoes that mean that ifthis job becomes easy,you might stop liking it?Whether it becomes easyor not is up to you.If your ambition keeps increasing,then it won't be easy.If you temper down your ambition,then it will become easy.So what is the ambitionthat keeps you hooked on?Every year we have a new trip.Really?Which you can't;and this will be likewe are a public company.Yes exactly, you can't say public company.Can't have a forward looking statement,but how has life changed afterbecoming a public company?I think public company,being one is way easierthan being a private one.And youâre the first onewho has told me this.We were talking about this.Can you please tell the audiencewhat do you mean by that?See when you are a private company,investors come and ask you for data.They ask you for weekly stuff.So they will ask that why arethe numbers down in this week?People went on a holiday.What can I do?It's not the fault of the business.There are so many explanationsand answers you have to give.In public company, a quarterly is there.You can actually think longer term.It's not there in a private company,and the other big thing is thatin a private company,your work does matterbut a lot more thanjust your work matters.How do you polish your decks?How do you present yourself?What do you say to this guy?What do you say to that guy?How do you make this guybehave about that guy?So, there is a lot ofdrama in a private companyIn a public company, you work peacefully.And numbers.Numbers,and let the numbers speak for themselvesand think longer term.Don't optimize for the next quarter,And life will happen.So it's just very peaceful.We just can focus on our work,do high quality work,ups and downs happen,and ups and downs havenothing to do with us.We keep working.You understand this.But you;Are 7,500 peoplewho are potentiallyshareholders in the company,then 3.5 lakh peoplewho work indirectlybut for Zomato,how will you explain to themthat the stock price has gone crazyand it is not about us.It is about something elseYou have reached that point whereyou know that is the truthand it will eventually come back.It'll just show up.But a kid from24-25 years of age,it is devastating for him.Am I in the right company or not?What is going to happen?Do you think about these things?Or does it bother you?Yes and no,because I think wheneverthe stock price goes down,the first thing that I have to dois show up to work the next dayand smile.Exactly.If I look stressed,everybody else will get stressed.If I am not stressed,it doesn't pass on to the rest of the team.So, that saves the day.I don't care much.I know that long termwill take care of itself.So, it goes onThat would be so smart about;Your team drawsinspiration, courage,stamina, moralefrom you.Of course.How you behave, how you smile,how you react?And if you react,if you becomea person who is acting under pressure,the entire team will act under pressure.That's so true.I often tell founders thatwhether you like it or not,you are a celebrity,and every step you take is measured.What you are saying?How you are saying it?What you are not saying?Everything is sizedand it becomes a standard.It becomes the culture thatthen becomes how things get done.The founder is the highest barin an organization,and if the founder lowers the bar,entire organization goes down.Absolutely.So true.What is the biggest shift you haveseen in yourself as a person, Dipi?The biggest shift I have seen in myselfis thatover the last year or twois thatI have learned to let goand let people doa lot of stuffwhich otherwise I would panic.Only I can do it best,and I know that I can still dothat particular piece of work fasterand slightly betterbut it doesn't build an organization.So if I let someone elsedo the job,they will probably do their workslower and probably10-20% less as goodthe first time around.Next time, they will get better.So you have to give them the room to grow,and I think I have startedgiving people the room to grow.And how did this shiftand realization comeAnd why did it come?It was forced upon me.What can I say?There was no optionThe scale of the organizationis just way too much.I can't handle everything.I can't do everything on my own.If I could, I wouldbut I can't.What are the things you enjoy doing?What are the things you actually spend time onand you still loveshowing up every day for it.Culture.I think because culture is theOperating system of an organizationand then product,I love productand I think, yeahthat's my thing.That's your thing.You would be one of the better,if not the best product leaders out thereand I have always maintained thatin the way that it's just shownWhat prompted you todocument thisculture of yours whichI have to;So I have had theprivilege of working with a lot ofZomans,And one thing that I have seenin everyone.Irrespective of where they go,what you have saidright towards the end is,Once a Zoman, always a Zoman.They'll somehow will always be likeThis happened in Zomato.It's been years.atleast 4-5 years.I don't know if it happens or not.No, this happens in Zomato.And what I have also saidand I often quote Zomato's cultureas an example,that culture has noright or wrong definition.Culture has only a strong definition.That whoever is going into that culture,he instantly feels it.Now, whether they are aligned to it or notis a matter of discovery.If they are not aligned,maybe they will check out.If they are aligned, they will stay forever.But there is no right or wrong culturewhich is what a lot of founders mistake,That we have to make a right culture.This has to be made.Did youbecause you have had multiplefounders along the way,you have had multiplepeople who have workedvery closely with you,but you are also a verystrong figure yourself,did you ever feel a disconnectbetween the culture you wantand the one which is formingis visibleas a gap or a difference?Multiple times,andI thinkfixing a culture is a tough job.Absolutely.But we have been able todo it in a matter of few months,multiple times.So culture is aalways decaying process.It always decaysand then you have to bring it upand then it goes down further.So it's basicallyan always on job.I wrote this tomake my job easier.Read page 43And was it challengingdocumenting this or wasit always in your head?This book has beenfirst of all it was notactually supposed to be a book.This manual is,I've been working on this for a decade now.Wow!Which showsand I would highly recommend it.The beauty of books like these isthey are not just about,What is the culture of Zomato?It is about a peek into,How you build an operating systemin your wordsfor an organization that is so large,has been at it for decades,and is only continuing to grow.There is no sign of slowing down.There is no sign ofany dearth of ambition,andI loved it by the way.Congratulations.Very nicely done.But page number 47 for mewas the first thing that struck a chord,And that was,"This place is designedto make you uncomfortable.""This place is designed tomake you uncomfortable."Very few peoplewill stand up and say this,That too in a double page format.This is going to happen.You will be nervous.You will be scared.You will be questionedNothing is at face value,and I am sure that saying thisand implementing it every dayis not easy.Why is this so important for you?Because if you seek comfort,then you don't seek learning.Correct?Learning comes out ofa place of discomfort.So, that's the whole point of this.We want people who want toperpetually continue to learn.I don't want people who say,I know everything now.But that's never the case.That actually doesn't happen.So this place isdesigned to make uncomfortable.And how do you actuallytranslate that into action?Becauseat your level, I can totally again get this.Challenge me.Let's do something newthat I haven't done before.But there is a meetingon a floor of this reallylarge beautiful campus,and people thereto save their assare saying something."You are right.You are not."They are not saying the right wordsbecause it is confrontationalso that no one feels bad.What if they call my boss?There are a thousand things.Nuances of corporate politicswhich happen at scale.How do you still getsomething like this in action?In not just wordbut spirit as well.I think critical mass is necessary.Let's say 80% of the peopleare the ones who willsay the truth.Uncomfortable brain game.Right?Then the other 20% will stand out.Got it.They are the odd onesGot it.If the other way round happens,people who say the truthare the ones who stand out.Got itSo it is possible only afterachieving critical mass. This has been in the worksfor a decadebut there had to be aright timing to plan this.So right now, culturally,I felt like okay.We are feeling like this is critical mass.Now if we put a manual in this,it will sustain.Interesting.Now if the organization got a manualwhich it didn't believe in,which it said,"This is not us."Then it couldn't have workedAbsolutely.So, this was sort of a mission statementfor me all these years.We sort of got to that pointat such a large scale.Then I said, "Okay,This is what we are trying to get to,and this is where we are."Makes sense. Beautiful.Fantastic.The other page that caught my attentionwas page number 81.And page number 81was"What if you make a mistake,and what if we all make a mistake?"And this particularly I likedbecause you are now apublicly listed company,and it seems to me,because I have never evencome close to running one,that a mistake for apublicly listed companycan be severely damagingIn the short term.In the short term,but in the short termneeds to be dealt withbecause in long term, we all are dead.So it will be fixed.I don't have to sellmy stock next quarter.What difference does it makein the short term?So one thing is thatwhat if you make a mistake,which is the fear for most peopleat an individual level.If I make a mistake,then what will happen?What is usually the reactionin the Zomato culturewhen people make a mistake?I think we,we look to people to own it.If they accept it with humility,learn from it,it's totally coolNice.Actually, positive points for it.Correct.If they go defensive,and if they are trying tosay somebody did this and that,,then it's negative 10 points.We sort of lose trust in people that way.Got it.So mistakes are totally cool.We do it.Exactly.It's not okay to not learn from them.AbsolutelyAnd what if we all make a mistake?Tell us aboutone mistake that you feltthe company collectivelyended up making,and of course, not by design.And how did youactually recover from it?Because the culture allowed it to.I don't know the answer.I don't know the answer.Genuinely, I don't know.That's perfectly fine.But seethe trick is to identifythat this mistake was madeandthe earlier you actually recognize that,you are in a better place to fix it.So that's the whole thing.If you don't haveegos and if you want to learn,if you are constantly on thewatch out for good things,wanting to do great things,and then mistakes happenbut they are temporary in nature at most.And even the big ones can be fixed.There is nothing that cannot be fixed.Got it.Awesome.One last question.Who do you think is more forgiving,the market,the customersor your employees?The market.Okay, and why do you say so?See,for the market it's afinancial thing for the most part,right?I meanmost of the people whobuy our stock,they are also buying 99 other stocks.So it's a financial hedge for them.So it's good for them.Next year you dobetter, they will say,"Okay, now you guys are okay.Now I'll buy your stock."With customers and employees,you can permanently alterthe course of their lives.So, employees moreand customers a bit less,but in the business we are inwhere people rely on us forbirthdays, weddings, anniversaries,special moments in their life.We can really;when we screw up.We could screw up.Actually this bringsme to another question.If I may use the word,there are three core businessesZomato, Blinkit and Hyperpure.Where do you,if at all,where do you feel the most stress?And stress not in the sense ofbusiness stress.Emotional stress.If this thing is not going well,then people's lives might be shaking.Zomato.Blinkit is packed stuff.If I don't get a toothpaste,then my life will be ruined.Life will be wasted then.Zomato,because there is also restaurant foodand we don't have standardizationand process and hygiene.Things can go very wrong.And at scale, even avery small percentageof error rate could compound tothousands of such issues.We guys, I mean the team,every month, their goal is tobring the error rate down by 0.01%.0.01%Now, it is asymptoting as well.Of course, it will happen slowly0.01%And its compounding benefits are huge.AbsolutelyIf I improve that 0.01% and I look atthe size of the business5 years down the line,it will lead to 10% more thesize of the business.0.01% every day.WowSo imagine the number ofcustomers you savein a month multiplied by 30 is 0.3%Exactly, 0.3%.Now, multiply by 12.It's like 48,000.4-ish percent customers annually,you are saving.It actually compounds quite a bit.That's quite crazy.That's quite crazy.I asked you this question,but I would love to ask this againin front of everyone.Where doesDipinder see himself5, 10, 15 years from now?I have no idea, man.I don't have a plan.And are you okay with that?I am totally okay with that.Totally okay with life unfolding for you.I think we overthink a lot.We think we haveeverything under control.We have nothing under our control.We have zero control.Nature is a beautiful thing.I let nature take its course.It will take me wherever it wants.It's totally cool.Nature generally comesup with great things.It does.It certainly does.On that note,thank you so much, man.It was a pleasure.Please pick up Culture,not just because you are with Zomatoor have been with Zomatobut because you careabout building a culturethat will go beyond you,and you care about readingabout success storiesof businesses that havedone that wonderfully.Pleasure always.Thank you so much, man.Great30 minutes.How long was it?
