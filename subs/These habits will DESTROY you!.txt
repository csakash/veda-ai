Number 1:Ignoring your health.When you are in your 20s,it is very easy to ignore your health,because its effects are not visible.When we reach our 30s and 40s iswhen we realize the impact of the junkwe ate and drank,and our haphazard sleep scheduleon our bodyand on our mental and physical well-being.So a habit that you have to get rid ofin your life is,I will not ignore my body,I will not disrespect my body.Number 2:Getting distracted easily.Our world is full of distractions.The world's best scientists are workingon one thing only,the day you open Instagram Reels,how can they show you 30 Reelsinstead of just one?How can they keep you connected to itfor 30-60 minutes?And this becomes a habit.A habit that numbs your senses,and you really enjoy it.It's a peaceful life,where you don't have to thinkor do anything, and it's just going on.You may not even have to do thisin the future.You may just have to blink your eyesand the next Reel or Shorts will start,and you will be addicted.This habit can destroy your life.Not because it's social media,it's because you don't even realizethat you are getting numb.Don't allow yourself to get distracted.Schedule a time for distraction every day.I'll be distracted for an hour every day,I will waste as much time as I want,but within that hour.And it can be in 2 half an hours slotsor 4 slots of 15 minutes.And they will start and endat a fixed time,and that would be my principle.Number 3:Being a perfectionist.I have an interview questionwhich is my favorite.What is the worst thing about you?And the number one answer people give is,I am a perfectionist.I work,but doing it with perfection delays it,I take a lot of time,and people get really annoyed with me.But what can I do?That's how I am.No!Dude, perfection is a myth.It doesn't exist in real life.Perfection is just something thatyou will keep chasing forever and ever.What is more important isto chase accuracy.Accuracy means what you are doingshould be done properly.Not in the perfect manner,because the more properyou are in your work,the more you will improve on it,and the more it will move towardsbetterment.Get rid of this habit thatyou want to do everything with perfection.Instead,build a habit to do everything properly.Number 4:This really makes me angry.The habit of complaining.In India, this is our national sport,complaining.Hey! Look at Virat,this ball could go for a 6!What was he doing?Look at them, they are not doing anything.Look at them, they are blabbering.They can't do it!It's so hot!There are so many taxes!The food is cold!The food is not good!This is not working, that is not working!Look at the last 24 hours,and make a note of all the thingsthat you complained about.In the last 24 hours,you will be shocked athow many things you complained about!Stop complaining.When you complain,you essentially transfer controlto somebody else.You are telling yourself,I have done what I had to doand now it's the world's turn.Now I can't do anything about it,the world has to take care of it.And when you do that, you are powerless.If you get the habit ofcomplaining in life,it is such a bad habit thatyou will never be able to get rid of it.You will complain about everything,and for everything you will feelthat it's not in your control,othes have to do something about it.And you will then lose your entire controlover your own life.Number 5:The habit of being disorganized.Whenever we do something,we are totally disorganized.Our clothes are scattered,our room is chaotic,our table is messy,our work is all over the place,and that's why our thoughtsare disorganized.Our thoughts are not ableto get organized.It can see heaps of thingsthat it is not able to carvea clear path of thinking.And that will make you suffer.You will not be able to work properlyor live properly,and not take proper decisions.You will always be in two minds thatthere is a better way of doing things.You will never be able to decidewhere to start, when to start,and how to start.Procrastination will be an easy outcome.Please do not get into the habit ofbeing disorganized.Simple method.Start living life in an organized manner.Keep your table organized,your clothes organized,your work organized,your books organized,and your stationery and tools organized.The more you try to clearyour physical lifeand make it clutter-free,the more your mind will respondin the same manner.Number 6:The habit of not asking for feedback.You are scared of asking for feedback.Friends, this is a habit.A lot of people a very happyif they do work quietly,but never ask anyonehow they are doing.Whether they are doing goodor should they try something new?Are they doing anything wrong thatthey should try differently?They are scared,and gradually it becomes a habit.And the biggest consequence of this habitis the day you actually get feedback,you are devastated,your life becomes a chaos.You don't understand how to react,because we are not used to hearingsomething which is the truth.Please seek feedback.It is nobody's responsibilityto give you feedback,it is your responsibility to get feedback.And it is important for usto build this habit,we want feedback for every task.How am I doing?How can I do it better?Give me feedback.Number 7:Spending money but not for your learning.The worst habit!It's very easy to spend moneyto elevate your status.You will spend on clothes, good food,on cars, on phone, sneakers,vacations, on house,but you will not spend on your learning.You will not spend on books,on courses, on tutors,on guides, on training,because that seems to bea useless expense.Think about it!A book worth â¹300-400,as much as the cost ofa full large Domino's Pizza,a book which has somebody's wholelife experiences, learnings, mistakes,you can learn from that.But if you evaluate, you will be like,who reads books?A book for â¹300, it's so expensive!Let's eat a pizza.Or let's do something else.Let's take a Netflix subscription.And you are not used to investingin your own growth.If you build this habit early onin your life,then it'll be impossible to get out of it.Please start investing in yourself.Make it a habit.Number 8:Fear of change.You are scared of changes.Fear of change.This is a habit.We are scared of changes.Everybody feels that they arein a comfortable position.Everything is familiar,people are familiar,the situation is familiar,they know what they have to do,they know who they have to speak with,work is going well, life is going great,why bring the change?Have we lost it?Don't do it.Why be uncomfortable?No!Only those people progress in lifewho embrace changes,those who know that everythingwill eventually change.So if we start adoring changes,then we'll never be scared,we will never lose, we will never rust.And that has to be the motto of life.So the habit which scares you of a change,compels you to run away from it,just get rid of it.Number 9:It's in a few people, but it is there.Fear of technology.A habit where you just keep saying,I don't understand technology,I don't understand these tools,I am not going to do it.The fear of AI is even more.I can't use this tool,I don't want to use this tool.I don't want to understand Chat GPT,it's complicated.I don't want to understand blockchain,it's complicated.Dude, you will have to understand it.Not because it is important in your life,but because if you will be fearfulof any new technology,then you will be in a habitwhere you will not be able to stayin line with the world.You will be stagnant.Think about it this way.Our parents were born in a worldwhere there was no internet,other things are unimaginable.But now, they use WhatsApp as ifit was always around.Imagine if they had the fear of technologythat they are not going to use it.They say,I don't want to use UPI,I don't want to use WhatsApp,I don't want to use a phone.And there are parents like that,they are so far behind.They are far behindin their own generation.So many of their friends are livinga great life in a very different way,but they are still behind becausethey don't know how to embrace technology.Don't make this habit a realityof your life.Number 10:Oh my God!This habit is impulsive spending.You just startwherever you see any discount.You are not able to stop yourself.You log on to an app or a website,and start browsing,you have no plan to buy anything,but you end up buying.And now there is zero cost EMI,credit cards,there is one-third payment availableon credit cards as well,so you are just unstoppable.This habit can destroy families and lives,because so many people lose their lifebecause of debt thatthey are not able to get over it.And then they start makingshort-term decisionsand poor decisions about their money.Impulsive spending has to be taken awayfrom your life.Don't ever get into this habit.If you start forming this habit,just block your credit cards,delete your access,freeze your bank account,never give yourself a free handto buy anything whenever you want.Number 11:The habit of self-doubt.I won't be able to do it.I am incapable.I am not worthy.I am inadequate.I always lose in life.I can never be like them.People are way ahead of me.People will always win over.These stories that we keeptelling ourselves,they appease us.And that story is our choice.On one side,that story can be about self-doubt,I will never be able to.Or a story that I will try my best,whether I'm successful or not,but the effort will definitely be there,because I believe in myself.Not the belief that I will win,but the belief thatI will do everything I canto know that I have contributed my best.That self-doubt has to be killed.Because the world is anyway goingto doubt you.The world will 100% make you believethat you won't be able to do it.So if the world is already going to do it,then why are you hurting yourself,my friend?Get rid of this habit,and become positive about your own self.Write something every day,which tells you that you are good enough,which tells you thatyou understand yourself,which tells you thatyou are working on yourself.That will eliminate self-doubt.Number 12:Neglecting your network.This is a very bad habit in people.People think others are useless.I am an introvertand I don't network with people.Or, salespeople do networking.I am much beyond them.All are stupid reasons.Network is important because throughthese people only you will getyour next set of opportunities in life.These are the peoplewho will go to different companies,do different things in life,and they will meet more people,and through them,an opportunity cycle will be created,where they will remember youas a person who works passionately,who is nice to people,who respects people,never thinks bad about anybody.And that will make them rememberyou when they are looking for someone.Please network!Don't run away from people!Don't make that a habit.Number 15:Multitasking.This habit can ruin anybody.They work while they are on the phone,another video is playing alongside,music is playing,their mother is screaming,they are trying to cook as well,and they are placing an orderon Zomato or Swiggy too.You think that you area productivity pro max rockstar.It's wrong, my friend!Our mind doesn't work like this.Our mind works in a sequential order,not in a parallel order.So it finishes one task, then another,then another, and so on.And if you force it to doa lot of things at once,it doesn't break the process,instead what it does is do one thingfor a few seconds, then another,then third, then fourth,then comes back to one thing,then another, then third, then fourth,then comes back to one thing,and goes back and forth so fastthat you think you're doing allthe work simultaneously,but actually, your mind is getting tired.It doesn't even have any ideawhat is going on, it is on give-up mode.It is saying thatHe's stupid!He has told me to do these four things,I will do it, and just get rid of it!It is not going to be its attentive best,its focused best, its energetic best.Multitasking is an energy-depletingprocess in your life.Don't make it a habit.Number 16:The habit of saying yes.Ankur, can you please do this work?Absolutely sir!Ankur, can you get this?Absolutely!Ankur, I need help, can you help me?Absolutely!Ankur, my dogs are not well.Can you keep them at your homeas I have to go somewhere?Absolutely!Ankur, my t-shirt is torn,can you lend me one?Absolutely!Ankur, can you lend me some money?Absolutely!You always say yes.You have never said no.Why?Because you think aboutwhat people will say,what people will think about you.You have become such a people pleaserthat you don't even knowhow to say no to people.Saying no is an art,an essential life skill.Saying yes is a habit.And if you say yes to everything,then you will be forced to say noto those things which are importantfor you in your life.Learn to say no.And if you don't know how to say no,then a hack.Instead of saying no,ask for permission to say no.Tell people,I am busy, is it ok if I say no?Because it would be a heartless personwho would say,Of course, it is not ok to say no!Mostly they would say,It's okay, man.If you are asking so nicely,it should be okay.And that is how you get out ofthat situation.Build the habit of saying no.Get rid of the habit of saying yes.Number 17:Not having a routine,especially in your 20s.You feel likewho needs a routine?We can sleep, we can wake up,we can eat, we can drink,we can work whenever we want.We are young, we should enjoy ourselves,and that's how we should live.No!Having a routine doesn't meanyou should make your life boring.It also doesn't mean that you becomeso robotic that you are doingthe same thing every day in the same way.No!Routine means that in a fixed manner,you do the things you want to achieveevery day, every week, every month.And you have a way of proving to yourselfthat you can stick to your promise.Routine is a discipline.If you add free time to your routine,then that is also a part of your routine.For example, the routine of my first halfis free time, where I check my emails,browse on the internet, read something.I don't have a planned agenda,but even that is my routine.A routine where I don't have any agendais a routine, and that helps me.This habit of putting a routinein your day is paramount to your success.But if you build a habitwhere you have no idea aboutwhen your day is starting or endingor how it is being spent,then you will always be stuck in that.Number 18:Ignoring your sleep has become your habit.You have no idea when to sleepand when to wake up.You have become a slave to the alarm,and on the other hand to your friendsor TV or social media.So sleeping is determined by them,and getting up is determinedby the alarm clock,which you try to break by snoozing,and now this is the reality of your life.The best habit is that you will sleepand wake up at a fixed time every day.The time doesn't matter.It is not necessary that you haveto wake up early morning,or go to bed early every night,but it is important that you sleepand wake up at the same time every day,whatever that time is.Build this habit.Don't have a crazy sleeping schedule.That is the worst habit to inculcate.Number 19:Based on this, the habit of not being ableto track your time.If I ask you, how much Instagramor YouTube did you watch in the last week?You'll have an idea.But I can guarantee in writing thatthat estimate will be off byat least two or three orders.If you think that you have seen itfor only 3-4-10 hours in a week,then you must have seen itfor 10-20-30 hours in actuality,but you have no idea.You have no idea where your time is going.So when people ask me,we want to manage our time.I say,Management is far awayand it is also very easy,but to manage it, start tracking it.You should know where your timeis spent every day, why,and how it makes you feel.And if you do this,this habit will becomethe most important habit of your life.From the age of 13 to the age of 26,for 13 years,I recorded every single hour every day,and it helped me becomea time management ninja.That's why I am able toteach time managementbecause I know it is very easyand extremely important to manage time.You don't need any rockstar trainingor theory for this,all you need is clarity that I haveto track every single hour of mine.If I build this habitthen I'll realize where my time is spent,why, and how it makes me feel.And I will slowly start making changesto improve that.And finally, habit number 20:Always being ungrateful in life.Never being able to express gratitudefor anything,never being able to say thanks.We will say thanks to people,we will say thanks to the situation,but we can never say thanks to life.We never close our eyes to be thankfulthat we were born in this family,we got love, today I am even breathing,tomorrow I will be able to wake upor I feel that I will be able to wake up,today I am able to sleep,today I have a roof over my head,food to eat, clothes to wear,I have a job, siblings, parents,friends, self, body.So many things for whichwe should be thankful,but we don't do it.We say thank you,but are not able to be thankful in life.That is the mistake.Don't make being ungrateful a habitin your life.If you get rid of these 20 habitsin your life, then you will be saved.If any of these 20 habits stayin your life,then it will gradually shatter your life.The choice is yours.It's your life, your habits,your decision.It was my responsibilityto make you aware of these habits,and now it's your responsibilityto do something about it.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
