Whenever we talkabout investments,we mostly talk about money.Something that we wouldinvest, so that it grows.But here is an investmentthat I made,or in fact my familymade in me,that has paidsuch high returns,the first flight of my life.The first flight of my life,you won't believe,was for the US.Straight to the US.Not anywhere in between.The man travelled from Delhidirectly to Michigan.It was for my education.My PhD program.Fifty-five thousand rupeesfor a one-way ticket.And we had no money.Papa had to take out a loan,from his business associateto buy that one-way ticket.But that investment,changed my life.Because I figured something,that was so importantfor me in my life,that I did want to do,that one thingthat I was going for.I was destinedfor other things.And if it wasn'tfor that investment,it wouldn't have happened.
