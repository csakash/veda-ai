Check one, two.Okay, Aditya, this is your week'ssurprise video.Yeah, we have to give it a name.Let's call it 'The Lit Video'.The sick video, the lit video.Let's call it 'The Lit Video'.So, this is the week's lit video.I want this to be fast-paced.I want this to be like the NFT thingbecause in this I'll be covering a littleabout history and then I'll go tothe present and in the future.So take it for what it is.Alot of clips, like newspaper clippings,picked up from some other video.Because I'll talk about the dotcom crash.I'll talk aboutAsian Financial Crisis, so on.So make that happen. Okay, cool.Let's get started.There's no start.We'll go straight into it.In the year 2000, dotcom...Again.In the year 2000, dotcom got busted.I didn't used to invest at that time,So, I don't know what the actualimplication of that dotcom bust.Today, I invest.And I started to feelwhat might have happened at that time.For the first time in life,I am sitting on such a stockwhich is 80% down in its value.Eighty percent value andand this is not some penny stock.This is not some random stock.It's a very well recognized company,a great tech company,but now 80% down.And I want to talk to you about whatthat means, not just for now,but for the future.Because I feel thatthis moment that we are going through,particularly in global markets,is once in a lifetime opportunityto become smart about your money.Because, at this time,if you take that action,which a lot of people are afraid to take,you may emerge,far smarter, far wealthier than all of us.Look at this graph.This graph is Nasdaq composite index,which is predominantstock exchange index of the US.And in red arrows,I have marked all those times.Where this Nasdaq index got beaten up.Year 2000, dotcom bust,the market crashed by nearly 80%, 90%.2007, 2008 when financial crisis happenedthe whole downfall of the real-estate,in the US. Because of that,Lehman Brothers and so many companieswent bust.In 2016, there was a small bliplargely around SAAS techbecause of which there was a small impact.In 2019, before COVID,there was another pressure,because of everything that was happeningin the world.I don't know much about itthat's why I just gavea very random statement.In 2020, COVID happened,and the market went through a period ofuncertainty before going throughmassive gains.And now again,in 2022, there's a downfall.All of these periods,They have been very well documented.But, alot of you might not have investedyour money in these periods.So, you don't really know what happened.In fact, I just did a poll on YouTube.Aditya, go back to the community postI did a poll on that.In this poll, I asked people when didthey start actively investing?And...Actually, why don't Igo through the poll itself.I am talking so much...Okay, we have 21,000 votes,so we could show the poll now.Okay. Let's go to the poll. Okay.In fact, recently...oh sorry, I need to show this.Oh shit, I...Sorry, Aditya,I didn't start the Loom,so the graph that I was referring to,you couldn't have seen it.But I'm hoping you would get it.Okay, now I'm recording Loom.The graph that I was studying earlier,that is there in the graph folder.So, you could see it in that.In fact, I had recentlyasked you on the YouTube,when did you start actively investing?And you will see 32% of youhave started investing onlyin the last one year,Around 12% in the last two yearsor 45% haven't even started investing yet.I'm assuming that's because you're notearning, that's perfectly fine.But close to 50% of you,have been investing in the last two years.And what happened in the last two years?In the last two years,this period has come.This entire period of gainfrom 2020's crash of COVIDtill the end of 2021's peakis what you have witnessed.So, you guys don't have any ideawhat this downfall meansand this will affect you.It will disturb you,it will make you very nervous,very anxious.But it is important for youto recognize that why this periodcould be a periodof the biggest opportunity.So, let's try to knowwhat's happening in the market?In the US,tech stocks are taking a beating.The stocks of the most tech companiesare massively downhill, why?Lastly, three reasonsone, the war of russia-ukraine,because of that, the energy crisishas spread across the world.that is creating some ripple effect.Second, because of supply issues in China,a lot of tech industry's semiconductors,chips supply has been stopped.And then number three.And then number three,in the last two years,because of COVID,the US government has particularlyprinted a lot of dollars,because of whichthere's a massive liquidity.So, strangely what's happening,is that the world is going throughwhat is called Stagflation.Such a moment, where the growthis not that much becausethe supply is less,there are not many jobs,there is not much of an income,but because there's so much money,inflation is very high.The US has recorded its highest inflationin decades and that is creatingan economic condition.Where the growth is not muchbut the inflation is very high.The price of things are getting high,but your income is not growing that much.And that is a very troubling period.Especially, because the tech stocksthey are not yet profitable.Because inflation is rising,then the government, mostly,increases interest rate to counter that.And when the interest rate increases,then the value of money startsdepreciating over a period of time.So, the money of the future,it's value will be a lot less,as against the value of money today.Today's one dollar is tomorrow'sToday's one dollar won'tbe tomorrow's one dollarit will be a lot less.And the rate at which it is depreciating,or losing the value,is faster if the interest rates are more.All of these things are makingtech stocks take a beating.But, as I said,this could be a moment of opportunity.And for that you have to look at historybecause history always has lessonsfor all of us.To give you a sense, let me show you whatAmazon felt likein all these years of existence.The stock of Amazon, around 2000,The stock of Amazon, around year 2000,was worth $100,and then after that through a beatingand it lost 90% of its value.You can look at that graph and seethat how much its value had decreased.Imagine being an investor of Amazonyou've bought a share for $100,and today, it's being sold for $10.And it took what almostI'm just going on and on and onto see where it stopped.It took almost seven yearsto get back to that same number.But when it reached,because this was a timefor Amazon to make investments,for it to continue doingwhatever it had to doand it had to recovera lot, after that,it started risingand then there was no looking back.There was no looking back.Because at that point,no matter how muchyou go down, you'll always be upperthan your original price.So, all those who believedin the opportunity and continued to buystocks of Amazon during this periodof 2000 to 2007 are now millionaires.They made the best bet,the best investment of their lives.Now, we don't knowwhat that next Amazon is.We don't know if we should buythe stocks of Amazon now,so that, after seven years when theyget to that price.It will move faster and so on.We don't know whether we shoulddo it for some other stock.Let's look at some other stock.One of my favorite stocks, Google.Google, same around 2007,It was around $316 and thensubprime crisis happenedand it went down by 55% or so.55%, half value of the stock was lost.And this then that...And at this point, when it was at $142it...Sorry.And at this point, when it was at $142,it took almost three more yearsto come back to that original pricewhich was in 2007.But when that happened, after that,it was raining money.Investment upon investment,return upon return.So all those who were buying Google stockbetween 2007 and 2010are now billionaires.They don't have to ever earn again.That's what I think could bethe opportunity for all of usToday, I, where the whole world is afraidto invest in the US market.am regularly investingbecause I know that in the next two tothree years when this marketis going to go down,And it will take it's time to recover,if I am able to make the right investmentsI will make more moneyin the next ten years to followthan any other investmentthat I would make.This is just my belief and that'swhat I am doing right now.But, one thing is common between youand me, I don't know what stocks to buy.I am not an expert,I can't do that research,fundamental analysis,technical analysis that experts can do.So I always rely on indexesand indexes are very powerful here.Because they then optimizefor the good and the bad,and keep giving you consistent return.Yes, an index will give youless return than a particular stock.But, that is still betterbecause the risk-adjusted returnwould be great.I don't know which stock to pick,then I am taking a very big riskpicking up any stock.But, when I invest in an indexthat means a portfolio of stocks,then my risk is getting mitigated,while still giving mereasonably high returns.What could be an index for this?Personally, I've invested in two indexes.One QQQ and second VOO,QQQ is much interesting for me now,because it is atech heavy investment fund.QQQ is much interesting for me,because it is a techtech focused index.48% or so of its current investmentsare in standard tech companies.Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla,so on and so forth.That is what I want to buildbecause now all these stocksare going through a correctionand if I keep accumulating over the nexttwo to three years, I knowI would have gathered themat a brilliant price.So that the return for the next 10 years,it would be able to consistentlybeat any other stable return.This was QQQ. Details of QQQit is the Invesco QQQ trust...This is QQQ, it is listed on the Nasdaq.It is the Invesko QQQ Trust Series one.This is its return of five years.Which is 119% that means within five yearsyour money got doubled.And this is after the correctionthat has happened recently.Which is almost close to 22%,if you look at only peak of five years,then it was 188%,that means your money almostgrew three times.Then it went through a 22% correctionto bring it out to almost two times.But it's still a lot of timesin just five years.If you fully research on QQQ,then you will realise that theconstituents of it are mostlythe US tech stocks.I use INDmoney to make all mytech stock investmentsso if you...Okay, now,So, if you go to INDmoney,you shouldn't show this, Aditya.Current value invested, becauseI haven't invested through INDmoney,I did it directly.But, that's perfectly fine. Okay.If you look at INDmoney,it will give you allthe details about QQQ.If you would have put five lac rupees,for instance, then within three years,that five lac would have become 10 lacs,nine and a half lacs.If you would have invested this in SIP,which is the 500 top stocksof the US.So, that would have been eight lac rupees.If you would have invested this inNifty fifty,which is India's top 50 stockson the National Stock Exchange.Then it would have been around seven lacs.It will also tell youwhat are the constituents.So, if you look at the top ten holdings,so clearly, tech heavy.Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Metawhich is Facebook, Netflix,blah blah blah.And if you look at sectorthen you will see technology is48% which is what I reasonably want.The second big thing which has happenedand that is critical for this approachis a regular disciplinedinvestment approach.SIPs. SIPs are far better thanlump sums at this point,because you don't know thathow down will the market go.So you don't want to be timing the market.I would never recommend that becauseI can't do that personally.What you have to do is regularly keepinvesting in an SIP.INDmoney has recently launched SIP,you can see on the screen how it works.It's very, very simpleyou pass a mandateto your bank and every monthvery easily that money grows.it goes into the investmentsand everything is clean and clearat all points of time.Your investments through INDmoneyare absolutely freeYou don't have to pay any moneyto transfer money from India to the US,exchange rates are the best.Everything is safe and secure.All your investments are with a safeand trusted authority, not with INDmoney.All of these processes are auditedby a third party independent observer.So it is, at least my preferable wayof investing in the US stock marketswhich I would recommendto all of you as well.INDmoney...With this, a great giveaway,if you want to start your US stockinvesting journey through INDmoney,then using my link which is there inthe pinned comment and description below.You can get a stock of Google for free.How you have to do it?Just click on the link that is there inthe pinned comment and the description.When you makeyour first transaction with it,then you get Google stockabsolutely for free.This is just somethingthat is coming from meto you through courtesy INDmoney.Another index that I really likethat is WOO and Vanguard 500index fund, this is an ETF,which is equivalent of a mutual fundin the US.And what it does is it invests in the top500 companies of the USas against a selection of companiesthat QQQ does.So if you want some average out returnthen this will be a good one to go after.If you look at it,in the last five years, it has given 68%,so, lesser than QQQstill, pretty good because in five yearsif you got an absolute 68% of return.That is still not bad.This is after having gone through acrash which is almost15% in the last few months.If you look at this, this is again a greatfor you to start yourUS stock investing journey.US stock investing journey's third anda great part is thatyou also benefit from the exchange ratebetween the US dollarand the Indian rupee.Unfortunately and I'll say unfortunately,because as an Indian,I wouldn't want that but rupee appreciate,But, the rupee depreciates in valueover time as compared to the US dollar.Means if you, today,want to invest one lac rupees,and you convert it into the US dollar,then it will be converted around 76, 77.If you have done the same thing10 years ago,those one lakh would have been convertedat the rate of 50 or 55.Dollar would have increased, right?So, the number of dollarswould have gotten would increase.And on dollar this is the growth rate.Which is 68% for WOO,116% or 118% for QQQ,and when you convert that money backin the Indian rupees,during that period of timewhich could be five years.Ten years whatever it is.The rupee would have depreciated morethen your dollar will earn more rupees.So you will not just gain fromthe capital depreciationof the stocksyou have the US stock market,you also gain from thedepreciation of the Indian rupee.Not something that I would wishbut because this is a reality,I would at least want us assmart investors to benefit from it.Ultimately.Remember this that the best use ofyour Indian rupeesis to invest in the Indian stock marketwhich will continue to be the highest,hopefully the highest or one of thefastest growing countries in the worldfor the next 10, 20 years.And the US stock market,which will continue to decisivelybe the biggest stock market in the world.Where the top companies reside.When you have the power of these two.you actually are creatingone of the strongest portfoliosthat you can for the next 10, 20 years.This isn't a short term approach.This isn't a way to earn money overnight.This is the way that you makeabsolutely smart dollarsusing the benefit of historythat I just showed youand the understanding of the presentto make sure that you havea kickass future.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
