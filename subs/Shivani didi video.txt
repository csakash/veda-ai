Thank you so much for joining us.It feels good to call you on this channel,thank you for making time.Thank you, Om Shanti!Didi, I want to ask you five questionsmy audience often asks me.My audience is in their 20s,so they are going througha confusing phase because of whatthey learned in school and college,now they are realizingwhether it's applicable or not to life,now they have to live life witha different perspectiveand learn on their own,so these 5 questions are often asked to mewhich I would like to ask you,and take your opinion.Didi, the first question is,in our 20s,we are looking at the whole world,we are looking at our friends,we're looking at other people,we look at millions of peopleon social media, and invariably,comparison becomes a way of life.They have more money,they seem to be happier,they have these relationships,they have this and that,and it becomes really hard to figure outwhat mistake have we made,that we seem to be lacking something,and so on.So one question that I often get asked ishow do we stay true to ourselvesand stop comparing ourselves to others?Comparison was probably learnedfrom childhood,because our parents also compared uswith someone or the other.When in school we used to get our marksor we came back after our test or exam,the first question used to be,how was your paper?So we used to tell ours.The next question was,how about everyone else?How much did others score?And now that we reflect back,we feel it's a very irrelevant question,because how was my exam should bein reference to how was my preparation.If I prepared so well,then was my exam betterthan that preparation,or less good than my ability,then the focus should beon my preparation, my circumstances,my situation, and my performance.But from time immemorial,we had considered comparison as natural,so our parents also compared uswith others,sometimes compared us withour brothers and sisters,sometimes compared us with our neighbors,and sometimes compared uswith our friends' children.So whether we are comparedin our performance,whether we are comparedin our physical appearance,and whether we are comparedfor our values,especially among siblings,that comparison is drawn every day.But the intention was very good,that we need to remember,we will not say that the parentswere doing something wrong,only the method needs to be changed a bit.The intention was very good,the intention was to motivate,the intention was to transform.So they used to say,Look, your brother speaks so wellin front of everyone,you are so silent,you are so scared.So the intention was to motivateand transform us,but the method was of comparison,so it slowly became our conditioning,that I am good has to bein reference to other people.So two things happened,one is comparison,and the other is public approval.If people will say that we are good,only then we are good.This also started in childhood,when guests used to come home,then our parents used to say,narrate that thing of yours,show that painting of yours.Again, the intention was very good,that my child has done something good,let them show it to everybody,get blessings,but when they used to see us narrating,dancing, or singing,the guest did not say thatyou performed very wellor you painted very well, they said,you are a very good child,you are a very good boyor you are a very good girl.This became a deep conditioningthat my performance is equal to mebeing a good person.It is very subtle but this becamethe coding of our life thatI am good if I perform well.So it was not about who I am as a person.What are my values?What is my personality?What do I think?How caring, kind, humble,and sharing am I?Nobody spoke much about these things,only my performance was talked about.So two things were coded since childhood,and they are, one is performanceis more important than who I am,and the second is performanceis also good or badin reference to others.So even if I am the bestaccording to my capacity,but if someone is better than me,then I am not the best.So these two things were coded deeply.And this brought in two values in us.One is comparison,and then automatically comesin competition with othersand with our siblings,when we grow up we competewith our spouses,then comes in jealousy.So many values connect with one value.And the second one which is very deepand damaging is public approval,that people should tell me that I am good.And since the advent of social media,both these values have gone toa different level,because earlier I wanted approvalfrom people around me,now I want approval from strangers,and then every day when we are seeingour number of likes and comments,just so that I can get more likes,we are trying to change myselfto get more likes,which means we try to be more likethe things people approve of.In today's time, it is not necessarythat what most people are approvingis right for me, it's not necessary.We are not passing through the timewhere the majority is walkingon the right path or thinking right,because the majorityis not thinking at all.They are doingwhat the other majority is doing.Many people are not using their opinionor standing for the right,they do the same as others are doing,what everyone is doing,so we are also doing the same.So the majority is moving toa different energy and vibration,and we are trying to be like themto get their public approval.And what happens is thatwe don't remain what we are,we try to be like thembut even that doesn't happen,and that's why our personalityis confusing.Actually, there is no confusion,but we are creating confusion,and that's because our attentionis mostly on others,and we pay so much attention to othersthat we do not pay attention to ourselves,we do not think about ourselves.Which of my values are correct?What do I have to change?If you want to make a comparison,then do it in terms of values,how compassionate the other is,I too can learn that,I too can do that,how humble the other is, how kind,I can also become that,the other person has a sense of service,I can also do that,so even if there is a comparison,then it will not be called comparison,it will be called inspiration thatif we see those values in someone,we should also learn,we should also elevate our values.But to compare that someone has more,so I also must have,it is a never-ending race.First of all, it will never end,and that's why we willnever be happy in life,because we will always feel thatI have less than someone else.It is bound to be less than someone.Many years back we were doinga corporate program,they said we have a lot of stress,so we asked themwhat is the reason for stress?So they said that we are number onein the country in our field,whatever their industry was,and we have to remain number one,so we have that stress.Now we are living in that era wherethe children who come firstalso have stress.Then we asked them what is your targetfor the next year?So they said X.So I said suppose you achieve2X next year, would you be happy?They said, of course,we will be very happy,because we decided the target as X,and we achieved 2X.And then I said,but you will not be number onebecause someone else will probablyachieve more than 2X,so would you be happy?They didn't know what to answer,they were looking at each other like,will we be happy?They achieved 2X instead of X but still,they are not happy becausesomeone else achieved more.We cannot go lower than this,it is going very low in our values,that we have problemswith the happiness of others,we have problemswith the progress of others.We are that culture that blessesthe success of others,and rejoices in the success of others.Even if you are not happy,don't be upset that others gotmore than you.Even if you achieve more than others,it won't be worth it becauseyou have lowered your values.That's why the most important thingis to elevate your values, your dignity,your thought process,make that number one.And when you elevate your thoughts,values, behavior, and vibrations,then you will go far above your capacityin what you are doing,not in comparison to anyone else,but in comparison to your own capacityand potential.And at this time many peopleare going down in their thinking.So really less competitionis going on there,so go for it, and you will go higherthan your ability.Very beautiful!I loved everything that you said!The most thought-provoking was thatif you have to compete,then compete against your values,get inspired by peoplewho have a higher moral ground than you,because then that is what you canaspire towards.Very beautiful!Didi, thank you so much for this!The second question and this issomething that comes everyday,and I don't blame this generationbecause they are going througha very different experience,where there is social media,so many things that are happeningconstantly in their lives,which was definitely not thereto this level when I was growing up,and this is about focus and distraction.Every single second something is shoutingand asking them to pay attention to it,whether it is social media,whether it is content,whether it is people,whether it is news,whether it is anything that's happening.So in my time, the range was very small,so the noise was also very less,and it was at a very limited level,now the whole world is making noise.Someone is saying look at my clothes,someone is saying listen to my songs,someone is saying look at this or that,and people are struggling to spendeven 5 minutes on somethingwithout breaking their attention,how do we get this focus in our lives?The most important thing isnot to blame the world.The world is making noise,the world is seeking attention,the world wants us to look at them,and there is nothing wrong.What they are doing is rightaccording to their perspective.We have to decide where to look or not,what to listen to or not,what to read or not.They can only make noise around me,they cannot pull my mind and karma senses,that's completely my choice,under my control.Like if you go somewhere to eat food,then there are many things lying there.Like if you go to a restaurant's buffet,50 things will be lying there,but they can only keep 50 thingson the table in front of you,they cannot put them inside you.It is always our choicewhether we want to eat this or that,how much to eat, when to eat,and what to eat, that's my choice.So the first step is not to pointthe blame finger out thatthere is so many distractions outside,there are so many options outside.There are many options these days.Today if we are on this platformthat is also because somebody choseto come out into the worldand bring something,so this is an option,and that's how there aremany other options,all I have to do is choosewhat I want to eat.On that table, there would be junk food,unhealthy food, healthy food,and very healthy food as well,it is my choice.I just have to take care of myselfthat I go towards healthy foodinstead of taste.My inclination will go towards tasty foodbecause it is tasty,but when I come to know thatit is not healthy for me,then it depends on my willpower.I cannot tell the other person,why did you make such thingsand put them on the table?They would say,I have kept everything,it's your choice what you want to eat.So first thing is, never blame.Blame reduces our strength.Never blame anyone and anythingfor anything.Never say, this is because of that,that is because of this.As soon as we blame anyone for anything,we have given our power to them.It is always me!It is my choice,what to think is also my choice,what to decide is also my choice,what to say is my choice,what to do is my choice,the world does not control me,I am the master of myself.It is a different matter thatwe live like a victim.The world is like this,the world cannot do anything,the world is doingwhat it thinks is right,and we will do what we feel is right.The most important thing is to rememberthat we become what we hear,read, and see,this is 120% certain!We become what we hear, see and read.So content and informationare emotional diet,it forms my values becauseit forms my thoughts,my values become my actions,and my actions become my destiny.So what we keep on doing withthe phone like this,or with the TV remote like that,or with the mouse like that,and absorb many things,we consider it as time pass,it is not time pass,they become our values,our values become our actions,and our actions become our destiny.So make a poster in your room,put it on the desktop of yourphone or laptop,content is equal to personalityis equal to destiny.Now make your choice,what you choose is up to you,but tomorrow when something will happen,don't say it's because of that,say that I chose it.So choose carefully,because at this time we are goingthrough such a periodwhere mental health issuesare increasing very fast,and to prevent mental health issues,we have to take care of emotional health,and to pay attention to emotional health,one has to pay attentionto the emotional diet.So always remember,it is someone's business,whatever content we are consumingis someone's business,they are earning a lot of moneybut we are losing our fortune.So we just need to pay attention,once that thing fits here,then nothing can distract mebecause I am creating my destiny.And when we consume too much content,we think too much,and that's why overthinkingis another big problem,my mind doesn't stop thinking,and keeps on thinking,fear is created, anxiety is created,tension is created, aggression is created.Why is it getting created?Because you are consumingthat kind of content.Don't consume that contentfor just 15 days,more than half of your uncomfortablevalues will end automatically,you won't have to do anything.So that's why like you saidwhen we were in school and college,this content was not there.We have grown up with the first TV coming,the first phone, first everything.But then along with it,you see that we did not knowthe word depression.Means when I was in school or college,we didn't even know the word stress,that stress was only in physics,pressure divided by resilience.We never said,I am stressed.I had not heard that wordat that time in emotions.We only used to say a little tension1 day before the examand 1 day before the result, that's all,but it is only because of the content,at that time, there was no stress,no depression,not even as many divorces in relationshipsas today,neither cancer nor diabetes was likeit is happening today,because all these things start from here,and there is an effect of content on it.So it is even more importantin student life,because that time is for your studies,that time is for setting the foundationof your career.Don't let someone else's businessspoil your luck,the choice is yours.Beautiful! Loved that!Mental health is a direct consequenceof your emotional healthis a direct consequenceof your emotional dietand your emotional dietis determined by the content you consume.Beautiful! Very nice! I love this!Keeping the time in mind, didi,we will ask one more question at the end,and this is quite similar tocomparison and focus,but with a slightly different structure,and that is about the abundance of choicebecause nowadays we can do anything.In our era, if we became doctors,engineers, lawyers,then life was set in a way.Now we can become anything, go anywhere,study anything,and that has ironically led tomore confusion than clarity.There is an abundance of choiceand people are absolutely confusedabout that abundance of choice,as to how should they think abouttheir life which is comprisingtheir professional career,but also then a reflection ofwhether they should chase their ambition,or fulfillment, or a combination,or divide their life into different phaseswhere they can be very aggressivein their 20s and hustle,then look after the family in their 30s,then look after self in their 40s,but then that looks likea very long drawn process of living life,so there is a lot of miscalculationaround how to live lifebecause of the abundance of choices.So someone in their 20swho is making very strong decisionsabout their career,about what they going to doin the future and how,what would be your adviceor recommendation onhow they should go aboutmaking those choices?Most important is who is goingto make the choice?It's I!So the one who is going tomake the choice,am I energizing that I on a daily basis,because if that I is not energized,then it may not make the right choice,and if it doesn't make the right choiceand decision,and if that decision is takenunder peer pressureor according to what the majorityis doing mostly,then whatever choice we make,sometimes it is easyand sometimes there are difficulties,and when those difficulties come,I won't have the strength to face them,because I did not energize I,so that word 'I' always needsto be underlined.Who is I?I is not a relationship,I is not a role,I is not a position,I is the I which plays everything.So this is like the seed of life.It is a seed, and the tree of lifecomes out of this seed.So this seed influencesthe health of the body,this seed forms relationships,we work because of this seed,and there will be a lot of fruitsand flowers on it,but how is the health of the seed?If the seed is healthy,then only the tree will be healthy,then only the fruits and flowerswill have good fragrance, colors,and taste.But what if the seed is not taken care of?So one is to pay attention to the seed.Secondly, we are hustling professionally,but during that also we are not nourishingthe seed on a daily basis.You have to water the seeds and rootsonly for 5 minutes.We say we don't have time for thator we're not interested in that,we'll work on the whole tree,we'll wash each leaf,we'll wash each fruit and flower,but we don't have time to waterthe seeds and roots.This means we don't want to energizethe self,we want everything outside to be perfect,and thus is the result.Whatever we are seeing todayis the result of this,instead of nourishing the roots and seed,we are working hard on the whole tree,then life becomes a struggle.It takes a lot of hard work,and you have done well,but still, there is no contentment,no happiness,what is the exact benefitof such an achievement?Have you ever asked yourself,what is the benefit ofsuch an achievement?I mean, they are in their 20s,that's why I would like to sharewith them.When we meet those who arein their 50s, 60s, or even 70s,and people who have achieved everything,whatever they thought and desired,they have achieved much more than that,there is nothing that they don't have,but they still ask, how to be happy?How to be contended?So don't you think that first of allyou should decide how to be happy?If you do anything while being happy,it feels good.But today we have opposedour conditioning.We said when I do this, I will be happy,when I become this, I will be happy,and then for some days, they do it,saying they are bored now,what else should we do to be happy,because we are living our lifeby the opposite equation.We felt,from the doing the being will be happy.The equation is not,from the doing the being will be happy.If the being is happy,whatever I do I will enjoy it,if the being is okay.This means you have to nourishthe being on a daily basis.Every day if you spend some timewith yourself,if you don't start your day withyour phone, TV, and things like that,but with yourself,give some time to reflection,meditation,do even 10 minutes of spiritual study,even that is content,spirituality is content,but that content has faith, acceptance,compassion, happiness,if you consume it every day,you will become like that,because we only have to takethe emotional diet,we automatically become like that.If you give yourselfeven 15-20 minutes every day,consume divine and pure contentin the morning,your mind will strengthen,sit with yourself for 5-10 minutes,build a lovely relationship with yourself,that is meditation.Then whenever you have to take a decision,you just have to sit with yourself,because no one knows betterthan you what is right for you,because the choice you will makeis going to take you to your values,your actions, and your destiny.So intuition is the best wayto take a decision,logic is not always the best wayto take a decision.Because logically what seems right today,it will change after 2 years,then we will say,we had thought like this,then it happened like this,because we are taking a logical decision.Study everything logically,but the decision should be intuitive.It comes intuitively,it'll come like thisand this needs to be done,logic will say, no, it is not to be done,wisdom will say, it has to be done,this is what we call the inner voice,intuition.Intuition means a tutor sitting insidewho gives you tuition classes.It's sitting, it's giving,listen to its voice.We keep asking everyone,we go online and search everything,but we don't listen to the onewho is sitting inside and giving.So 10-15 minutes daily with the self,not just when you have tochoose your career,it is for life,because we have to take very importantdecisions every day,and most importantly,when you give this time to yourself,then the seed of life which we callthe soul or I will get strengthened.No matter how good choices you make,no matter how right decisions you make,a scene comes and life suddenly changes.We have seen this in Covid,be it professionally,be it in relationships,be it with life,in one second all the decisions,all the right choices,everything that we had done,changed in 1 second.Then everything that is going perfectlysuddenly changes,but everything should be fine here.This outer world is not consistent.It is not a world of certainty anymore,we are going through uncertain times,and it will remain uncertain.But when the outer world is uncertain,at least the inner world should becertain, guaranteed, sorted.When that seed will be strong,it will be able to face any situationin life with absolute stability.If something was decided,but something else happens,then it will mold itselfand adapt very quickly.It won't say,I don't want to live anymore,just because I didn't becomewhat I thought I will,or the relationship I built,they rejected me,I don't want to live anymore.We get so many emails now,and these children say,I don't want to live anymore!Is this line a joke?But since we don't have the ability,and even if a small thing doesn't suit us,then we say,I don't want to live anymore.So it is most important to strengthenthat seed.New choices will come everyday,today you will decide one thing,tomorrow something else will come,you will become something else.I did engineering 25 years ago,today I am here, I didn't know it,I didn't choose it, life went on its own,but it is necessary thatwhat we are doing,our happiness does not depend on it,we should be happy doing it.We are doing it out of happiness,not doing it for the sake of happiness,because happiness will not comeby doing anything, happiness comesonly by nourishing the seed daily.Then taking choices and taking decisionsbecomes very easy, very simple.Just spend time with yourself daily.Beautiful!I think this is the best advicewe all can get.And it is a very simplebut a very difficult advice,so if you can start,there is no better day to startthan today.And just spend 10-15 minuteswith yourself,it will seem weird, it will hard,but the more you do it, as didi said,the more you will strengthen that seedand the roots for yourself.This is wonderful, didi!Thank you so much for being alwaysso eloquent, so clear,so thoughtful and so inspiring.I don't need to say this,your content has made the livesof so many people so much better,and I hope you that continue to dowhat you are doing.Thank you for spending time with us.Nice to be with you,I got to learn so much thatI'll always be indebted!Thank you so much!Thank you, Om Shanti, thank you!
