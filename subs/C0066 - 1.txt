Ok, we are back shooting itOkNow these â¹69-70 lakhs,will work for you ahead in life.This means the â¹1,50,000 that youneed every month at the age of 30which is your retirement age,will be generated by these â¹70 lakhs.How will it be generated?The way you have invested your moneytill now and got a return of 15% on it,similarly, you will have to investthis money also and whatever returnyou will get, the differencenow will be that you will not reinvestthat return, at the end of the year,or the month, or wheneveryou would need money, you would sellonly that much, and the restwill continue to be invested.How will it work?Let's do the math.So you have to earn â¹1,50,000from these â¹70 lakhs, which meanson a monthly basis you have to geta return of 2.2%, which ona yearly basis means 26%.Now to get a 26% return consistentlyfor the rest of your life isimpossible.That cannot happen!This simply tells you the sad answerthat by this math, even if you startat the age of 20, you cannotretire by the age of 30.That is the reality!At the end of this investing cycle,if you want to earn morethan 15% consistently, that means itwill be extremely hard to do that.There are three reasons, why.Number 1, you are retiringat the age of 30, and of course,you will be alive till 70-75 years of age,so there is no asset thathas generated a return of 15%for 50 years consistently.There is no asset that has done thatover such a long period of time,except for equities,which hovers around 15-20%.Number 2, to all those assetswhich even generate such a higher return,are very volatile, which means,fluctuate a lot, and now sinceyou are whole life depends on this return,you would want predictability in it,you can't have it go up and downsignificantly, because if one daythe market goes down by 20%,and you need a return of 15% or 26%in this case, you didn't get that,instead you lost 20% of your money.So would you stop living for that year?!No, right?Because these are your needsand your wants.It can't happen like that.So, the more return you expect,the more volatility it will bring along,which means, you will have tofocus on the least return possible.That is the way that it will work.So let me show you how witha simple tweak you can get there.You say you want to retire bythe age of 30, let's make ita little realistic,let's make it 35 years.Now suddenly, if at the age of 20,you plan to retire at the age of 35,and you will have exactly thesame numbers, nothing has changed,then you will have â¹3,64,00,000in your account at the age of 35,which after inflation-adjustedwill be â¹2,00,00,063.Now if you have to earn onlyâ¹1,50,000 from this, actually nowlet's increase this â¹1,50,000 also,let's say at the age of 35you would need â¹2 lakhs, perfect.Now, how much return do you need?Only 9% annually.Only 9%!Can you imagine now, the big difference?!We have come down from 26% to only 9%,even with a higher expense per monthof â¹2 lakhs, only becauseyou planned for longer.This is what it is!Suppose you are 25 years of age,and you want to retire at the age of 40,exactly the same math works here my friend,exactly the same math!Can you imagine how easy it actuallyis to plan for something like this?!But we are still not able to do itbecause we do not invest inthis disciplined fashion.Let's look at the yearly view.So this is the yearly view,lemme just go back to 20 and 35, ok?Let's look at the yearly view,this is the yearly view.I will zoom in, alrightSo this is the age,these are the monthly expenses,which we assume to be â¹2 lakhs.Our starting corpus, which means,the money with us afterinflation adjustment atthe age of retirement.How much return did we generate?Because we need the moneyaccording to our expense.How much are our expensesbecause we will generate the returnas per our expenses?And if there is anyadditional withdrawal or not.When you look at this math,you will see, since your expensesare increasing every year,at some point this numberbecomes negative, which is thecorpus left, which is at the age of 84.This means, if you workaccording to this plan,then at the age of 84, you willhave no money, everything wouldbe gone and you would haveno money left for you to bear.So now if we change this,and we want that flexibilitybecause in life, anything can happen.Let's say, at the age of 40we need â¹40 lakhs forour child's education.And then, at the age of 50,we need â¹50 lakhs more for something else.I am not assuming for what.Then you will see, wow!Not wow actually, oh shit!All the money is gone at the age of 57.This means, you cannot do all thiswith this investment,so you have to now increase that amount.So you can say that now I amincreasing this â¹1 lakh to â¹2 lakhs,this is difficult actually,so I will increase this 10% to 15%,which means, I will grow thisby 15% every year and not 10%.This means, â¹10,000 per monthin the first year,â¹11,500 in the second year, and so on.Now if you look at that, wow!You now have extended it to 70 years.You now have extended it to 70 years,which is awesome.If you go backand make this â¹15,000,then you will see, suddenlyyou have extended it to 89 years.This is how the entire magic is taking place.You can basically play with numbersand plan your whole life,even if you have such high withdrawals,which is â¹40 lakhs or â¹50 lakhsat that point, you can still haveenough and more money come through.This is how it simply works!Everything eventually comes downto your financial goals, how muchamount do you need in your lifeat what point for yourself,and it comes with the disciplineof investing money every single month.If nothing, I hope you have seenthat even if you start at the age of 25,you can retire at the age of 40in a very healthy manner,if you invest only â¹1 lakhat the beginning, and keep investingâ¹15,000 every month, and increaseit by 15% every year, with a returngenerated of 15%, which over 15 yearsshould be very very easy to do.If you are able to do that,at the end of 40 years,you will have â¹8 crores,and inflation-adjusted it will be â¹6 crores,and if you grow this by just 4% every year,you will never need any more moneyin your life for anything else.You have successfully retiredbecause of financial freedom.I hope this was useful.I have pinned the Excel sheetin the comments. If you have anyquestions about this,please do not forget to ask me.I wish you happy goal planning,I wish you happy investing,I genuinely wish that you retirebefore the age of 40, and chase your timeinstead of money, because frankly,that is the only thing that isthe most valuable in the world.Everything else can come back, but not timeOn that note, Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
