Check 1 2 check 1 2RollingAnd actionIf you create contenton social media then it's obviousthat you cannot please everybody.There would be a lot of peoplewho do not agree with your content.There would be a lot of peoplewho just don't like your face.There would be a lot of peoplewho don't like lookingor listening to you.And that will generatea fair bit of hate,a fair bit of trolling.But to balance that out...But that gets balanced somehow.The reason that I have not spokenabout all of this ever,was because there area lot of people who ona daily basis write suchbeautiful emails and messages,on how the content is helping them,that if I ever feel thatwhy do some people hate me,I go back to that folderand just convince myselfthat I am on the right path.But today, in a very differentform of a video,I want to share all thosecomments and trolls with you,which I have received inthe last 2-3 years,and just my reactions to them,because I find themgenuinely funny and amusing,and not at all hateful,because now I thankfully,have a level of maturityand calmness in life,maybe because of my age,maybe because of my experience,but whatever is it,these are mean tweets about Warikoo.The first one was a tweeton 23rd February 2019.This was around the timewhen I had quite decidedabout living Nearbuy.Eventually, I think I leftNearbuy in October 2019.But there was some news of methinking of leaving and so on,so somebody tweeted,'Nearbuy is shutting down,Warikoo has made his money,and has fired all his top management,and salary is pendingfor junior staff.'None of which is true.I wish I made money from Nearbuy,but I never made any moneyfrom Nearbuy, not as yet.I didn't fire any of mysenior staff or anything whatsoever.All of them stayed where they were.I stepped down as the CEO,so if anything,I fired my own self in October 2019,and then started thisentire content creation journey.Based on this, a reply onthis tweet was,'Warikoo made more moneyby conducting guest lectures,and wisdom talks in every wedding,mundan, and bhajan,Nearbuy was a side business.'I don't even...Naturally, you will afterreading this, because yes,I was giving talks,I was spending a fair bit of timein dealing with corporates,in startups, in college events,and so on, but there was justso much love that I had for Nearbuy,but the best thing thatI have done was set up a teamwhere Nearbuy did not need meas much as I needed Nearbuy.A recent tweet that came in,'BC Ankur Warikoo, giving awaygifts in his timeline.What is this scam?I read someone's receiveda mixer from him. WTF!'I do give a lot of gifts away.It has no basis, no objective.There are a lot of peoplewho think that I do giveawayson Twitter to get followers,but I never encourageor ask anyone to follow me.I don't even check whetherthey have followed me or not.We keep doing giveaways on YouTube,and there are so many of themthat are given out.The biggest and the mostprecious giveawaythat I have given isall the affiliate incomethat I get in a year.100% of it goes towardsthe sponsorship of kidsfor their higher education.So yes, I have given mixers,I have actually given awaysome very frivolous things,but there is joy in giving them,and that's why I have done that.I will not change it.One email that I got recently,Dude Ankur, how can I help you?This is all that you replyto people.Instead of giving wisdomon social media,be courageousand solve some real problems.Nearbuy was a flop, my friend.This is not a hate mail,this is a wake-up callfor all the modern Gyani Baba Jislike you!'I don't know what to say,because the truth is,it's actually one ofmy favorite questions to ask,how can I help you?Because it is crazyhow many people do not knowwhere they need help.So many people write in saying,Can you help me?And I ask them again,Where is it specificallythat I can help you?And it is ridiculoushow many people do not knowthe answer to that question.It was a little philosophicalbut you get the point.This is one of my favorites.If there is a notificationthen you can switch off the net.No, that's ok.'I find it incredibly fascinatingand hilarious that Ankur Warikoohas probably (definitely)made more money talkingabout startup than actuallyrunning a startup.'It is true to an extent.This is actually not a troll,it is true in life.I didn't make any money from...I didn't make any money fromrunning a startup.All my wealth is still attachedto Nearbuy's equity.I didn't make money.I have now finally begunto make money in my life,and that is through my courses,one of which is about startups,and that is genuinelythe most fulfilling activitythat I can do, because I believethat all the mistakesthat I made in the last 12 yearswhile running startups,if I can make peopleaware of all those mistakes,and through that help them notmake the same mistakes,I'll consider myselfand my experience very worthy.There are a lot of peoplewho are sick and tired ofwatching my ads, but some of themare so fed up, that theyare reacting this way.'Your growth can screw itself!'And to all of them, I can say is,while I'm sorry you seeso many of my ads,I wish I could control them.I kid you not, I don't havea way to control it,because I can't managehow many people get to seehow many ads and how many times.I can do it at a campaign levelbut not at an account level.But even if that is the case,I don't think there is anything,anything,that has gone so wrong in your lifeto be abusing someone for doing this.I would never do that.I would not want anyone of youto feel that same way,whether they are my adsor some other brand's ads.Maybe that platform is freefor you only because of those ads.I am not trying to explain what I do.I am trying, hopefully,for you to see how the change ofperspective can perhaps help you.Let's go next.'Warikoo's content is goodand definitely helpful,but it somehow comes acrossas very plastic and fake,maybe that's the reason he gets hate.I am not sure if his talkingstyle off-camera is similarto his real-life.'That's the best part about me.You meet me in a mall,see me on a YouTube video,you meet me anywhere in real life,I am exactly the same person.I do not have to put up any facade,and that's the best thing about mebecause I am living my own selfon a daily basis.'I agree professor Warikoocomes across as someonewho is a two-faced and fake person.'I wish you knew me,but that's perfectly fine.I don't expect you to know me,and I nearly don't expect youto have the right opinion about mebecause you don't know me.But the thing is I am exactlythe way I am.This was another one thatI've come across.'How to ban Ankur warikoofrom the internet?'I am so glad you don'town the internetbecause you can't ban me,I can't ban you either,so you are free to thinkwhat you want to think,I am free to create the contentthat I create,we both live happily ever after.I am sorry dude,sorry for breaking your heart.Ok.'Hey Warikoo, I am totallyfed up with you and thisYouTube showing me thesegay look-alike ads again and again.I am wasting my time bywriting you this email.'Thank you for writing it nonetheless.'No issues, but at leastdon't say to me thatI am wasting my time,that too repeatedly every day.'This is a reference tomy time management ads.'Seriously man!What do you know about me?!Just focus on your ad again,its content! I am workingmore than 18 hours a day.'I appreciate that you havea hard life.I respect the fact thatthe ad may not work for you.I am sorry I couldn't plan itany better.Again, thanks for sendingthat feedback.Thanks for taking out timeto share that email.I wish you hadn't said itthrough an anonymous number,because then I would haveat least had a chance to reply.'Guess what! He has alreadylaunched a paid course to createa successful YouTube channel.'Which is by the way wrong,but nonetheless.Nowadays he is busy promotinghis soon-to-be-launched book,I'm sure even this book will bea reverberation of the craphe talks about.This guy seriously needsto stop for the greater good,because all that he does isread and refer to goodand popular books,and rehashes the same contentin his own words,fooling people into thinkingthat he is a great life-changing guy.'I wish I thought about myselfthe way you think about me.I don't think I ama life-changing guy.I genuinely feel so blessedthat I am just doing whatI would normally do in my normal life,which is, speak about my experiences,hope somebody is listening,hope somebody can learn from it,and I now have a followingwhere people appreciatewhatever is it that I am sharing,but I don't take myself seriously man!I really do not take myself seriously.My team will testify for thatbecause I am making fun of myself,I am constantly sayingthat this is such a positionof privilege and gratitude,where there are so many peoplewho are listening to us,there are so many peoplewho spend their valuable timeon our content, it is justa privilege and a sense of gratitudethat I feel, nothing else.I do have a book.It did come out.It did do well, and I am just gladthat people received it that way,but I don't know.'I just think that he isa pretentious piece of F!A spoilt brat froma privileged backgroundwho just got lucky copying someone'sforeign business model, and now goesaround giving wisdom likehe knows life inside out.I watched his morning routine videoand gosh! The pretentiousnesswas annoying as F###!F### you was my immediate thought!And all the wisdom that he keepsgiving about investment,how does one follow your passion,leave everything and doa startup, etc, etc.Hey ######, it's because of peoplelike you that today's youthis so lost, BC!And this ##### pretentious MCis so damn annoying!'This guy is really really mad at me.I don't know, this was on Reddit.But my apologies man!If I am provoking so manyemotions in you, I must bedoing something that isnot working out for you.One, I am not froma privileged background.I did not see money forthe longest time until 2 years backin my life, and that's the truth,I wish I was spoilt.I don't know if I was...I don't know if I wish I was spoilt,but I know what it is to be spoilt,because I had people around mewho were,and trust me when I say this,I am nowhere close to that.But the fact is, this ishow I come across to you,and that must be telling something,so the way I processthis kind of feedback is,what is it in my conductthat is making people toeven say these things, right?This is fairly intense!So if anyone is taking out timeand sharing their emotionsso deeply that too publicly,commenting something on me,I must be doing somethingwhich has provoked them.And I will just go backand try and think about it.Like he mentionedthe morning routine,so I actually wentand saw that video,and I realized thatwhen I shot that video,it did come acrosslike I was in command,as if I was the one who knew it all.And that's true because,for me, that morning routineis a life hack that I findvery few people going toand following.So I feel that I have discoveredsomething which is so fundamental,and yet so powerful,that I feel, I wish more peopleknew of that.That's it! That's the only feeling!But I do recognize,in that video, the way I spoke,it seemed as if I thinkI know it all, and you allare just kids, you are stilllearning how to live life,I have lived it, so listen to me,because if you will listen to me,you will be blessed.And I am sorry that's how itcame across but that's what it is.Unsubscribe Warikoo!Too much wisdom is not wisdom,it's entertainment!Too much wisdom is not wisdom,it's entertainment!And I get that.I keep sharing a lot of thingson a daily basis.For a lot of people,it would not be wisdom anymore,but entertainment and annoyance.But I am continuing to do that.You are always free not to follow.Finally purchaseda YouTube premium subscriptionjust to stop listening toAnkur Warikoo giving wisdom.Well, you are welcome, YouTube.I hope that you like the moneycoming in because of meand I hope that this makes you happy.Only a few of the largertrolls and hate thingsthat I keep getting.As you would have figured,all these things don't affect me,and it's very important to ask why?Which is what I want you to reflect on.You people are growing up insuch a generation of social mediawhere every day anybody can sayanything to you and move ahead,and you have to deal withthe resident residual emotions.You would never come to knowwho that person was,what animosity that personhas with you,what are the emotions,nothing whatsoever.It's completely anonymous!And the only way to dealwith this is,to keep reminding yourselfthat if there is any personwho you would not ask forhelp or suggestionthen whatever they may say,it will not affect you.If it is anybody that you willnever approach for life advice,then you will never ever reactto whatever that person is saying.When you bring that awarenessinside of you, you will realizethat there are very very few peoplewho can really affect you in life.And that will be your immediate family,your closest friends,and you yourself.If you know your own self,if you are completely in lovewith your own self,trust me there is no onewho can bother you.On that note,Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
