It's like Formula 1.In Formula 1,the car has the main role.The car is a technological feat,it is a technology marvel.An insanely high level of technologyis used in it,because of which it can workat a certain speed,it doesn't burn out,it can turn in a controlled manneron a curve,it can overtake,of course, safety precautions are there.Yes, the driver is there,yes, the team is there,but they are all parts ofthis whole machinery.Imagine, a car that is driving by itself.A lot of people have worked really hardto build that car,but when we see the car running,there is only the car and nothing else,and that could be the future.And my prediction will be the futurein 2050.Number 6:Working from office.Now the whole world stepsout of their houses to go to the office,and then steps out of the officein the evening to go to their houses,and that's how their life goes on.Come what may,you have to go to the office.And yes, work-from-home and hybridstarted because of Covid.But the biggest thing is,even if it is hybrid right now,you have to be in the same cityas your office.My prediction is that by 2050,all of this will be gone.By 2050, the whole world will be connectedso seamlessly that you can workfor anybody fromanywhere in the world.The whole world will workand exist in a metaverse.You would join a meeting,and through the VR lens,you will be in a meeting roomwhere all your team members and clientswill be present virtually irrespectiveof where they are in the worldin actual life,and you will be able to go through that.You will work at your own pace,and you will be wherever you are.Whether you are in Timbuktu, Shimla,Agra, Kanpur, or a new country,it doesn't matter,you will be working in companiesacross the world,you will be accessing locationsacross the world,and all of that will happen in 2050.According to me, office is dead in 2050.Number 7:Eating meat.I'm not saying this becauseI'm a vegetarian,and I want the whole worldto be vegetarian.No!I don't love animals that much.I do, but I'm not giving this reasoningbecause of that level.My reasoning is slightly different.My reasoning is purelya scientific reason,that climate change isa big thing impacting our countryand the entire world right now.The biggest impact of climate changeis global warming.And because of the gradual global warming,the snow on the poles,North and South Pole, will start melting,and if that starts melting,the sea level will rise,and if the sea level will rise,then the cities near the seawill start drowning.This is just one of the many changeshappening because of climate change.And the big reason is the warmingof the earth.The warming of the earth is calledthe greenhouse effect wherethe sun's rayspenetrate Earth's atmosphere,but they don't exit, they are blocked.And meat contributes to 60% ofthe gas emissions in food production.So whatever we cook for anybodyon this earth,60% of the gas emitted from that,which contributes to greenhouse effect,comes from meat production only.So the big reason is that the animalswe raise for meat produce methanewhich absorbs this heat,and starts warming up the earth.So my prediction is that scientistsand all of us will know more about it,accept it, and will make changesbecause it is necessary forour own existence.And by 2050, the meat will not comefrom animals.We may still consume it,but it may be lab meat,or artificially produced meat,or plant-based meat.Whatever the form is, I don't knowthat and I'm not predicting that.My prediction is that by 2050,we will stop consuming meatby killing animals in real life.Number 8:A prediction that could be excitingbut depressing too.Traveling will reduce a lot.In fact, my prediction is that onlythe richest peoplewill travel in real life.The common public like us,will wear a VR lens,and get transported instantlyto a new world,with our family, or friends.So, the plans for Goa thatare never fulfilled,you will actually get it doneat the click of a button.You will be able to accessany location through a metaverse.You can go to Italy if you want to,Goa if you want to, and the qualityof that experience will determinethe price of that experience.So, it will be very less,because there would be no flight tickets,no hotel tickets, no other expenses,only the expense of the VR lensand the experience.But the expense of that experiencewill determine how high-quality experienceyou are getting to experience.And you will have all your friends.You will have anyone that you want.It could be your family,anybody with whom you want to travel.And my prediction for 2050 is thatwe will stop traveling as a real concept.Many people find it depressing,and many find it very exciting,but I don't know what it will do to usas a civilization.But the prediction only is thattraveling by 2050 will almost be dead.Number 9:A very exciting prediction!They will be no kitchens in houses.What??Think about it this way.100 years ago,we used to make our own clothes.If we want to make a salwar kameez,or a kurta pajama, or shirt-pants,we used to stitch it ourselves.But now, we buy them from the market.Somebody stitches them,mass produces them, puts them in shops,and we buy them from shopsor order online.In the same way,we have also started ordering food online.But we still have a kitchen at home,and we cook something there.Think about this,a house has a factory called the kitchen.In that factory,we try to put a gas stove, utensils,a food processor, a mixie,a juicer, a grinder, an oven, OTG,and all that is not necessary,because you can access all these thingsfrom a common facility.Every house doesn't have a gym, right?A gym is in a colonyor a common compound or a common market,and people then go there and consume that,or even in a basement.It becomes a very smart thingto do to have this infrastructurebuilt at a common level.And this is nothing new.It is very common in Indian villages.If you ever go to Punjab,flour is made in homes,and then there is a common tandooror oven in the village,where we make breads.This is how it happens.And my prediction is that in 2050,it will be the same.Imagine that you livein an apartment complex,parking used to be in the basement,but since there would be no carsso there will be no parking.Remember the prediction?We don't own cars, we don't drive cars,somebody else does it for us,or they run automatically.And we will then use that basementfor a kitchen infrastructure,where you can cook there yourself,somebody can cook for you,you can order from there,and all of this will be possiblebecause it'll be a common infrastructure.Everybody would have access to it,and you'll still get high-quality food,home-cooked food, and fast foodin the way that you want,but you won't have to havea kitchen at home.In fact, my prediction is thatif there is a housewith a kitchen in 2050,it will be sold at a premium,because no one really wants it,so if you really want it,you have to pay more for it.And number 10:My favorite prediction.By 2050, we will not live only on Earth,we would have built a new world.Whether on the moon, on Mars,or anywhere else, who knows?!But it is important forour civilization as well.It is not just Elon Musk's imaginationor his desire, it is a necessity.We have reached a placein our civilization wherewe are capable of blowing up the earthin a few seconds.Nuclear power has become destructive,but we still don't have a solution,if we have to save this civilizationand move out, then how will we do that?So it is necessary for us to takethose steps for the progressof this civilization.We have to establish a new world.I don't know where would it be,but my prediction is that by 2050,that world would be established.Some of us would be ready to go there,or would already be there,and would be starting a new worldand that would be necessaryfor our civilization to move forward.So these were my 10 random predictionsfor 2050.We will play a fun game.It is almost like a time capsule.Write in the comments section,from these 10 predictions,which prediction do you thinkwill be correct in 2050?I may not be alive by 2050,you all would be there,so you can come back to this video,and we will all jointly,maybe my virtual avatar will host this,we will host a live session,and we will see all these 10 predictionsof 2050 one by one,and then establishwhich of them came true,and if yes, then in what form,or which one didn't come true at all?And then basis that you will knowwhich of your predictionshave also come true.This will be fun!Ankur
