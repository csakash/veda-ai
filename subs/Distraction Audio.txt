If you get distracted easily,then I will share 14 ways with you throughwhich you can stop getting distracted.Friends, according to me,the biggest disease in this worldis distractions,because our brain is divided intoso many things,and there is so much information thathits us every single moment of the day,that it is very difficult to remainfocused.In this video, I'll share with you 14 waysthat I myself use in my own lifeto remain focused, and avoid distractions,not avoid, sorry,try to remove or eliminate distractions.Step number 1 to remove distractions:Your phone is the greatest sourceof your distraction.And whenever we swipe up on our phoneor open it using our face ID,our home screen yells at us,because there are so many appsreaching out to us saying,'Open us! Open us! We're here!'So a great way for you to actually avoidgetting distracted and to remain focusedis to keep your home screenabsolutely clean.You can see my phone's home screen.There's only one main appon the whole screen,which is my meditation.There are 4 icons belowwhich are the most important for me.Calling, checking emails, the calendar,and my music, nothing else besides these.Everything else is on screen 2, screen 3,or beyond, they are in groups,so I can't access them easily,and believe me that this small changecan bring so much focus in your life,because whenever you open your phone,you will see a clear view.Number 2:Despite all this, there will be some appswhere you waste your time.It could be YouTube Shorts,it could be Instagram Reels,anything else where you pass your timeand you don't even realize that,and then you regret it.To stop all this, you will have to usea time-blocking app.iOS or Apple already hasa time block systemwhich is called screen time,and you can use screen time to keepa daily or weekly limit to every app.Android also has this featureby the name of digital wellbeing.You can use both of these waysor download any other time-blocking appto limit your time on any appthat you spend time on.Here is another bonus tip.All these apps...Now, how do these apps work?For example, I have set a daily limitof 1 hour on Instagram.I spend half an hour on my contentwhere I reply to people,and give like on their comments,and then half an houron my own consumptionwhere I watch the Reelsand a lot of other content,I follow the people who I want to follow.After the one hour is over,I get a notification,'Your time is over, would you liketo extend it?'And the option to extend it comes witha passcode or without a passcode.You will enter a passcode,and you will not enter that passcode,you will get it done by your parentsor your friends, and they will not sharethis passcode with you.So this is a way to remain disciplined.As soon as that one hour or whatever timeyou've decided for yourself finishes,the app will also be over.If it is very important,like I have an Instagram live on Fridayswhich is from 10 to 11,and I need an extension for that hour,that's when I enter the passcode,and that is the only timethat I actually go out of my limit.If I have to extend iton any other rare occasion,I can do it, but I've broughtthis self-discipline after many years.You might not have it right now,so don't rely on it, and give the passcodeto your parents or your siblingsor your friends,and tell them,'Don't share the password with me,I want to restrict myself to this time.'Number 3:Remove all the notificationsfrom your phone.This is critical!We always remain slaves of notificationsand that is the wrong wayto live your life.It should not be like there is some popupfrom WhatsApp or some like from Twitteror Instagram!No!You will only check the appwhen you have scheduled that.There's another hack for thiswhich I will tell you later,but you'll put off all the notifications.All the unread badges which are visibleon the top of the icons,number 7, number 8,the number of unread notificationsor unread emails,remove that too!You don't want any triggerswhen you are opening your phone,because these are the triggersthat make you open those apps,and when you open that app,their algorithm sucks you in such a waythat it becomes very hard to escape that.Number 4:This is a very interesting one!When you wake up in the morning,get up slowly,don't be in a hurry to get up.I often see that if somebody hasa meeting at 9 a.m, or they have to reachcollege at 9:00 a.m,they wake up just in time.Whenever you wake up just in time,you always feel rushed.Have breakfast quickly,take a quick shower,and get ready quickly, and in this haste,you lose your balance.When you are asleep,your body gets to rest,assuming that you have slept well,and then slowly bring it back toyour daily activity.For example, when I wake upin the morning,I drink a glass of water for 15 minutes,it's almost as if I am drinking teaor sipping wine,and that is my way of waking up slowly.At that time I have no phone, no book,no music, and no other person,only me and my thoughts,maybe I am remembering some of my dreams,I sometimes sit in the balcony,sometimes I sit on the sofa,and drink water comfortably.And I cannot even begin to tell youthat if you have this privilege,then how good you would feel by using it,and that will make your start of the dayvery focused.Number 5:We are often distractedbecause our mind wanders,but often we are also distracted becauseour energy levels are low.And a direct proxy of energy levelsis the glucose level in our body.Perhaps you haven't eaten properlyor have eaten less, so your glucose levelswill continue to vary.For some 3 months, I used to havea glucometer with me,which regularly used to tell methe level of my glucose.It helped me a lot because I got to knowwhich food to eat, fried food,cheesy food or fatty food,eating a lot of sugar,all these lead to an absolute spikein glucose,and as soon as the spike occurs,it drops very quickly too.And as soon as your glucose level drops,your body thinks that I am hungry,and your energy level dips,then you start eating something random,or because of hunger or because of energy,you are unable to focus.So it is very importantthat whatever food you eat,have it at a normal level.Neither eat too much, nor eat less,keep eating regularlyso that your body's glucose levelis maintained.In fact, I would say that as soonas your attention starts getting weak,eat a Parle-G biscuit, just one!And just see if that makes a difference.Very often, it will actually makea difference because it will slightlyraise the glucose level,and you will be able to be attentive againwith that energy.Number 6:There is a time in the whole daywhen our energy is at its peak.For me, it is morning,maybe for you, it is evening or night.Every person has a different energy periodwhere their energy is maximum,that is the time when you have to doyour most difficult and important work.Since your energy is weak at other times,if you take the most importantor difficult work at that point,you'll not be able to do a good job of it.As I said, my mornings are my best period,so I schedule all my important meetingsand discussions in the morning.And I use my afternoon for consumption,content browsing, my writing which isas important but not as difficultas the first half, and that allows meto focus my maximum energy on the taskthat is most important.Number 7: Pomodoro technique.I have often spoken about this technique.It's a very effective techniquewhere you work in half an hour slots.This technique is proven to maximizethe attention span.You work for 25 minutesthen take a break for 5 minutes,again work for 25 minutesand take a break for 5 minutes,again 25 minutes and 5 minutes.One 30-minute slab is called one Pomodoro.And after 4-5 Pomodoros,you take a long half-hour break.There are a lot of free appsto track all this.If you search Pomodoro on Android,you will see a lot of appsthat will make you aware of this techniqueand help you measure it as well.So you'll start the clock,work for 25 minutes,then an alarm will ring,you'll take a 5-minute break,again an alarm will ring,again your work for 25 minutesor do whatever you are doing,then again a 5-minute break,and so on and so forth.And after 4-5 Pomodoros,you take a long break.It's effective and works really well.Number 8:We often get carried away in our thoughts.We will be reading, or doing something,and then all of a sudden,we start daydreaming,or our to-do list will start.'Oh! this has to be done,that has to be done,this had to be done, I forgot this.'Our to-do list never ends.I have a very impactful wayto eliminate distractions,do not try to remember anything!I do not try to remember anything!I document everything.And I document in such a waythat I can remind myself of itthrough technology.What did I say?I am able to surface it so thatI don't have to remember it,and whenever I have to do that task,it'll automatically appear in front of me.For example, using Google calendar.Through Google Calendar,I don't have to remember any event.I have to meet this person at this time,I have this interview at this time,or a catch-up at this time,I have to have a discussion at some time,everything is on the calendar.My whole life is on the calendar.I often write emails to myselffor the future.So let's say, I just saw somethingbut I can't do anything about itright now,I can do something only after a month,so I won't try to remember it.I'll write an email to myself,describe everything I know right now,and try to send that email backto my inbox a month later,not try,but schedule it for a month later.So after 1 month that emailwill come to me,and I read my emailsand read them diligently,so I will not miss that email,and when that email comes,then I will remember,'Hey, I had to do this thing a month ago,or I remembered itand I have to do it now,and that's why I can do it.Important: Not to remember anything.Always keep a notebook,pen and paper with you,so that you transfer the memory ofwhat you have to do to a document,and your mind is used only forconsumption and comprehension.Number 9:The biggest challenge in today's world,information is coming from all sides,and if the information is comingfrom everywhere,you will always be distracted,and keep feeling FOMO because informationis coming from everywhere.You have to restrict yourinformation sources.I have only 3 information sourcesin my life.Email, Twitter, and WhatsApp.Apart from this, I do not consumeinformation from any other medium, yes,I read the newspaper in the morning,which may be the fourth one,but I read it with passion,not regularly or frantically.But I get my news from Twitter.If any information is needed from WhatsAppwhich cannot come from email,then I get that.And most of the information is receivedby email through my team or anyone else.These are my information sources.I don't try to gather informationfrom anywhere else.I don't search for anything on Instagram.Of course, I'll search on Googleif I have to but that is meseeking information.I am getting information randomly,then I would restrict it tothese 3 sources only.That's what you have to do as well.Nowadays, all of you have Telegram,Discord, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn,and you get information from allthese places without you controlling it,so it is naturally going to make you feelthat you are missing out on something,FOMO will kick in and that's whyyou will be perpetually distracted.Don't make that happen to you.Number 10:Whatever these information sources are,whether it is two, or three,there should not be more than 3,for these, whenever any information comes,then you will not consume itright there and then, you will schedule.For example, my emails come to my inboxonly three times a day.I have used a software throughwhich my emails are paused,and my emails arrive in my inboxonly at 8:00 am, 12:30 pm, and 6:00 pm.That is my way of saying that at 8:00 a.m,when all the emails would have come in,and I often sit down to workaround 9:00 a.m,then at 9:00 a.m,I'll look at all the emailsthat came in at night,and within half an hour,I'll be able to finish them all.The emails that would have arrivedat 12:30, which is the peak of the day,so I will finish them by 1:00 pm.Before ending the day in the evening,I will finish all the emailsthat have come at 6:00 pmwithin half an hour,and have my dinner by 6:30.That is how you have to bring claritytowards these information sources.Same thing for Twitter, the same thingfor WhatsApp.How do I do it?I'll tell you about it in the next point.Number 11:Twitter and WhatsApp are ongoing,then how to stop it?Because there is no software for it.So I set up a distraction time.Often we are distracted because we feelthat we should not be distracted.So like forbidden fruit,when we are told not to do something,then we enjoy more while doing it.As we used to do in childhood,when our parents used to scold usnot to do something,then we just had to do it.So, that is how our human brain works.But if you actually schedulea proper distraction time,then your mind will not be so flickering.So for example, I tell myself thatthere are 3 slots of half an hourduring my day when I will waste my time!These are the times I have scheduledto waste time, and that's why my minddoesn't wander away because it knowsthat the half-hour slot is approaching.I do whatever I want to doin that half an hour.I watch Reels, see some memes,or do something else,and I feel great about it.And then after half an hour,I get back to work becausethat is my Pomodoro break as well.This is such a great hack whereif you schedule a distraction timefor yourself or have it in your routine,then suddenly, the reasonsto get distracted reduce big time.Number 12:Now while working, or studying,you've already scheduled distraction time,but even then if you get distracted,something comes to mind, something to do,or so on and so forth,then keep a description notebook.A book where you will writewhat is distracting you.When you do that, you automaticallytell your brain thatI've dumped this thing,and now I don't have to think about itanymore,and our brain is very smart aboutall these things.So as soon as it realizes that the thingwith which it was trying to distract you,you have written it down in a notebook,the brain will think,'Great! He had to be distracted,it's done, now I can move on.'And they will actually let you go,and then you can come back to the focus.It works brilliantly well!Number 13:Often we get distracted by the thingsthat we have to do, the to-do listthat I mentioned.But there are many such thingsthat we can do very quickly,but even then we add themto the to-do list,don't do it!There is something calledthe 2-minute rule.If anything can be donewithin 2 minutes or less,do it right away.Why?Because our brain is hardwired to focuson the things we haven't finished yet.When you finish something,your mind lets you free.Anything that you can do within 2 minutes,please do it, and nip it in the bud,so that your brain doesn't keep remindingthat you have to do this thing.Number 14:The most important, make a routine.If you do not make a routine in life,then your mind and your focuswill not work together in a rhythm.Your whole body and your emotional senseswill never get alignedbecause they will keep flickering.Somedays you sleep at 9, some days at 1.Some days you sleep for 7 hours, some daysfor 14 hours.So your body will always be confused.But if you have a routinewhere you determine when you sleep,for how long, when you eat,when you wake up, when you get ready,then that sets a rhythm,and that rhythm gives you clarity,and that clarity gives you focus.It is very very important that you builda routine in your life.No matter what age you are,and many people tell me,'Hey, we keep on studying for 16 hours,we keep working for 18 hours,so how do we make a routine?'Despite that, a routine can be made.I am not saying that you've to doeverything, and that is called routine.No!I am saying that it is very importantto make a routine for whatever thingsyou have to do in the day,it is very important to schedulea time for that.And until you don't do that,distraction will always be somethingthat can quickly happen.Remember that in the days of our parents,a very important parameter of successwas IQ, intelligence, brain,but today a very big parameter of successis the focus.I often say that focus is the new IQ.If you can focus in this world whereeverything is trying to distract you,you are the smartest,you are the most powerful,and I hope these 14 tips are a way for youto conquer distractions.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
