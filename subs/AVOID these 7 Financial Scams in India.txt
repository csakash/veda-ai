Number 1: Binary options trading.Binary options trading is a veryhigh-risk, high-return game.I am saying game becausein a way, it is a game.I don't mean to call it ascam because it is not a scam.It is legal by the way.It happens in India,but in this,you have to predict fora certain period thatthe price of a stock, commodity,index, anything else, will it behigher than or lower than a certainvalue at a given point of time.If your answer is right,then you will win.If the answer is not right, thenyour entire investment is over.And this makes it like a gamblebecause at the end of it,being able to determine theprice is a very risky affair.There are so manymoving parts that nomatter how technicallyequipped you are,you will lose at some point.And if you lose, then yourentire investment is gone,which is why it seemslike a great place tobe for overnightreturns or quick returns,but my suggestion would be that ifyou want to play a long-term game,in a long run, in a right way,without losing your sleep,then binary options trading maynot be the right one for you.Number 2: Chit Funds.Chit funds are like when ourmothers throw a kitty party.So people pool in. It becomes a pool of money,and a person gets all thatmoney at a certain point.Now the risk there is not somuch that it doesn't work.There are many chit funds that work.In fact, I rememberthat my dad's very firstinvestment was in a chit fund called Newton Chit Fund.And I still remember that he used tofill in papers of Newton Chit Fund.He put whatever moneyhe had to in the fund.And thankfully, that worked and that doesn't mean that it is a scam.But high risk happens because youare dealing with individual savers,and God forbid,if that person runs away orgoes missing or takes the money,then the entire systemcan collapse overnight,because a member defaultinghas a domino effect.Everyone is linked to each other,and somewhere or the other, if a single person goes off the line,it can cause severe damageto the entire process.This happened in India.There was a chit fundof Shraddha Group,which was collectingmillions of rupeesfrom investorsand retail investors.All doing it maybewith the right reasons.And then in 2013, it collapsed.It couldn't pay back themoney to investors andthe entire investmentalmost disappeared overnight.So again, if you want tomake money the right way,then chit funds may not bethe right place for you.The amount of risk they have,according to that, their return is not corresponding,and you can get the samereturn in less risky assets, which is what you should consider.Number 3: Multi-Level Marketingor MLMs.MLMs are veryinteresting and accordingto me, it was a veryinnovative approachbut at some point of time,because there is so much dependency, they began to falter.The premise is very simple.The premise is that ifI sell you something,then you become mydisciple in a way,and if you go ahead andsell it to two more people,then not only you,but because I introducedyou to this system,I also earn money.And then, the ones you sold to,if they go ahead and sellit to two more people,then it will be a total of 4 people.So, you will get the earnings ofthose 4 people who sold it to you,you will also getand I will also get,and the system flows back.So you can imagine that introducingpeople to a MLM is so preciousbecause every person whom youare bringing into this pyramid,he will bring as manypeople as possible,and the people they bring,you will keep earningthrough all of them.Now this sounds interesting to hear.It's almost like this is a verylow effort and a very high reward.Just bring one person and ifthey turn out to be right, then they will do a miracle for us.But you can also imaginethe risk attached to thatbecause at one point,the pool of money startsbecoming smaller and smaller.And wherever anyone deviatesfrom the line and does anything,the entire pyramidcomes down falling.Think about it, one person introduced 2 people,they introduced 4 people,they introduced 8 people, they introduced 16 people,and if even one personamong those 16 falls,then the entire pyramid can fall.There was a similarsystem called Speak Asia,which was a marketing survey company.They used to pay people tofill the marketing survey,and it was like a Ponzischeme where you tookmoney from somewhereand paid someone else with it,but it's not a big business.It was exposed in 2011 and it wasrealized that this was all a sham.And overnight, everyone's money,everyone's investments disappeared.Number 4: Penny stocks.I have made this mistake.So MLMs, please resist them.The most prone are MLMs' retiredindividuals and housewivesbecause they feel that a lot of moneycan be made in a very short time.So let's try and do that,and they are the mostvulnerable to this scheme. Please make them aware,and never get involved in this yourselfbecause it is legitimate,it is innovativebut the risk againattached to it is far,far higher for thereward that it promises.Number 4: Penny stocks,and this is the best reflectionof human nature.Suppose you have â¹1,000 to invest,and I tell you that thereis a stock worth â¹500,buy 2 of them.And you are like,a stock worth â¹500,even if it becomes â¹510,then how much money will I earn?â¹20.For how much money? â¹1,000.No.One more friend comes and says, there is a stock worth â¹5,buy that.So how many stocks will you buy? 200.200 stocks. And that â¹5,even if it becomes â¹6,meaning it will only increase by â¹1, how much money will you earn?â¹200.Means â¹200 per â¹1,000,20% return.You are like, this is what we should do.What we fell into thetrap was pure greed,and these penny stocksalways guarantee this.My first stock purchase was a penny stock. I also made this mistake.There is an Indian companycalled Karuturi Network,which is a rose manufacturer.There are gardens in Africa.Apparently the world's number 2rose manufacturer or producer.There was a stock worth â¹4 or â¹5.I bought a few hundred.I had that much money,so I put â¹400-500.That increased to â¹11.So that same â¹500 became â¹1,000.Wow!I sold it for â¹11.The stock fell again to â¹3 or â¹4.I bought it again.That again went to â¹11, I sold it again. That again came to â¹3,I bought it again,and all my life, it wasstuck between â¹0.50 and â¹1.I never earned money for it.I don't even know when I sold it,but this was what happened.Penny stocks are fora reason penny stocks.Try to understand thatthe amount of a stockis determined by thecompany's financials.If the company'sfinancials are not strong,its market share is not strong,growth is not strong,management is not strong,revenue is not strong,profit growth is not strong,then it will reflectin the stock price,and if you bet onthat thing that it is so cheap,you will get a lot of stocks,and with â¹0.50 or â¹1 increase, a lot of money will be made.You are making thesimple mistake that almosteveryone with a basichuman nature tends to make.Don't do it.In the 1990s and early 2000s,there was a stockbrokernamed Ketan Parekhwho made a lot ofnoise in penny stocks,and because of him,there was a big explosionlike Harshad Mehta.Have you seen Wolf of Wall Street?I don't know if you've seen it or not.It's a Leonardo DiCaprio movie.Very interesting,based on a true story.The movie is based on thestory of Jordan Belfort.He used to engage in penny stocks,and because of penny stocks,he earned a lot of money for himself.Of course, at the expense of a lot ofpeople who falteredand lost a lot of money.Don't do it.If you are investing in stocks, invest in legit stocks.Stocks with good revenue,good profit growth,good management,good market share.Something which you know is going tokeep growing in the future as well.Invest in fundamentals. That is my suggestionbecause then you areinvesting for the long term and investing the right way.Number 5: Advance Fee Fraud.In this fraud, someonewill call you and say,"Friend, it's a great scheme. Double the money night and day.There is no need to invest now. Just subscribe to the scheme.It will cost you â¹1,000.After that, you willget a chance to earn alot of money basedon whatever you invest."You will say, "Okay,â¹1,000 is nothing.Let's get into the scheme.Then we will see."You give â¹1,000.The scheme is gone. It's gone.Now this is a very basic level.You will say, "No one will fallfor this stupidity, right?"But you will be surprised.When greed is presented toyou in different shapes,every person starts falling for it.And that is why it's veryimportant for you to recognize thatto make any investment,if you ever have topay upfront fees,you should be on your guardbecause the bestplaces rarely do that.If you take a PMS or aPortfolio Management Scheme,if you recruit a financial advisor,if you open a stock brokerage account,or open a Demat account,you never have to payan upfront amount.If you have to pay,it is very minimal,and if you ever have to pay,please check the authenticity of it.Most payments are ona transaction basis.So, PMS is also there.It will take apercentage of your totalinvestment amounton a transaction basis.When a mutual fundcharges an expense ratio,on the basis of how much you invest,an expense ratio is calculatedand it deducts as perthe expense ratio.If you buy a stock ina Demat or if you trade,the amount you trade,a percentage of it ora flat fee is charged.It doesn't take it upfront.All of these aresymbols of partnerships.When you deploy your money,and we help you,only then will we earn money.Not before you,and this is the basic smell testwhich I always do in an investment. I will never pay fees in advance,and even if I do,it will be a well-known,validated,vetted brand.Number 6:Real Money Gaming Platforms.These are not frauds.In fact, these scams are not frauds.They are all legal.They all exist.The question is,does their risk and returnmatch or not?I have called them financial scamsto create a little sensationbut you are smart enough to figurethat I am just being click-baityand not being true.The biggest problem inreal money gaming isthat it may notalways be skill-based.Often, it is luck-based.And whatever is luck-based,whether you win or lose,you have no control over it.That can be a spiral.I can't show you,because those are private emails.Every day,I get at least 2-3 emailsof people who are like,â¹2 lakhs,â¹3 lakhs,â¹5 lakhs,14 lakhs,I have lost that much moneyin real money gaming,and I keep playingso that I can recover that money.So the challenge is notthat you lose in luck once.The challenge is thatas you start losing in gambling,you start playing moreso that you can recoverthe amount you lost,and this is the trapthat we all fall in.I want to save you from this trap.Please don't make this mistake.If you want to play real money gamingfor fun, for entertainment,play it.Best will beplay with virtual money.Then there is no load.You are playing it for entertainment.You are not playing it for the money.So, there is no subconscious biasthat money shouldn't be lost.I am not playing withsomeone else's money.Why am I betting on this money?You are playing it for the fun of it,for the entertainment of it.Just like we play video games,you can also play withthis virtual money,but wherever real money is involved,and there is an element of luck,you have to be veryvery cautious.Number 7:Peer to peer lending.This is a very big risk,according to me at least.In peer-to-peer lending,through a platform,you give money to someone on a loan.And who is that someone?Someone like you.Someone needs the amount,Someone is ready to give the amount,and in between, theplatform takes a fee.The challenge isall these loans are non-collateralized.Nothing has been mortgaged for this.So there is no way foryou to claim that amount,if by chance it gets defaulted.So, suppose you havegiven â¹2,000 to someone,and that person for whatever reasonis not capable of giving back.It may bebecause they genuinely can't,It may be because they don't want to.Any reason, it doesn't matter.Now how will this â¹2,000 be claimed?Most of the platforms say that,We will safeguard you.But how is that platform safeguarding you?It is doing it becauseit is funded by a VC.So, the day VC's money is lost,or someone realizes thatthere is a lot of defaultand we can't supportall these defaults.For how long will we do it?Then they will also raise their hands.And suddenly, there is a domino effect.Just because you didn'tget your â¹2,000 back,you would have takenit from someone else,then they won't be able to return it.So, all of them won'tbe able to pay back,and the entire P2P network collapses.This happened in China.There was a platform in China,Ezubao.E-Z-U-B-A-OI think that's how youpronounce it, Ezubao,and Ezubao was a very famous,P2P network.Peer-to-peer lending network.It used to promise very insane rates.12%, 15%, 18%.But one day, it collapsed.It was figured thatit was a Ponzi scheme.Where was the money coming from?Someone else deposited.So, that money was given to you,And then, you handled it.Now you will hope that someoneelse will deposit the money.So, someone else will be dealt with it.And it continued,but one day, if the deposits stopped coming,then the withdrawals also stopped.And that's it. Game over.This is the big challenge.I won't take names,because these are legit businesses,and they are allowed in some way.So then, if the governmentis not stopping them,then who am I to stoptaking their names,but you should always be aware,in my opinion.The peer-to-peer networks arebuilt on a very fragile ground,where if they start defaulting,which will always happen in a recession,and in a hard economic time,it will have a domino effect,and your money can be lost.So, if you genuinely wanta fixed rate of return,then invest in government securities.Invest in FD.If you can't deal with volatility,then don't invest in stock market,but there are many other schemeswhich can give you 7-10%,and you should invest there itselfinstead of 12 or 15% luckbecause the risk attachedto that is fairly high.So these were the 7 scams.Now I will add an8th one with thisbecause there will be a lot of peoplewho will watch this video and say,"Ankur, you are a hypocritebecause you didn't takethe name of that thingin which you yourself are trapped,and that is cryptocurrency.Cryptocurrency is ascam to a lot of people,and I am totally okay with thatbecause understanding it,and appreciating itsimplications and applications,is not something that Iwould expect from everyone.I am not saying that I am very smart,or that I know somethingthat you don't know,but I am a firmbeliever in crypto.And because of that,I have invested in my own crypto.I have constantly been stating,that 1 Bitcoin, 10 Ethereum, 100 Solana,acquiring this is my goal.The cost of this on today's terms,is about â¹30-32 lakhs,which I have reached,and that is something that I am now sitting on.I have no ambition to sell this.I genuinely believe that thefuture of currency tomorrowis crypto and built on blockchain,and I am patient that the pointat which it becomes clear,I will stand to gainfrom this ownership.However, there are a lot ofplatforms that are unregulated.The government had put a mandate thatCrypto is not somethingthat Indians should own.Even if they do,it has to be clearly disclosed.It has to be put in income tax return.I do all those things.You will also have to do it.In my current ITR file,all the crypto that I have sold,I have declared all that,and there was one platform,that I was working withwhich unfortunately on 4th July 2022,by the name of Vauld,collapsed.And there are a lot ofreasons why it collapsed.I will not get into thatbecause I am not technicaland that matter isstill in jurisdiction,but my own money went into it.I have no hope of recovering that,though a recovery process is going on,But the bigger messagethat I want to share is,it is absolutely okayif you think that crypto isa financial scheme or fraud.In which case, the best thing to dois don't invest.Like I said, the 7 options,These 7 options thatI shared with you,all of them are technically legal.The government allows them.There is no restriction till now.This means you cantechnically invest in them,and be above the law.The only question is:Do you want to do it or not?And that becomes a question ofpersonal finance and personal risk.If you find risk in these 7 options,then it is quite possible thatyou find it in crypto too,in which case do not invest.Simple.Always.I stand by only one thingwhen it comes to investment.It's that no investmentcan be so importantthat you lose sleep because of it.So, do not make any suchinvestment in your lifebecause of which you lose sleepbecause that investmentis not worth it.Never is.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
