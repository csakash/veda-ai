Check 1 2 check okIf you have started yourinvesting journey or not,or if you have started itbut are confused about what to do,then in this video, I am goingto introduce a concept calledthe pyramid way looking at investments.A mechanism through which youcan understand your risk and your amount.Friends, so I was recently catching upwith two of my friends,whom I know for the past 10-12 years,and we generally meet once a month,and bond together on a lot of things,so our discussion started on investment.And one of my friends called Bali,I call him Bali because hislast name is Bali, he excitedlytook out a pen and paper and said,'I have totally understand how to invest!'And he made a pyramidand plotted some things on it.I found this concept very interestingand I said to him,'Bali I am going to make a video on this.'I took a picture and promised himthat I'll make a video on this,so this video is because of thatconversation on one random eveningconverted into a way of thinkingabout investing.In this video, I will introduceevery investing type which you canmostly evaluate to put your money in,but I will add two more things on it.Number 1, how much risk are youtaking in each asset,because every asset that you invest inhas a different risk profile.And secondly, how much minimum amount willyou have to invest for you to eveninvest into that asset meaningfully.We will try to make a pyramid throughthis and in this pyramid,we will try to get to knowthat if in your 20s and havejust started investing,or if you are in your mid-twentiesand have been investing, or if you arein your 30s or 40s and are alreadyinvesting but are confused whetherit is working or not, then how do you get toa balance of that risk and that amount?Let's startOkSo at this point Aditya,we will bring in the screen recording.It's obvious, if we are talkingabout investing then an Excel sheethas to be used, so an excel sheetis right in front of you.And you can see a pyramid onit which has two things,one, the increasing risk,and two, the amount that youshould invest or will have to invest.Let's try to understand these two.First of all, what is a risk?Risk means how much volatilityor fluctuation will you have to seeto get a consistent returnover a long period of time.For example, if you buy a houseor an office as a real estate investmentthen its pricing doesn't fluctuate much,that too over a long period of time.So it is not like the stock marketwhere there are instant fluctuations,so on and so forth, and that meansyou are risk for buying that assetis more or less a stable risk,you will not see much fluctuation in it.But if you compare it to something like,I don't know, crypto or stock investing,then it is risky, right?It will fluctuate.It is very important to know thatwhen I say risk I do not meanit in a bad way.If you can measure the risk properly,then that risk can prove to be profitablefor you, because the biggestand the most fundamental rule of investing is:The higher the risk, the higherwill be the return.You can never have high returns with low risk.Fundamentally, it will be high onlywhen you are ready to take a higher riskbut the volatility during that timeis something that you have to manage.That is the increasing riskand it's in the shape of a pyramidbecause by definition, if you investanywhere in any way, then you shouldhave the least amount of investment donein the highest risk category,and the most amount of investmentdone in the least possible risk category.How will this work?We will get to know.The second thing is the amountthat you should invest or willhave to invest.Now, what are these two things?Should invest means you must investthis much amount but there aresome assets in which you haveto invest more money unwillingly.For example, real estate again.If you want to invest in â¹3-5000in a month in real estate,then you will not have an option to do that.Though there are REITs and all,but that's besides the point,I'm talking about a direct purchase.It is really really hard to doan SIP in real estate.So, you have to generate aquantum of lakhs, and then only youcan make a real estate investment.But if you want to buy stocks,and let's say, you want to buya Reliance stock, which is forâ¹2500, then you can easily buy thatstock for â¹2500, and that isperfectly fine.So, that means in an asset or inany investing class, there isusually a minimum capital requirement,and that is why the bottom most partof the broad spectrum of the pyramidwill denote the asset which will havethe least risk but the quantumis really high, which means,you will have to invest this much moneyfor you to see anything come out of it.Let's populate this with the categoriesbecause that is what are all thepossible opportunities you haveto invest your money, and then we willtry to know that what are placesyou can invest in depending on yourage and your risk profile.First of all, is real estate.As I said, you need a lump sum toinvest in real estate, and its riskis very less because real estate,if you buy it in the right place,right location, whether it is commercialor residential, it doesn't dip dramatically.There are more chances for it to risebut that may also vary accordingto location, size, or anything else.But fundamentally, real estate isthe foundation of all investing.In India, investors have earneda lot of money through real estate only,and I would not be surprised that it wouldbe true even going forward.But if you are in your 20s,that may not be the best investmentto make.Why?Because it will be a major investmentand you don't want to take thatlow a risk because you are in a positionto take a risk and it may justblock you in and your capitaland you will not have enoughto spend anywhere else.After real estate comes, EPF or PPF.This means, Employee Provident Fundor Public Provident Fund.I have already made a video on this.EPF or PPF are low in the pyramidbecause they have very low risk,guaranteed returns.Since it is through the governmentso the risk is very low, in fact almostzero risk, but they arevery long-term investments.Like, there will be a mandatory15-year lock-in period in PPF,which means, whatever returnyou may want to earn, you will haveto make that 15-year investment.12% from your basic will go intoyour EPF mandatorily, you can of course,decide after watching the video aboutthe conditions, so on and so forth.But at the end of it, it is along-term commitment you have to makeand that is why it is at the bottomof the pyramid, depending on the riskand the quantum of the amountyou have to invest.Then comes our parents' favorite, Fixed Deposit.A fixed deposit will make India...Forget it!Fixed deposit, again low-risk,you have to invest a quantumbecause the rate in a fixed depositis such a joke, that even if youinvest â¹1 lakh in it, then in a yearyou will get â¹5000,what good will those â¹5000 be?And you will even pay tax on those â¹5000,so it's absolutely foolish.The point is, fixed deposit requiresa really large quantum for it to make sense.If, only if, I had â¹10 crores in cashand I would invest it in FD,then I would get â¹50 lakhs every year,and then I can be like,'Ok! Why should I even take anyrisk in life? Because if I amgetting â¹50 lakhs in a year,and even if I give 20-30% tax on itI still get â¹45 lakhs, which means,I am broadly getting â¹4 lakhs in a month,that would be good enough formy expenses, and it would beabsolutely risk-free.'If I am getting â¹4 lakhs a month,that too risk-free, I will investall of my â¹10 crores in an FD.But I don't have â¹10 crores,I think even you don't have itand that's why you watching this video,so that's why if all of us havelimited money, and if we invest ina fixed deposit we would not getgood enough returns which will move any needle,then the quantum that is needed to investis significantly a lot for any Fixed Deposit.Then comes Corporate Bonds.Corporate Bonds are like Fixed Depositsbut Fixed Deposits are given by a bank,whereas in a Corporate Bond thereis a fixed rate of returnand it is given by a company.Suppose a company calledWarikoo Enterprises says, 'I need money,and if I take a loan from a bank,I will have to give 14% interest.Instead, I am ready to give you 12% interest,if you are, let's say aretail investor or another company,then you can lend me money at 12% interest.I will save some moneyand you will also get 12% interest,which is far better than any ratethat you will get if you investanywhere else.'The reason why this is above Fixed Deposit,which means it is riskier becauseevery company has worthiness.This means the company shouldbe capable of paying back the loan.It is a possibility that,for whatever reasons, a company maynot be able to pay back the loan,then your money is in a doldrum.They can't pay because maybe Covid struck,or business went bankrupt,or some default happened,or the customer to whom we were selling,their industry finished,there could be several reasons.I made a video on this, which is aroundcorporate bonds which are openfor retail investors. You can use somethingcalled wintwealth.com for evaluatingall these corporate bonds, and thatcould be a great way for you tofigure out which are thehigh-quality corporate bonds.For example, if a public companyissues these bonds, then youcan say that it is AAA rated,which means it is the highest-rated,so you can invest your money there,so on and so forth.Again, you need a fairly large quantumof money to make investmentsin corporate bonds.It comes with a higher riskand that is why it is there whereit is on the pyramid.Next is, all mothers' love, gold.But gold, not in the form of jewelry,please no, but gold in theform of actual gold.Now there is digital gold as wellso that is also that can be evaluated.The risk is high because thegold pricing keeps fluctuating.It is at this place on the pyramidbecause it still requiresa somewhat sizeable amount of moneybut because of digital goldthat amount is continuously reducing.So, you can actually invest aslow as â¹100-200-500, whatever isyour capability in gold whichis digital gold.You will not buy gold coins or gold bars,definitely not jewelry,and that is why gold is whereit is on the pyramid.Then the next is, is Index Mutual Fund.A portfolio of stocks that investsin the index, either NSE or BSE.This means, as the NSE or BSE rises,your money will also increase.This is the lower risk of allthe stock investments becausethere is always a growth in itover the long term.Of course, there will be a lot ofups and downs in the middle dependingon how the stock market is performingbut broadly over of 5-10 year period,you will get a return of12-15% per year guaranteed.Not a lot of quantum is required.So if you have to invest in,let's say, Reliance and Tataand TCS and HDFC and ICICI and SBI,all the top rankers on the Sensex,then you will have to pay a lot of moneyto buy each stock because you haveto buy at least one stock.But if you buy an Index Mutual Fund,then you buy a unit of the mutual fund,which could be of far lesser valuethan the actual cost of the stocksthat it's investing in.That is why the quantum of moneythat you need to invest in mutual fundsis a lot lesser, and that iswhy it is where it is.The next one is direct Indian stocks.The best thing about direct Indian stocksis that you can get a lot of veryhealthy returns if you buy thestock in the right manner,but research is required for that,a lot of awareness aboutwhy you are buying that stock?What are its fundamentals?What is its technical analysis?What is its fundamental analysis,so on and so forth?So it is a lot of research,which you and I may not be equipped to do,and that is why it is higher risk,because if it goes wrong then yourmoney can go down as against if youinvest in the index, where if one stocktanks then the other one can take care of it,so on and so forth.Whereas if you are investing directlythen it is riskier but by that measure,it can also so give you higher returns.And then US Stocks.Us stocks can be even riskierbecause you don't even knowsitting in India, about why, what,and how are they?Yes, Google and Facebook are somewhatmore stable than any other stock,but if you invest in Google and Facebook,you will not get that much of returns,which you will get by investingin some random companies,where the potential is really highbut you are taking an early bet,especially when they aretechnology companies.For example, I have investedin this stock called Doximity.It's a social network for doctors.Who knew that a social networkfor doctors will work?But I have invested and in thelast 3 months, it has almost givenme 60% returns.It's crazy!Now, of course, that may not be sustained,it is possible that after 3 or 10 yearsthat 60% return would only become 100%or 200% return, but the fact isthat if your money is doublingor tripling in 5-10 years then it's nota bad return, and there was no wayto find that out because a random Indianis betting on a random Doximity,it is technically riskybut the quantum is really low.Why?Why because you can buyfractional shares in the US.Google stock is for $2500,which is around â¹2 lakhs, now you are notgoing to buy one stock worth â¹2 lakhs,but if you have only â¹2000,then you can still buy Google stockwhich will be the fractional amountof that stock and you can buy that.And finally, there is Crypto.Something which has maximum riskand you can start it with a minimum amount.When you look at this pyramid,this will basically tell you whereyou can make your risk-adjusted profileon all of these elements.And what I want to do now is giveyou a broad ballpark of what youcould decide depending on your age,and thus how much risk should you take.Ultimately everything is anindividual preference, so pleaseafter listening to me don't just dowhat I say, you have to be theultimate owner of your decision.I am just trying to help you makethat decision in a slightly better fashion.Sorry, I am making this in real-time.OkLet's do itAs you can see on the screen,we have created all these columnsaccording to the age profiles,so you could be less than 20 which means...So you could be less than 20, which means,you have not yet started working,you are still studying.There's 20-30, which means,you have finished your studiesand doing your first job of freelancingor something else.30-40, which means you have a family,you are slightly stable in your career.And then 40 plus, which means yourkids have grown up if you have kids,and your planning for retirement,so on and so forth.And that is going to be usedas a proxy for risk.As I said, the risk is increasingfrom bottom to above, and yourquantum is increasing from left to right,so that is what we will be takinginto account to evaluatethe pyramid way of investing.If you are less than 20, then mysuggestion would be, you shouldinvest 10% of the investment in Crypto,20% in US Stocks,30% in Indian direct stocks,40% in Index Mutual Fund,and 10% in gold.I will have to work on it.Let me work on this Aditya and Shivam.OkSo, so if you are less than 20,then my suggestion would be thatyou invest 20% of your investmentin Crypto because you can take that risk,but at the end of it, you will notinvest all of it in Crypto, which is amistake that a lot of people are doing.After that, invest around 30% in US stocksbecause that's a great market to be in.I use INDmoney or Vested,even you can use them.I use WazirX, CoinSwitch, and Vauld for Crypto,you can use any of them,all three are my preferences.20% indirect Indian stocks.You can use Zerodha for this,something that I have been usingfor the last four years.There are many Index Mutual Funds.I would recommend Mutual Fund by Navi.Invest 30% in it.And then, do not invest anywhere else.No fixed deposit, no gold,no corporate bonds, no EPF or PPFwhich is not even eligible for you,you shouldn't even do it, and of course,no real estate as of now.If you are in 20-30, then 10% in Crypto,so you will reduce your exposure toCrypto because it is risky overall,and your size also would have increasedbecause you would be investingmore amount in 20-30.About 20% in US stocks.30% in direct.30% in the Index Mutual Funds.You can go for 10% in digital goldbecause it helps over a long period,and it has grown over the last 30 yearsat about 14% CAGR, which is impressive.If you are in 31-40, then yourresponsibilities have increased,so you have to take lesser risks,you will have to go for a morestable income, so only 5% in Crypto,10% in US stocks, 20% in direct,30% in the index, the index will alwaysbe there because it is the safestbet that you want to take,5% in gold, so you will reduce that,and then you will have 10% in your EPF or PPF.So whatever corpus you would have,that should now be 10% ofyour total net worth.And then for the first time,you will start making real estateinvestments which can be 20% of yournet worth, and that is somethingthat I would recommend.If you are 40 plus, don't investin Crypto, too risky for you,unless you have a lot of money,but I would strongly suggestthat you don't make this mistake.Not even in US stocks.Not even in direct stocks.You will invest 40% in the indexbecause that is going to be less riskyof the highest risk asset which is stocks.And then 10% in gold.You can invest 10% in a fixed deposit.Why?Because you are saving on a corpusand ensuring that its inflation-adjustedamount remains as it is, so you havenow got into the mode of not justgrowing your money, but also savingor protecting your money.But that is only once you havereached the age of 40.Then, 10% in EPF and around 30% in real estatewhich could be your own houseor something which you buy for the yield.This for me is the pyramid wayof looking at investing.Understanding the risk profileof each and everything, understandingthe quantum of everything,and then investing accordingto your risk profile, which is20, 20-30, 30-40, or 40 plus.Now I will give you my example.My investing is not according to40 plus because I am able to takea lot of risks, I want to takea lot of risks, so my risk profileright now is actually closerto the 20-30 profile.I have invested about 10% in my Crypto,my investment in US stocks isnot even 20%, it's closer to 40%.My direct Indian stocks are far lesser.I have not invested in the index,I have invested in Smallcase,which is again a portfolio.I have invested very little in gold.Zero in corporate bonds.Zero in fixed deposit.Zero in EPF for PPF.Zero in real estate, very negligible.Of course, I have my own house,but I don't consider it as aninvestment because I am not goingto sell this house. This house willremain as it is because we havebought this house for ourselves.This is how I would approach any investing standard...This is how I would approachany investing decision.What is your risk?Understanding the risk in each asset,and what is the minimum quantumrequired to invest in each assetfor you to figure out what's workingand what isn't.I hope this was useful.Please do not forget to ask if youhave any doubts, any questions,or need any clarifications.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
