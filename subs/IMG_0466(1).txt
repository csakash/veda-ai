Do our parents not know how to take gifts?As soon as someone gives a gift, they say,what was the need for this?When have we asked for something?Has the money gone over your head?Do you have too much?Be happy and accept the gift with a smile.But no!But the problem will not end here.After that,How much is it?What difference does it make to you?!No!How much is it?Recently, on Diwali,I gave a gift of â¹5,000 to my parents,but my soul trembled,if I tell them it was for â¹5,000,who knows what will happen,so I said that it was for â¹1,500,bought it in sale.I am 40 years old, I have two children,I am still lying,this will go on for life my friend,and will never end.
