There are daily records,which I can see in different views,so itâs a really nice app for me to keeptrack of all the business that Iâm doingwhen it comes to my courses.Through this, in coursesâ¦I will say this looking at the screenIn this dimension, I regularly spend for coursesâ¦In the same category, I spend regularlyfor courses on Google and on Facebook.So, 2 apps for Google ads and Facebook ads,that help me track all the campaignsthat Iâm running at any point of time.So, as you can see, in Google ads,it gives me a very clear viewSo, as you can see, in Google ads,it gives me a very very clear viewof how my money is being spent.How many clicks have been there?How many impressions?What was the CTR, which meanshow many people clicked on that ad?What was the average CPC or Cost Per Click?So on and so forth.So, this gives me a great way to keep on trackmy spends when it comes to Google ads.The same ads run on YouTube, Google search,Google manager, so on and so forth.The second one is Facebook.So, I track all my ads on Facebook and Instagramthrough this Facebook ads app.And again it is,So, I track all my ads on Facebook and Instagramthrough this Facebook ads app.It again gives me all the campaignsthat Iâm running. At any point, I can seehow much money I have spent andhow is it doing? So usually, I look at yesterday,so how did I spend yesterday and how many peopledid I reach out to because of that?How many impressions?How many comments?How many shares and likes?How many clicks? So on and so forth.So, it gives me the entire funnel that I needto know to keep track of my spends.This was about earning money.They are actually not to earn money,but you get the drift. They are to trackwhatever we will earn after spending.Now, once the money has come in,a lot of my apps are around investing.There are different apps for differentasset classes, and I will shareall of them with you now.First and foremost, my first love, Smallcase.I have spoken a lot about Smallcase.To me it is my default investing app,because whenever I have some lump sumor a SIP, my first absolute focus goes to Smallcasebecause it gives me everything that I want.So, through Smallcase I can discoverall the smallcases that are there.I have shared with you many times,if you are starting your journey thenâAll weather investingâ is a great smallcaseto invest in. it is a bit expensive. If you wanta cheaper version then âEquity and goldâis a great and a relatively cheap smallcase.If you can spend more thenâValue and momentumâ is a greatsmallcase for any starter, because it givesyou a good return plus there is not much of a risk.I personally use 2 smallcases,I personally use 2 smallcases, one isâMomentumâ smallcase by weekly investingand second is by Capital MindI personally use 2 smallcases, one isMomentum Smallcase by Weekly Investingand second is Momentum Investingby Capital Mind. These are where bulkof my Smallcase investments are.An app that I absolutely love.I visit it everyday just for a feel,but itâs not a good sign. I would notrecommend it. Visit it once a week oronce a month simply. Donât get hookedbecause then it can become really addictive.The other app that I use which I don't useas much but it is a great app, is Coinwhich is by the Zerodha family.You can invest in mutual funds in Coinand the best thing about Coin is, all thesewill be direct investments, which meansyou will not have to give away any feesto any broker or middle man.Your expense ratio would be the least.This is a great way for you to invest.As you can see, I have invested inParag Parikhâs Flexi Cap Mutual fund,again it is not a recommendation.Please do your own research and then take it.It is a really good performing mutual fundpersonally for me. So, all the details thatyou would need, you buy at any point of timewhatever quantity you want in whatever amount.Usually, it starts from â¹1000. You can take a SIP;so it will keep informing you.So, itâs a great great app for you to havethe cheapest way to invest in mutual funds.Let me log inWhenever I want to buy direct stocks,which means I donât want to buy a smallcaseor a mutual fund, I want to buya companyâs direct stock, for instance,Zomato or Reliance or TCS or Infosys,again these are not recommendations,then I use Kite, which is the stockâ¦then I use Kite, which is the stock broking appâ¦then I use Kite, which is the product byZerodha to buy and sell stocks.So, my Demat account is in Zerodhaand Kite is their product which allowsyou to buy and sell stocks.I made a full-blown tutorial on Kite,you can check that in the description below,which will give you a complete tutorialstep-by-step on how to use Kite.It is a great product, it is very intuitive,very simple, not complicated. You will getthe hang of it if you use it once and thebest thing is, it is seamlessly integratedwith your UPI or your bank account,so you have to transfer money to it,buy stock, you can withdraw wheneveryou want to, the money is transferredback to your bank account within 2-3 days.Everything is seamless,everything is secure and I love it.By the way, I use another app for securitywhich I want to talk to you about,but keep watching the video.If I want to invest international,which means largely US market,then I use 2 apps, one of which is now mypredominant app and that is Vested Finance.To invest in international markets,especially in the US, I use 2 apps,one of which I use predominantly,itâs called Vested.Vested app allows you to invest inany US stock and it does so in the cheapestmanner possible. I made a video on itlast week itself, I will encourage you to check.Lowest fee for the transfer ofyour money from India to US.Lowest fee for you to withdraw the moneyâ¦SorryLowest fee for you to transfer your money fromâ¦Lowest fee for you to transfer your moneyfrom India to US. Lowest feefor you to bring the money back into India.Great app! Very simple to use.Very powerful in terms of its research,its suggestions and everything.Oh God! Sorry man!Can you believe this!This is the call that I have beenspammingly getting for the last 3 times.Ridiculous man!Lowest transaction fee from transactionâ¦Itâs an absolutely free app.You donât have to pay anything to buyand sell stocks. The usually high fee totransfer money from India to US isconsiderably low in this. The amountof money you have to pay to get themoney back is also very low.Itâs aâ¦Iâll do this again.Itâs a completely free app.You donât have to pay anything to buyand sell stocks. The usually high fee totransfer money from India to US isconsiderably low in this. The money thatyou need to spend to bring back the moneyfrom Us to India is also very lowin terms of withdrawal fee.Great app to use! I love the product!Thatâs something that I use.The second product that I use is Indmoneybut I've changed the purpose of Indmoneyand I will come to it very soon.Then is Crypto. I do Crypto investingthrough 2 apps. One is India exchangewhich is WazirX that is my number one default.I made a whole series with WazirX onCrypto investing with Nischal Shetty whois the CEO and founder of WazirX.Little intimidating app but I like itbecause it is fairly secure. I like the factthat it is India's number 1 cryptocurrencyexchange, so there is a trust at some level.Plus Binance which is a global leader incryptocurrency exchanges, they are theones who own WazirX now, so there isa little bit of trust there as well.And if I want to in US,well actually there is no USor International in crypto,but if I want to use an international app,not an India exchange, then I use Binance.Binance is something which is also
very very powerful,very very secure. Global leader.Again very intuitive, you can do everythingvery easily. That is my second appwhen it comes to crypto.So, when it comes to investing all ofthese apps comprise my investing,whether it is smallcase, or mutual funds,or direct stocks, or crypto, or US investingand anything else that I have to do outside of...So when it comes to investing all of theseapps comprise my investing apps,whether it is investing in smallcases,in mutual funds, in direct stocks,in US market or in crypto.How do I track my money?To track my money, I use Indmoney whichis a great app, because it's an all in one app.All your mutual funds, stock investments,US investments, you can see all of thoseon one single screen. It gives you yournet worth and everything, so I love Indmoneyfor the fact that it gives you one view access plusyou can add your family as well which is brilliant.So, your parents, your spouse, whoever it is,you can just have a collective family view,of your net worth of all your investmentsand also of all your expenses.All my credit cards are also linked with Indmoneyand I can then have a clear access ofwhere my money is going, how much of it ismy net worth, and that is somethingthat I genuinely love to do.The second app which of course I use to trackmy money and you all know it is MS-Excel.Surprisingly I still use MS-Excel so many timesbecause it's a great app for me, not an appreally but a software, it's a great softwarefor me to do my ballpark calculations if Iwant to take any loan, or I am trying todetermine the return, the actual return ofan asset or an instrument, or anything else,or just keep record of something that I wantto remember. All of that is possible throughMS-Excel and I love love love love this software.To secure all these I use a third-party authenticatorwhich is the Google Authenticator.Some apps allow this authenticator.So basically, like there is in OTP,now OTP is a fixed number, right?So, if by mistake that OTP is leakedor you told somebody and they leak it,then your account can be compromised.With Google Authenticator, or for that matterany other authenticator, they have a dynamic OTP.So there is a 6-digit number, but it keepschanging after, I think every 30 seconds.So what you have to do, which is a littlecumbersome but I like it for my security,that if I want to login to Zerodha's Kiteor in Smallcase then I will have to open upthis app, look at the OTP which is givenat that time, and enter it and that ishow it allows me. So, because I have linkedmy account to this app, I am the only onewho can access this random and this dynamic OTP,no one else can, which makes my account secure.Nobody else can do anything with it.I am about to give a huge giveaway in thisvideo which will hopefully start yourinvesting journey or solidify it,whichever way you are...AgainI want to give a very special giveaway throughthis video which is something that I havenever done before. I am super excited,I hope you are too, to keep watching the video.And then finally, my payment apps.Which apps do I regularly use for my payments?First and foremost, for my default UPIor digital payments is Paytm. This is an appwhich has just been there forever and ever and ever.So, I just love the speed with which it pays,I love the security with which it comes,I love the fact that it has a very low failure rate,though it happens sometimes, but that iswith every app. So, this is my default go-to appfor any digital payment that I have to make,especially if it is UPI.Sometimes it happens that the personI want to make the payment to,they would want it on Google pay,then Google pay becomes my default appor a backup app to do the UPI paymentsand these are the two that I use for my UPI.For credit card, I have spoken about this activity,what I use is Cred. Cred in my opinion isthe fastest way to pay for credit card payments.I make my credit card payments very regularlyand that's why I use Cred. I am not ableto use its points so much. I have begunshopping on Cred and I like what they have,but I have a lot of points and there arevery few avenues to spend. I am hopingsomething comes up in the future but justfor the sake of payments, I love the product.And then finally, my banking partnerwhich is HDFC Bank. I am with HDFC Banksince 2004, it's been a 17-year association.All my loans are through HDFC,my credit cards are from HDFC,my bank is HDFC,my company's current account is from HDFC,so everything is HDFC, and that's whyI use the HDFC app very regularlybecause that is my way of just trackingwhatever is there in my bank.Not the best app experience, I wish they hadfocused a lot more on their IT, but you know what?This bank is so huge that they feel thateven if there are some errors thenalso we will survive, but that's how it is in India,can't help it.So, these were all my money apps that I use.As you will figure out, they are not very complicated.I am fairly sure, there was no app thatI mentioned and you haven't heard about it.So it is not that, I know somethingor I do something which is outside of what you know.Whatever I am doing, I am doing it with100% visibility that you can also get,100% transparency that you also have.It is just the discipline of doing that.The discipline of saying that there shouldbe one category where I am constantlymaking money outside of my salary.There should be a focus where I am investingmy money, whether it is in mutual funds,whether it is in Smallcase, whether it is indirect stocks, whether it is in US stocks,whether it is in crypto, or a combination thereof.It should be secure so that I am never at risk.And then I have the ease of tracking this moneythrough any app that I have and the easeof making payments whenever I have to.You bring all of this together, you havea nice happy machinery where throughyour smartphone, you can basically just moveyour money across the world in seconds.Now in this video I want to
give a very special giveaway.I want to give you all a stock and not a stockthat I want to give but a stock that you want.So you have to now commentin the comment section below.Any stock,mind you whether that stock isexpensive or cheap, I want you to namethe stock that you want me to gift to you,with a reason, why do you wantthe stock of that company?My condition of gifting it to you wouldonly increase with how solid is your reason.I will be giving away 3 stocks which willbe purely decided on the basis ofhow powerful is your reason forwhy you want that stock?
