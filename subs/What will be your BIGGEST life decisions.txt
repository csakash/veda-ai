Check 1, 2. Check 1, 2.What do we order fromZomato and Swiggy today?Do we wear a black t-shirtor the blue one?Do we go to 'that' restaurant ordo we go to the one againwhere we get nice Dal Makhani?What do we watch on Netflix today?We take so many decisionsin our life, right?Every day,every second.Some or the other decisionkeeps going on in our mind -whether we are taking it activelyor passively.And it seems like when weare taking that decision,it is our life's,at that point,is the most important decision.But let metake a step backand ask you -'In your life,what will be the most important decisionand have you already taken itor not?' The most important decision.And it becomesa striking question to askthat what would be our life'smost important decision?Will it be related to career?Or will it be related to relationship?Or will it be related to family?Or will it regarding ourselves?And suddenly,you start thinkingthat there are so many such decisions.Every decision is seeming important,at that point of time atleastit definitely does.Zomato, Swiggywas also looking important.How does one go about figuringthat in lifewhich are the most impactful,most important decisions?This is somethingthat I realizedin January of this year.In January this year,I had gone to Australiato meet a very dear friend, Gitanjali.Gitanjali is a marketing professorat Sydney Business School,and,in our conversationsshe mentioned about acolleague of hers -Adrian Camilleri.I hope I am pronouncing it.Adrian Camilleri. I hopeI am pronoucing their namecorrectly. Adrianis definitely the right pronounciation,the last name might not be.AdrianAdrian is an associateprofessor of marketing,in the same business schoolwhere Gitanjali teaches as well, butthey have done a veryinteresting researchon 'life's biggest decisions'.And they havedone a very interesting research.And they have done a very interestingresearch on 'biggest life decisions',which theyrightfully call 'BiggestLife Decisions Project'as its name.In this, they concluded,after speaking to thousands of people,what are thebiggest life decisionsthat people end uptaking in one's life.And then, he broke it down further,that how we can take those decisionsin the right manner,how many decisionswe take at what times in our entirelife, and,what are the regretsthat many peopleare often left with?In this video, I willshare all those things with you,in my understandingof the BiggestLife Decisions Projectby Professor Adrian.Adrian.In this video, I want toshare all those thingsthat I have myself learnt fromthe Biggest Life DecisionsProject by ProfessorAdrian with all of you.First of all, let's go through thelist of all of these decisions whichAdrian concluded are the biggestlife decisions, more or less.There are multiple categories, 9 in all,and each category hassub-questions. The very first category -Career.In career,there are fewobvious life decisions.1. Should you start anew job or a new positionor should you stop it?So should you start a new jobor a position, or should you quita job or a position?2. Should you start a businessor not, or should you close itor not?3. Should you retire or not,or you should not retire?Of course, there are many other,because this is an international study,there was one more careerrelated question thatshould you join themilitary or not, whichthankfully is not aimposed decision in our countrybut can be a choicefor people to go to, and thatalso then becomespart of a sub-questionin the career category.Then the second category -Education.Should you pursue a degree,or not?Choosing a placeto study - it can be an instituteor a place or a country as well.And then choosing a major ora specialization -what will you study in?These are the 3 most important decisionswhen it comes to education.Number 3 category - Family,this is when it becomes interesting.Number 1 -1. Should you have achild or adopt a childor not?2. Should you end a lifeor not? And this islargely in the realm ofabortion.3. Should you make a decisionfor your childor not?4. Should you carefor a family memberor not?5. Should you have afamily member move inor not?6. Should you get a pet or not?7. Should you put down a petor not? Basically,give themdeath.Category number 4 -Finances.Should you buy a homeor not?My favourite question!Should you sell a homeor not?Should you buy something,a product, a service oran experience, or not?Should you sell something,or not?Should you create a plan or a budget,or not?Should you make investmentsor not?Should you make a willor not?Number 5 -Relationships.This, in myopinion was the most interesting.Should you begin a non-romanticrelationship or not? Which we oftencall friendship.Should you enda non-romantic relationship or not?Should you begin a romanticrelationship or not?Should you enda romantic relationship or not?Should you get marriedor not?Should you get divorcedor not?Should you engage in sexual activityor not?Should you disclose secret informationor not?When you start thinking,each question is so important, right?Each question, at some pointor the other in our life,stands before us.And to take thatdecision in that moment,is whatAnd to takethat decision in that moment,could materiallychange our entire lifegets up to me. That's why'the biggest life questions'.Category number 6 - Relocation.Should you move to a newplace in the same cityor not?Should you move to a new cityor not?Should you move to a new stateor not?Should you move to a new countryor not? And of course,if this project continues thenthanks to Elon Musk, should youmove to a new planetor not?Category number 7 -Self-destruction,and this is a very important category. Why?I will tell you later in this video.1. Should you commit a crimeor not?Should you self-harmor not?Should you startan addiction,or not?And then finally,And then finally,Category number 8 - Self-development.Should you acceptor change your sexualityor not?Should you quitaddiction or not?Should you travel,or take a holiday,or not?Should you pursue a religion,or pursue spirituality,or not?Should you pursuea philosophy or an idealogy?Should you change yourphysical appearanceor not?Should you get treatment, medicine,or not?Should you engage in anew hobby or a sport,or not?Should you learn a new skillor not?These are the 8 categoriesand all the questionsin the categories, whichaccording to Professor Adrian,are the most importantdecisions in our life.Now, among these,these were manythese were many decisions,and,immediately,Now these are many decisions, soimmediately a question arises -all these decisionswere seeming important itself,and this could be concluded by anyone.Which ones are the mostimportant out of these?And the answer for this as wellhas been given byProfessor Adrian in his research study.Now, the way that it is done isthat all this is done through a survey,like even I had filled a survey,which is linked in the pinned commentand description.So even you canfill the survey, which isthat what do you think are your life'stop important decisions?It is not necessarythat you have already taken those.It can be for the future as well.And you answer a bunch of questionsaround that, and with thatan emerging study is done.And with that, an emergingdata comes up, which tells us which,according to people,are the most important life decisions,whether they have taken it,or not.So let's focus on thecategories firstly.Conclusively, the most importantConclusively the mostimportant influence ofConclusively,data suggeststhat career,education,family, finances,relationship -this, in order,are the top 5 categorieswhich define the most importantdecisions of our life.The first one -Career.Number 2. Education. Number 3. Family.Number 4. Finances. And number 5.Relationships.And then comes relocation,self-destruction, self-development,and something else.So you will see thatthese decisions, which were incareer, education, family,finances,relationship,are our life's most importantdecisions.Now, let's look at the sub-categories.In these sub-categories,very interestingly,this is global data, not necessary thatthis is India-specific.So global data tells that the mostimportant, or the mostmeaningful decisionof our life is -whether we pursue a philosophy oran idealogy or not.I would actually agreebecause at the end of itthe way you live your life, your nature,every person's way oflooking at life, at people,looks at life and decisions,that philosophy, that idealogy,defines almost everything.If you have a growth mindset,if you are an optimist, then you willlook at life in a particular way.If you have a fixed mindset,or you are a pessimist,then you will look at lifein a different manner.So the philosophy, the idealogywhich you have towards lifebecomes perhaps, the mostimportant decision thatyou make in life, because thatin some way,determines everything else.Number 2, surprisingly,it was surprising for me,whether you pursue a religionor spirituality or not.I do not consider myself religious,not sure if I am spiritual or notbecause I don't exactly knowwhat this is.So, I was most surprised by that, butthere are people, there is data,then of course it must be rightthat people saygoing on one religion or spiritualitypath or notis life's most important decisionat number 2.Number 3 - whether to retire or not?And this is obvious, becauseat what point do you retire,or if you retire at allor not, this determines so much -yourthe importance of work in your life,or its importance reducingor to be able to spend time with peopleor not - all these thingsare dependent on this decision that youthink about retiring or not,when do you think,or not.Number 4 - Buy a home. Thisis such an important decision,which is why I keep saying it.Whether you buy a house or notbecomes such animportant life decision becausethis will beone of the biggest, if not the biggest expense of your life.If you have taken thisvery early in life,then you can trap yourself in a clutch,where you haveexceeded your budget,you have been locked inan EMI for 20-25 years,now you cannot change your house,city, country,so you have become immobile as well,then the cost to maintainthat house exists as well,suppose that houseseems small also, to expandthere will be an additional cost,so there are many things which if youtake this decision early in life,then you cannot move.But, if this decision itself,you take after some time,or rather after a lot of time,like,at the age of 39,I bought our first house.That, thengives you that freedomthat till then youstay in a rented house,in astay in a rented house,explore, keep yourself mobile,and when a balance has been achieved,that family has been fixed,the country has been fixed,the city has been fixed,the budget has been fixed, now you canmake that commitment,hopefully for the rest of your life.You go ahead and do that.So at number 4,buying a homeis one of the most importantlife decisions.At number 5 - start a new business.It is Shark Tank's world these days,every person wants tostart their businessat some point or the other,but the decisionto do that or notis such an important oneand when doyou do that is also important.So this, at number 5,is the most important life decisionaccording to the data.Number 6 -may not be so much in India,but I think it is certainlyglobally, and maybeit is in our country as well,but we do not talk about this openly -do you acceptor change your sexualityor not?This is an importantform of self-expression, and of course,a way of existence andliving, so, many people,with this,define one of their life decisionand their way to live life,which is understandable and naturalbecause you don'tget to chooseyour sexuality, you get to onlydisplay it, express it,feel it, and that is somethingthat we should allow everyoneand at the same time, becomessuch a meaningful partof somebody's life.Next, engage in sexual activity, or not?So, many people said thatat the 8th number,this is the 8th most importantlife decision for them.Now this could beoutside of marriage,without marriage,within a marriage.All of these permutations are therebut the fact that youwill engage in a sexual activity or notis, according to people,a very important life decision.And then comesthe important ones -begin an addiction,commit crimeand self-harm.These threeare considered to be veryimportant life decisionsand it has also shownhas proven toresult in themost negative outcome.Whenever peoplehave started an addiction,committed a crime,or self-harm,suicide,hurting yourself physically,mentally,being aware that you're doing that,engaged in all these activities,people have said it hasbeen an important life decision,and a lot more people have said it hasalmost always resultedin a negative outcomefor our life,which clearly showsthat these 3 thingscould lead tonegative outcomes,something that we shouldalways be mindful of,something we should alwaysbe prepared for.Now, let's discuss one hopeful thing.The hopeful thing isthat you would be feeling thatall these life decisionswould endby 30 years of age.Which means, if before 30 yearsthese decisions are taken,then life is set. If they are not taken,then there can be trouble.What the data suggestsis completely opposite.Yes, almost 20%-30% ofthe important life decisionsare madebetweenOnly about 20%-30%of all the important lifedecisions, people claimthat they are takenbefore 25 years of age.In fact, after 30 years,people say thatclose to 60% of your decisionswhich impactData suggests thatbefore 30 years,out of all of your life'simportant decisions,you should take only 20%-30% of those.You should take the restof them after 30 years of age.And that, should give you hope.Because if you think thatin 22-24 years of age,you haven't been able to solve life,it's because you are part of thecrowd my friend,you are not alone.Every person is in the same boat,in the same ocean,is touring the same river.You don't have to be scared.Life is very long,many important decisionsare yet to be taken,and to take all those decisions,the right time will come, and whenit comes, you will take those decisions.In fact, data suggests thathowever old you might be,you might be 40, 50, 60,every time, whatever is the responsibility,a respondent was telling,that there are few decisions which Ihave taken recentlyand they have still beenjust as important.When I took this survey,I realized that 60%of mylife decisions whichI think are important,I have taken in the last 10 yearsbetween the age of 32to 42. 60%and this is true in reality.Whether it was decidingthat we should have kids,it was decidingthat I should leave this job, it wasdecided that I should start this job,it was decidedthat we shouldbuy a new house, it was decided thatwe should move out of our parents' house.All these, in my life,have been very important decisions for meand 60% of themhave come in the last 10 years. Thatis what data is suggesting,that is what I personally experienced,and I cannot be happier.to tell you thisbecause if you think thatif you do not settle in 20s,then life won't be settled,it's a lie.Explore in 20s,take few life decisions,the rest,leave it on life.And finally,while taking these decisions,in the endthere are few people,when they reflect on their lifeand ask themselves thatwhich were those'I wish' moments?I wishI had done this, I wish I had done that.What were the topregretsthat people had?For this,Professor Adrian did a very beautifulstudy, actually it was an experienceon which a book was written'The Top 5 Regrets ofthe Dying'.And this was a nurseBronnieThere was a nurse named Bronnie Ware.Since she used to work in a hospitalwhere she would take care of elders,a lot of them were on their death bed,so while conversing with them,she realised that thesewere the recurringtop 5 regretsof the dying.1. I wish I had the courageto live a lifetrue to myself,not the lifeothers expected of me.I wish I had the courage that Iwould live my life on my own termsand not on what people expected from me.Such an important regret,such a devastating regret.This was number one. Number 2 -I wish I hadn't worked so hard.And this is not aboutthat I wish I had not worked this hard.I wishI had not given my timeso much importance.Because at the end of it,I realized that it was just work.I wish I had not givenso much importance to my work.Because at the end of it,I realised that it is just work.And I am a dispensableasset for the company -layoff anytime, promote anytime, praise anytime,insult anytime.But for me,I used to think this is my whole life.But my work did not turnout to be my whole life.My life is way bigger than that and I wishI had not given as muchimportance to my workas Ias much as I ultimately gave.Number 3 - I wish I hadthe courage to express my feelings.I wish I had enough couragethat whatever was in my mind,I could express it.So many times we are unable to expresswhat is in our mind.Because of fear,because wemight not be accepted,because we might be embarassed,we shiver because ofthe fear of rejection.So manyuncountable,experiences and emotions that stop usto express our feelings.And people who were dyingsaid 'I wishI had the courage to express my feelings'.Number 4 - I wish I  had stayed intouch with my friends. I wishI was able tomaintain the same friendship whichI wanted,but it could not happen. Number 5 -I wish I had let myself behappier.I wishI couldmake myself happier,see myself happier,be happier.These were the top 5 regrets.So all these life lessonsseem to be many.What you have to dothrough this video issit down with yourself,take the survey by the way,and figure out that which would bethe 10 most important decisions of your life.And make those decisionsyour most important objective.Every small thing,every small decisionin which we get stuck,where you feel thatwhat if this decisionis not taken correctly,what might happen, what might not happen,all of that is noise.These 10 decisions,if in your life,you take correctly,you will live your life withleast number of regrets.Maximum happiness.And would have learntfrom someonewho did their hardwork for you.I am glad through Gitanjali and this vacation,I got to know about a new study,a new concept,which I have shared with all of youand I hope ithelped you all as well.Ankur Warikoo,signing off.
