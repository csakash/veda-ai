Alright check 1 2 check 1 2If you invest in the stock marketthrough smallcase...If you invest in the stock marketthrough Smallcase then what areits associated charges,we will get to know in this video.Friends, if you follow me then youwould know that I do all of mystock market investing through Smallcase.I do buy some direct company stocks,but largely I invest ina portfolio of stocks.I have made many videos on Smallcase,about why I use it,what is a purpose of rebalance in it,so on and so forth.In this video, I will specificallytalk to you about the chargesassociated with Smallcasebecause many people who watched my videoand started using Smallcase, said'We started using Smallcase,invested around â¹4-5000and all the money was gone.We received some kind ofan expense, a bill. Can you tell uswhat are the charges of using Smallcase,how is it charged and why?'And in this video, I will covereach of these things.Basically, let's start witha small introduction about Smallcase.What is Smallcase?Smallcase is a portfolio of stocksthat represents an idea or a themeor an investing strategy.Like if you want to buy acompany's stock then you will haveto do a lot of research to knowthe company's financials,its revenue growth, its PnL,its balance sheet, maybe youare equipped maybe you are not,maybe you have the time maybe you do not.I do not have that expertiseor even the time so I rely on experts.And a medium to rely on experts is Smallcase.There are many experts in Smallcasewho treat investment in terms ofa portfolio so they will decide themesand you bet on those themes.For example, recently a very goodSmallcase has come calledThe House of Tata.If you are tracking the stocksof all the group companies of Tata,then you obviously know that thestock of each and every companyis performing great.It's actually a great thing if you areinvested in portfolio companies of Tata,whether it's TCS...Whether it's TCS, or Tata steel,or Tata Elxsi, so on and so forth,so there is enough and more momentumin the Tata stocks.And suppose you want to bet on it,then you have to buy the stocksof each and every company,you wouldn't know in what ratioshould you buy them because therisk profile of every company is different,so the risk to be taken to generatemaximum results isa mathematical exercise,someone is doing all that work for you,so if you take the Smallcase ofHouse of Tata, then it gives youa predetermined ratio or weightof each Tata Company stock,it tells you how much to buy,when to buy, how much to sell,when to sell, and through one clickyou can get this entire thing done,that is what I love about Smallcase.The best thing beyond this is,all these transactions are donethrough my Demat account.So I have 100% control.When do I want to exit?How much do I want to buy?Whether I want to buy or not?All of those decisionsare mine to take.I am using Smallcase only for advice,but through my Demat account,whether it is Zerodha, or 5paisa,or HDFC securities, wherever,I will execute it throughmy Demat account using Smallcase,all the integrations are established.I personally use Zerodha,and my Smallcase and Zerodha connected.That is the power of Smallcase.Now, if you do not know about Smallcases,then this introduction wouldbe enough, there are somemore videos, please watch them.Assuming that you know about Smallcase,let's get to know what are the charges?There are specifically three charges.First of all, a transaction chargeby Smallcase itself, which means,whenever you subscribe to Smallcase,or use it, or sign up for it,then you have to pay a subscriptionamount or a transaction fee.I will tell you how much that is.Second, which is more important,are the brokerage chargesor Demat account charges.The charges of every brokerageor Demat account are different.I will tell you about Zerodhabecause I know thatand I used it personally.And third, which many of youhave observed, are some ofthe Smallcases which were free earlier,are now paid.This means, the research that earlieryou were getting for free, is now paid,so what are the charges to circumventthis and how to take note of it?First of all...First of all, let's start withthe transaction charges of Smallcase.Let's go to LoomAs you can see on the screen,for all small cases, each and everySmallcase, a one-time feeof â¹100 plus GST, which is â¹118is charged on the day of the purchase.So whether that Smallcase is free or paid,in whatever form that Smallcase may be,when you make the first transactionthrough Smallcase in your Demat account,â¹118 will be deducted.This is irrespective of the Smallcase type,it is important to know this.If you are investing less than â¹4000,then 2.5% of whatever you investedwill be charged.If you have invested â¹1000,and you can invest â¹1000 in Smallcaseon the first day, then you will becharged 2.5%, which means â¹25 plus GST,not â¹100.So above â¹4000, it is a flat feeof â¹100 plus GST which is â¹118,below 4000, it is 2.5% plus GST.This is the only charge youhave to pay to Smallcase.I will repeat it,because many people thinkthat Smallcase is expensive.No, no this is the only waySmallcase makes money.A third way, the third costof subscription which I mentioned earlier,is very different becausethere are many free Smallcases.For example, the best Smallcaseto start with is calledAll Weather Investing.It is a great mix of equity, gold,as well as debt.So it will give you a stable return,it will not be a high returnbut the risk or the volatilitywill be very stable.So, if you are someone who doesn'tlike a lot of risks,and you don't want that yourmoney should fluctuate rapidly,then All Weather Investingis a great Smallcase to start.Personally, I also started with that,but now, of course, I have moved onto other small cases which come withhigher volatility and high returns.All Weather Investing is a free small case,so if you use it...All Weather Investing is a free Smallcase,starting as low as â¹3458,which means you can start with â¹3500.This is a one-time payment.If you want to do SIP,you can do that as well.But to do this, you have to payâ¹118 only once on the day youused or execute it, assuming thatyou are investing more than â¹4000.That's it! There are no other chargesafter that, but that brings usto the 2nd point, where do the expensesactually occur, which we do not know ofor do not go noticed.And those are the charges that arecharged by the brokerage accountor Demat account. This is what youcan see on Zerodha. Zerodha isa free brokerage company,so you don't have to pay any brokerageto Zerodha as long as you aren'tselling the stock on thesame day of purchase.So whenever you buy a stock fordelivery which means you want to hold it,Zerodha won't charge you anything,this is Zerodha's charge.But above that, there are certaincharges which you have to pay asare levied by the exchange,NSDL so on and so forth,and let's talk about that.The first one, exchange turnover fees.This is the turnover fees of the exchange.I just repeated exactlythe same thing, how silly of me.Which is 0.00325% of the traded value,this means that if you trade stocks ofvalue â¹1000 then you will have topay 0.00325%, in this case,which would be â¹3,â¹3 right? No... wait.So, if you traded for â¹1000 then youwill have to pay 0.00325% asexchange turnover fees,which will come to â¹0.0325,which is a very low amount.Of course on a bigger amount itlooks very big, so if youtrade â¹1 lakh, then yourexchange turnover fees will be â¹3.25,which of course, you may stillnot notice because it is onlyâ¹3.25, but â¹3.25 will becharged to you.The 2nd thing is GST on thisturnover fee, which is,if you have traded for â¹1 lakhand the exchange turnover feeis â¹3.25, then 18% GST willbe levied on it.After that comes thesecurities transaction tax.Now, this becomes heavy,0.1% of the traded value.Actually, let's play Excel Excel,because that will help.So let's assume that you...So let's assume that you aretrading for â¹10,000,so first, we will calculate theexchange turnover fees whichis 0.00325%, so this is your ETF,that is this into this. Ok?Then comes your STT,and STT is 0.1%, and that meansyou will be charged â¹10 for that.Then comes your stamp duty,and this stamp duty varies,but let us assume that it willbe 0.1%, so â¹1 will be charged for it.Then comes your Sebi chargeswhich are 0.0002%,and Sebi charges 0.0002%,some paise will be charged,and then comes Demat charges per stock,this is something peopledo not know of a lot, though theydon't know most of theother things also,but this is the biggestchunk of expense. Whenever you sellany stock, on the day yousell the stock, then CDSL or NSDL,which are the 2 depositorieswhere your stocks are actuallymaintained in India, you haveto pay â¹13.5 or â¹12.5 plus GST.Now, this is a function of thenumber of unique stocks you are selling.Nothing will be charged whenyou buy them, but the day youwould want to sell them,you will have to pay these charges.So whenever you exit or rebalancea Smallcase, you buy and sellin rebalance, I have coveredthis entire process in a video,you can check that out, this iswhen you have will have to paythose charges.This is what bugs the most.For example, if you have tradedfor â¹10,000, and if you bought 5 stocks,then you will have to pay â¹13.5into 1.18, which is â¹15.93,and this will be the charge.So, if add all these, then youwill see that for this purchaseof â¹10,000, you were charged â¹91.Now, this is not a Smallcase charge.This is the charge by Demat,exchange, Sebi, and many more,through which they earn and exist.But this is what you have to payfor every time you make that.Now, everything is fixed in thisexcept the number of stocks.If the number of stocks here is 10,then you will be charged â¹170.If you would sell only 2 stocks,then you will be charged only â¹43.So, you can see that everythingis the percentage of traded volume,but the cost by NSDL and CDSLis per stock sold, which is why it isimportant for you to know that.This is the second charge.The third charge is what is actuallythe subscription amount for Smallcase.As I have said earlier,I have invested in 2 Smallcases.The first one is Capital Mind Momentum.It invests in momentum strategy,which means, there is a momentum strategyin stock investing which sayswhen a stock is rising, it keeps risingfor a few days before it starts falling,there is a certain momentum.So, it bets on that small periodwhen it is on a rise, which naturallymeans that these bets or thesestocks change very quickly,it also means it is high volatilitybecause if something is going down,it keeps going down before it startsrising again. So, it is high volatility,but that is something thatI am personally comfortable with.If you look at its 3-year return,it is 62%, which is crazy, so naturally,there is of course a lot that youwill get but it will havehigh volatility coming in.I have no idea why is it showinglow volatility on the screen.The other one is Momentumby Weekend Investing.It is closed now but a greatreplacement for that is NLF10 Momentum.This is a Smallcase of Weekend Investing,which is run by Alok Jain,very very good Smallcase, againvery high returns, 57% returnin one year, fairly high volatility.This also invests on momentum strategybut what you will see is thatthese are paid.So for instance, the momentum strategyis â¹2,500 for 3 monthsand â¹7,400 for 12 months.This is the amount over and abovethe charges that I told you about.So, Smallcase will still chargeyou â¹100 if you use this forthe first time. You will payall the charges we saw on the excel sheetfor whatever amount you invest.Over and above that, you will paythis Smallcase creator, in this case,Weekend Investing, â¹2,500 for 3 months,for the research that they are doing for you.This is money that has to be accountedfor when you calculate the actual return,because your actual return should beevaluated after deducting the chargesby Smallcase, brokerage,and your subscription.Of course, there will be tax also,long-term, or short-term capital gain tax,so the net adjusted return is youractual return, which is the actual amountthat you get after everything,so this one is paid.Capital Mind charges â¹4,000 for 3 months,â¹12,000 for 12 months, this is also paid.And there is something which is there...And then there are a lot ofgood Smallcases which are now paid.For example, Straight Flush,which is a very very good Smallcase.It charges â¹2,000 for 3 months.Value and Momentum, which I really like,if you are starting investor,you do not have a lot of moneybut you are ready to take some risk,then Value and Momentum isa very very good Smallcase to invest in.Personally, I also invested inValue and Momentum afterAll Weather Investing.That is how I got to know aboutmomentum, and after that,I bought Smallcases ofCapital Mind and Weekend Investing.This again is â¹2000 per month.Then if you go to Brand Value,which is companies that are reallygood brands in India, you are buyingthose stocks, which is alsofor â¹2000 for 3 months.If you Low-Risk Smart Beta,I made a dedicated video onAlpha and Beta, please check it out.Low Beta or Smart Beta meansyou are buying a stock thatperforms better than thevolatility in the market.So when the market is very low,then it doesn't go down that much,when the market rises a lot,then it doesn't rise that much,which gives you somewhat ofa stable return, and that iscalled Smart Beta or Low Beta.So, this one charges â¹2000.So, if you start buying allthese Smallcases, then yourmoney would vanish, and thatis why there is somethingthat Smallcase has introduced,which I love, and it's calledthe Windmill Capital Subscription.I have personally taken this.Windmill is one of the biggestcreators of Smallcases on Smallcase,and Windmill Capital is a Sebiauthorized and registered entity,they generate these Smallcases.So, what they have done is,for â¹2000 per 3 months or â¹6000for the entire year, all thepaid Smallcases of Windmill,all of them will be availablefor you, absolutely no additional cost,which means you don't have tobuy individual smallcases,you can take one subscription plan ,and all the paid Smallcases underWindmill Capital will be availableto you for free. In addition to that,if any other new paid Smallcaseis introduced during yoursubscription period, that wouldalso be free for you.This means, as long as you area subscriber, everything foryou is free, all Smallcasesby Windmill Capital are freefor you, and that is great because,Value and Momentum,Dividend Stars, which is a greatSmallcase of dividend-paying stocks,Straight Flush, as I showed you,Brand Value,Low Risk smart Beta,all these paid Smallcases will befree for you through this subscription.Of course, there are a lot offree Smallcases, so as you can see,ETFs, All Weather Investing,I spoke about this.Top 250 Stocks, I spoke about this.Thematic, there are several good themes,like a theme of Great Indian Middle-Class,the brands in which themiddle-class usually indulges.There is Rising Rural Demand,the brands which have rural Indiaas its consumers, and based on that,you bet on these companies.Trackers, which I spoke about.House of Bajaj,House of Tata,all of these are really good.And then there are a few fee-basedSmallcases that come free for youif you buy the subscription.Now, it is very difficult to trackall of these, so I work very closelywith the Smallcase team, becausepersonally I really like this product,and I was trying to get them to workon something which will ensurethat it is very clearly visibleto the consumer that what arethe costs that they are bearingwhenever they go through a Smallcase,and I'm so glad to announce thatnow this thing has been released.On the screen...On the screen, you can seehow it can actually be used.So, Shalabh has sent me this,who is my counterpart at Smallcase,I personally also use this.If you are looking at any Smallcaseon the Smallcase app, then youcan see the returns,but most importantly, below that,there is a cost weighted return as well,so cost adjusted return meansthat you can put in your amount,and based on that amount, whateveryour expense would be to actuallyexecute this Smallcase, it will deductall that and generate a return for you,and that is what you can see on thescreen when you use the Smallcase app.So, unadjusted, whatever is the amount,and cost adjusted, of course,the amount would be lower but nowyou have 100% transparency to seethat happen, whether you want tosee the return of 5 years, or 1 year,or 3 years, all of that is there.If you want more details at any pointthen you can click on 'i', which is againthose charges, and you will be ableto see all the charges thatwe discussed today.Regulatory charges, which are Brokerage,STT, all of that, plus theSmallcase charges that are there.This then makes it super super easy.It still doesn't include thesubscription amount, which we spoke about.It is over and above that.but at least the Smallcase chargesand the regulatory chargesare completely covered.Now you shouldn't have any confusionabout how much does Smallcase charges,because so far it was slightly complicatedto figure this out.After all of these changes,and hopefully, through this video,everything would be absolutely clear.If you have any more questions,discussions, comments on Smallcase,please do not forget to ask me.A new video every Tuesday, Thursday,and Saturday at 9:30 pm.Don't forget to subscribe so thatget notified when videos are released.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
