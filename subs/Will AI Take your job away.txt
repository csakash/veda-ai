ï»¿Okay Piyush.This is a very exciting video.And in this video,you have to bring a different Piyush.Not to suggest that,the Piyush we have is not good.But you have to have super fun with this.An inspiration for that is,the NFT video made by Aditya,So, I will try to help you.By making it look like very fast,very rapid, and so on.But you have to bring ina lot of excitementaround animation, around visual effects,around whatever supers are coming,music of course, so on.Don't give the suggestion for 1.5x.The video itself will try to make it fast.And many things will be going on.Loom etc. would also be running.I'll bring in Loom.Loom etc. would also be running.So, I...will try and make this...As good as possible. All right.Cool. All right, let's get started.Recording. Oh, hi cool.So we will start Piyush, by this screenand I'll exactly type this. All right?I will say it out loudand you will be showing it on the screen.Write a cover letter of 300 wordsfor a software engineering jobat Amazon Indiafor someone who has 3 yearsof coding experienceand is a software engineering graduatefrom college.When this is coming,you will actually show this,tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,Meaning, on the entire screenonly this would be visible.Okay, nothing else.The typing sound will have to be shown.Brilliant man.Can you even imagine?Like ****the world is going to change so much?Is going to change so much?Okay and then, we will come in.Is AI going to give you jobor take your job?In this video,I will tell you about ChatGPTwhich might change the worldYou either have to be careful about itor you can change your life with it.What is ChatGPT?ChatGPT is probablythe fastest growing technologythat the world has ever learnedDon't believe it, see this.Now you will come to this animation.You have to animate it a bit maybe.Actually, don't even animateJust this screen,But one by one bring all these things in.So, Netflix, then Airbnb, then Facebook,then da, da, da, da, da, da.So, this is how we do it.To reach 1 million users,if 10 lakh people are usingthat technology,Netflix took 3-1/2 years to reach there.Airbnb took 2-1/2 years.Facebook took just 10 months.Spotify took 5 months.Instagram only 2-1/2 months.The iPhone took around 75 days.But there is one thing,which reached 1 million usersin just 5 days, ChatGPT.What is ChatGPT.ChatGPT is an artificial intelligenttext formation or generation tool.Where you can generate anythingby talking to it,you can get an answer to any question.As I showed you,that through one question,a 300-word cover lettertowards Amazon Indiafor a software job,when you have 3 years of coding experienceand you have done a software engineeringdegree from college.Did that literally in 15 secondsand you can do any such thingthat you would want an answer tothrough ChatGPT.I'm not going into all the technicalities.Iâll just stay up to the point. All right?How does ChatGPT work?The beauty aboutany artificial intelligence systemis whatever data has been producedin the world till datethat trains it.So, it understands, how things work.What all technologies have come.How much knowledge has come,through books, through research paper.And how people talk or thinkabout things, that trains it.So if we have a systemwhich can put all the knowledgeof the world in one computerand train it to learnhow it will consume that,that becomes smart.This is not a new technology.It's not the first timea chat bot has been released.But ChatGPT is so goodthat perhaps for the first timesuch a technology has come,Which is reducing the differencebetween humans and robots.So much so, that if a personreads the ChatGPTâs answer,So maybe he will not be able to concludewhether it was written by a humanor a machine.And this is the famous Turing test.Turing test was devisedto interpret or understandwhether or not a machineis artificially intelligent or smart.And the test was simple.That can a human determine by readingwhether this is produced by a machineor produced by a human.And I would concludethat ChatGPT is becoming increasingly moresomething that can pass the Turing test.But how can you use this ChatGPTin your life?Come letâs find out.Okay, and now we will just keepplaying with this.So, feel free, that you put a lot of,will keep coming and going on this,on the screen, all right?All the questions I am asking.I am telling you whatever comes to mind.I'll ask ChatGPT a lot of questionsand Iâll mumble somethingin that question,as the answer keeps coming.So, feel free to use the entire screenfor just the answer.My small bubble will be somewhere.First of all, to use ChatGPT,you have to go to chat.openai.com.It will then allow youto create an account.Many times, their servers are down.Why? Because they get so much load,which they did not anticipate,that slowly and graduallythey are getting a lot of demand.So, they recently releaseda premium version,which is for $42 a month.Means almost â¹3,500,which is a lot of money.But will someone like me pay for it? 100%.â¹3,500 for generatingthis kind of content,where I also write my video ideas in this.10 ways of being a smart investor.20 things that new investorsmake a mistake around.It will give me all the resultsand I get my inspiration through it.So, you can open your accounton chat.openai.comand then you can start chatting.For example,Iâll start a new chat.And you will see it on the screen.What are the examplesthat you can use?What are the capabilities?So, it remembers what the user had saidearlier in the conversation.You will see here are all the questionsthat I have asked already.It will also be trained to declineinappropriate requests.So, if I go back again.Applying for software engineering.You will see, to this cover letter,I can either give a thumbs upor a thumbs down.So, if I give thumbs up,it knows that, this was the right answerand that feeds backinto the training program.If I give it a downvote,then it again feeds backinto the training program.It will keep getting smarter by that.So, let's ask a simple questionand this is one way to use ChatGPT.You want to generate creative ideas.So, they have a suggestion,get any creative ideafor a 10-year-oldâs birthdayand youâll do on it.And it starts giving you ideas.That you can do a scavenger hunt.Basically, can do a treasure hunt.You can have a theme party.Can do a movie night.Can do a sleepover party,if there are small kids.Can do a DIY spa day.They are quite a bit Western answers.But if you, and this is somethingthat we can do, yeah,So, we can say.Give me 10 creative ideasfor a 7-year-old Indian kidstaying in Indiaor for a 7-year-old kid staying in India.Let's see how differentthese answers are from those.Theme party.Puppet show and magic show.Which was not here.And in India, puppet show and magic showare very popular.DIY crafts party.So it did not say, letâs do a spa day.Because who does spa day for children?Even we elders donât go to spas.But crafts party can do.A cooking party.A movie night.A nature exploration party.A sports day, puppet making,science experiments, storytelling.So, you will see,they improvised it a bit.And that is just so, so smart.And this happened in literally 5 seconds.So, you can make creative ideas out of it.You can have another chat and it says,write me a love song for my girlfriend,who is turning 23 this month.Oh sorry, had to make a love song.But fine, I think it understood.She is the light in my darkest days.The one who brightens all my ways.With her everything just feels right.She is my stunning star,my guiding light, ta, ta, ta, da.And then it also has chorus.Hey wow, even chorus.Happy birthday my love, my angel.You bring me so much joy and happiness.I'm so grateful for every moment.Wish you, my heart is truly blessed.Then verse two, da, da, da, da da.Even outro. Even making the outro.My God, so, you get all of these.Now, you can even do one for yourself.The idea is that you can exploreyour creativity with this.Number two.You can actually as a studentor as a working professionalget ideas around your work.So, if you want giveor take homework assistanceOr you have to do some workon your project.Let's say your project is,Think of, letâs say,you have to write a document or a pageon what are the 2-3 thingsthat India should dofor youth development?This is a project of yours.Be it in school or in college,or for working professionals,in their work.So, says write a 300 or actually no.List down 8 ways that the Indian youthcan be skilled for the next 10 years.Let's see.So, it will start giving you suggestions.You can do vocational training.You can create apprenticeship.Da, da, da, da.You can have online learning.Which is of course somethingthat we are all aware of.You can do certification coursesSo itâs giving you ideas.These ideas can assist youin your homework.Can assist you in our project report.Everything because this is the bestof what the world's knowledge is,trained on a system to make it scalable.Through the ChatGPT,you can also understand something.If you are learning style is readingthen this is the best way to read.So, if you say, explain Newton's first lawin simple language as if I am 5 years old.Then it starts.Newton's first law is like a rulefor how things move.It says that if somethingis sitting still,it will stay stillunless something else makes it move.This is a very simple way of explaining.But this is how it would explainit for you or to you.You can go and top it up.Explain and letâs say another chat.Explain stock investing to someonewho has never invested in stocks before.And it will go.Stock investing is the processof buying shares of ownershipin a publicly traded company.When you buy a stock,you become a part owner. Da, da, da, da.So, it will start explaining it as well.So, ChatGPT is a great wayfor you to learn something newif your learning style is reading.Number 3.This is brilliant for coders.Through ChatGPT you can actually.I was going to say JPT.Through ChatGPT you get codes generated.For example, itâs here.How do I make an HTPP,HTTP request in JavaScript?So, if you do this.It will actually show you how it worksand you can then start using itin your code as well.So, see this.Itâs actually writing the codeand then there is an option for youto copy the code in your open sourceAnd see this, there is an optionfor you to copy the codeand the same codecan be put into your code.All of this is open sourceand free to use.There is no copyright.No challenge anywhere, no restrictionand this is just wild.This is just one thing.I donât even know coding.So, I don't even knowwhat should be the right question to askbut this will be such a great wayto do that.Number next.You can actually getmeaningful relationship advice.ChatGPT is a machine.It doesn't have any emotions.But the knowledge and dataon which it is trained,is laced with every emotion in the worldconnected to it.So, if I were to ask ChatGPT,how do I get rid of a toxic friendshipthat I have had since childhood?I am scared to end itbecause it's been so long.The more detailed question you ask,the ChatGPT will give youa detailed answer.Let's see,what is the answer it gives here.Ending a long-term friendshipcan be difficult,but it's important to rememberthat it's okay to let go of relationshipsthat are no longer healthyor beneficial for you.Here are some steps that you can taketo end a toxic relationshipand then it actually gives youa step-by-step guidethat you can use to get to the answer.Limit contact, seek support,set boundaries.Acknowledge the problemand be prepared for the possibilityof a negative reaction.We all know what that means.Itâs just like, their brains explode,How did this happen?What happened?You will break our childhood friendship.Blah, blah, blah, blah.And then, it also says.It is also important to rememberthat this decision is not easyand it is okay to take timeto think about itand that you donât have to do it alone.This is being told to you by a computer.Itâs almost like a person, a therapist,a friend, is giving you this advice.Itâs just so pure,but thatâs how it works.You can also write music in any genre.A great strength of ChatGPT,as I said, is learned creativity.So, you can actually create musicand says create music for a love songthat is 3 minutes long.Sorry it can't create music.I can only create lyrics for the musicThat says, write lyrics for aâ¦Actually, weâll write a poem.How do I day âshareâ?Write a poem.Write a poem on losing a loved oneand realizing that you were the onewho made the mistake.Let's see how that goes.Computer gets stranded.Now when it gets slow,it can also be,thereâs pressure on the server.In sorrows grip I do reside,for the one I loved,has now died.I see the errors of my waysand realise the mistakes I made.I took for granted every dayand let my love slip away.I should have cherished every breath,but now it's too late in death.Like thatâs, that's actually a poem.It is actually a poem.Let's try and seeif it can do it in Hindi.In Hindi.You can see,the pace has slowed down a bit.Because it is actually trying to generatethis in real time.This question has never been asked before.Has never been askedin this shape and formand this poem that is coming out of it,has never been shared with anyone else.It is the first time then the worldis actually witnessing this poem come out.Losing someone makes me realize now,losing someone will hurt me now.What is this, one minute.Losing someone makes me realize now,losing someone will hurt me now.Did I do something to lose someone?To lose someone, did I do something wrong?Naturally, it is not as greatas the English one.But still processing. Weâll see.It has come to me now,that I have lost someone,losing someone, Iâve lost everything.Here even the ChatGPT has got lost.And you can imagine this is the beginning.Clearly not done a good job.But slowly and graduallyit will actually get to that pointwhere even this poem will come out.Now it is lost.Losing someone makes me realize now,losing someone hurts me now.Okay stop generating.I think you have done it.That also reminds me ChatGPTcan also work in many different languages.So, it can actually say,write a cover letter for Amazon Italy,for a software engineering job,in Italian language.And itâs actually doing that.I don't know Italian,so I don't know if this is correct or not.If Hindi is anything to go by,it might not be as goodas it was in English,but it is throwing up something,which we don't know what and it works.Finally, ChatGPT can turn outto be a very interesting companion.It's a text, so it takes a while to write.But imagine if ChatGPTstarts being used in voice,So, it could actually interpretwhat your voice is trying to askand then gives you the answerin that same term.So you can play with it.And do you know my name?Letâs see.I am sorry I do not know your name.Is there anything elsethat I can help you with?Okay, don't know.That's perfectly fine.What is likely to be the futureof the world.It is difficult to predict the futureof the world with certaintyas it depends on a complexset of factor that can change rapidly.Da, da, da, da.Then is going on giving his own answers.You can play with it.So, whenever you getting bored,you can just play around.and I actually do that.I use ChatGPT a lot now.Because I just keep learning through it.I just ask questions,try and learn, try and figure outwhat he is saying?How he is speaking?Try and figure outHow did he get that training,From where would he have got it,for it to do that?And it's just so much fun?So, the question now arisesif this one powerful tool,that has emergedand this is not just the first one,but one of many,but it seems to be the most powerful,and this is the beginning,think in voice, then think in video,then think in music,then think in post-production,and you are clearly looking at a worldthat is going to change so muchin 5-10 years,that you will have no ideaof how to do it.Will it take your job or not?The answer is yesand the answer is nowIf you do a task that is repeatable,that a machine can learn very quickly,then your job is at risk.But one thing that I hope you noticed,that in order to run this thing,it is very important to have one thing.That question.A machine can only give you an answer,That until now,and I don't think ever,will ask a question,Only we can ask questions.Only you can ask questions.If you have the ability to ask questions,then you will be able to workwith any machine and that machinewill then become your slave.It will not be somethingthat replaces you.It will be somethingthat will exist because of you.Then you have to put your entire trainingnot just in consuming,but in actually asking questionsAnd thatâs why I often say,The best learning happenswhen you get down to the root of a thingand try to understand it.That only happens when you ask questions,keep asking questions, keep askingSo, start questioningeverything that's happening.If you open any social media platform,you're having some fun with it,you are liking the Reels very much,the Shorts are looking very good,ask questions.What about this made it work?What about this made itso exciting for me?What about this got me hooked on?You will then get new answersfrom those questions.By those answers,youâll ask you more questionsand that is how you will get trainedfor tomorrow's world.This world is changing so fastthat all these toolswill stand in front of all of usand then many people will fall.Because they will not be able to compete.This world will be taken forward and runonly by those peoplewho have the ability to ask questions.Because they are the oneswho will be controlling the machines.So, your job is in danger.But if you keep asking questions.So, your job will change to a new job.Which will be working with these tools,these machinesto make the world a better place.Ankara Warrior, signing off.Okay, all the best Piyush.I have spoken a lot.So, you will have to of coursetrim it down.I have recorded 26 minutes.This video should not bemore than 20 minutes.So just cut as much as you can,Okay, all right. Thanks.
