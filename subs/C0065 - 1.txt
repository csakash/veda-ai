Hello check 1 2 checkAlright, Aditya a lot of Excelwill be used in this video sozoom in on that and figure it out.Ok lets' get started.If you want to retire before 30,then this video is for you.Through an excel sheet, I will tryto show you how you can retirebefore the age of 30?Friends, this is going to bea fun video, we are going touse a lot of excel in it.But there was one questionwhich many people often ask,in fact, a lot of times in my'Ask Me Anything' session on InstagramI receive a lot of comments saying,'I want to retire before 30!''How do I retire at 30?'So I thought let's answer this question.Now, you may not like this answerbecause the answer is very clear.It is very difficult that toretire by 30, but if I becomeabsolutely dispassionate,without any emotions,and try to answer this questionthrough numbers,then what would be its answer?To understand this and beforeworking on Excel it is importantto know the meaning of retirementor financial freedom, and here is what it means.The day it reaches a numberwhen its annual return isequal to your annual expense...No too longThe most important thing forfinancial freedom or retirementis investing.But what should you invest for?You have to invest to reach a pointwhere whatever you have savedthrough investing, the annual returnthat this amount gives you is sufficient foryour annual household expense.I'll say that once moreYou have saved so much that whateverannual return you get on it,is enough to cover yourannual household expense.For example, suppose yourmonthly expense is â¹10000,and you have â¹10 lakhs in your bank.If you can get a return of about10-12% on this â¹10 lakhs,then how much will you earn inan year on â¹10 lakhs?â¹ 1 lakh to â¹1,20,000,which is how much in a month?â¹10,000, which is equal to yourmonthly expense and that means ifyour monthly expenses are â¹10,000,and you have â¹10 lakhs in your bankwhich you can grow at the rateof 10%-12% for the rest of your life,then technically you do nothave work to earn.Now of course this is a verysimplistic view because it doesn'taccount for inflation.If your needs increase in the future,like if you want to buy a car,or a house, children's marriage,your marriage, anything else,is not accounted for. So we will getto know this more deeply throughan excel sheet but the definitionwould not change.The definition is that you havean amount that generates a yearly returnthat pays for all your needs and your wants.An amount that generates a returnwhich on a yearly basis paysfor your needs and your wants.This, my friend, is retirement.Retirement has got nothingto do with age.Retirement has got nothingto do with enjoyment.Retirement means that you havereached a point where you do nothave to work to earn,so you are free to do whateveryou want to do, and that is thebest form of freedom, right?Today I know that whatever I am doing,whether making content onYouTube and Instagram,or creating courses, or coachingor mentoring people, I do all thesebecause I genuinely enjoy it,and whatever money it makes ismore than enough for me to runfor the rest of my life,so I don't have to keep strugglingto go ahead in life, because in this zone,I can say no to a lot of thingsbecause I don't like doing it,I can say no to a lot of brandsbecause I don't want to work with them,I can say no to a lot of peoplebecause I want to reserve my timefor myself and my family,and those are the choicesI get to keep in life,so at the age of 41,while I am still working,I am technically retired.I am very happy that I have reachedthe 'retirement age', which isnot really an age but a mindset,and that is where I would lovefor all of you to get to.That will happen once youhave financial freedom.How? Let's work on the Excel sheet.Aditya, and starting the video now.So I have created this sheet,it is not important to knowhow I created it but I wouldlike to show you the structure of it.First of all, what is your current age?Let's assume that you are 20 years old.By the way, this can be for any age,so don't think like,'Oh, I am 28 years old sohow can I retire at 30?OrCan I retire in 2 years!?'It's not possible.The numbers will tell it all.All but you can add any numberand that is absolutely fine.All the numbers which are in greenare variables, you can add them.So I will assume that you are 20 years oldand you want to retire at the age of 30,which is your retirement age.What are your monthly expenses today?So, how much do you spend now,towards your needs and your wants?This does not include thethe amount you invest.All your expenses towards your needs,like your rent, your water bill,your electricity bill, your phone bill,your food bill, all of those,plus your wants. Wants that are limited,not like you want a car, a house,status symbol basically,so take care of your wants in a limited way,of course you can't live like a saint,something is always neededlike a good phone and good things around,but not like you want a private jet,because you want to retire by 30,and Ankur Warikoo has createda sheet for you, so he needsto work on that, not you.I don't know why I sound like an Americanwho is not an American.Ok, so your monthly expense.And then when you retire,which in this case is 30 years,what do you think your monthlyexpense would be at that time?Now this is â¹1,50,000 not when you are 30,this is â¹1,50,000 as per today's amount.At the age of 30, which meansafter 10 years these â¹1,50,000would be much more because of inflation.But the â¹40,000 that you spend today,what do you think you would be spendingafter 10 years according tothe value of money today?Naturally your needs would haveincreased, your wants wouldhave increased, maybe you wouldhave a family as well,so the expense would have increased,that is what you have to put in here.I will just calculate for you,what is the yearly increase,but that is of course,not something which is so important.The important thing is,how much is your expected increasepost retirement?And that means that your expenseof â¹1,50,000, what do you thinkby how much percentage would itincrease on a yearly basis?Again do not take inflationinto account, because all theseamounts are inflation-adjusted,all you have to tell is if intoday's date you spend â¹1,50,000in a year when you would be 30,by what percentage will thatâ¹1,50,000 grow every year?I have assumed it to be 3%,because it should not even grow rapidly,otherwise it's of no use.Now, starts your investing journey.The â¹40,000 that is spend in a month now,you have to invest also beyond thatbecause you want to retire by 30,and that means you will have toinvest somewhere to generate that return.We will talk about that.First of all, lump sum amount.Is there any amount, which maybeyour parents have kept aside for you,you received some amount through whatever,whether Rakhi, internship, freelancing,birthday, grandparents, anything,and you have invested that.Let's assume that you have â¹1 lakh,which you have collected somehow,and you invest it at the age of 20.After this you do a monthly SIP as well,Systematic Investment Plan,money that you will consistently investevery month, I will tell youwhere you can do it but you will invest,that will be in this â¹10,000.And then, now you cannot keep it atâ¹10,000 monthly every year, it must increase.Your salary will increase,naturally your expenses will also increase,and you will also have to increasethis accordingly then. So, you say that,'I will increase it by 10% every year,which means, in the first yearI will invest â¹10,000 every month,the next year I will invest â¹11,000instead of 10 which is an increaseof 10% and this is how it will go on'.Then comes the most important thingthat by how much can you grow thisinvestment of â¹1 lakhand â¹10,000 every month?If you take an FD...then you will get 5-6%.Inflation is 6%.So if you want to retire at theage of 30 by doing an FD,then please switch off from YouTubeand buy a lottery ticket,because that is how it will be possible!FD is such a rubbish that nowthere is a power cut. The moment I saidFD there is a power cut,it was genuinely not planned.You can see there is no electricityit'll be back in a bit.Don't let this AdityaIf my YouTube editor so he knowswhat needs to be done.FD takes away whateverlittle brightness is there life!I love the way we are roasting FD!It's almost been 10-15 seconds,electricity is not back.Oh, it's back!Because now I am taking the name ofEquitySo you will not invest in FD,or gold because even gold would giveyou at the maximum 8-10%, you willnot even do EPF or PPF you becausethey will also give you nearlythat return, that to the lock-in.You will invest in equity.Since you have a horizon of 10 yearswhich is quite a long process,so you will lock your mind for 10 years andforget everything else, and investeither in index funds, or Smallcases,or some selected stocks which youthink are doing well, you will notrack your brains a lot,because frankly getting a 15% returnin equity or stock marketin 10 years is very easy.Yes, you will not get 15% every year.It could be 7% in some years,-5 in some, 25 in some, 12 in some,but if you try to normaliseit over a 10-year period,you would have got a return of 15%.That is what I am assuming.Of course, you can change that number.We will assume inflation to be 6%because broadly it is around this only.Now let's move onto calculations.So if you do all this, meaning,starting from the age of 20 years,you invest â¹1 lakh lump sum forthe next 10 years, that is youinvested in the beginningand nothing else later,and then invested â¹10,000 every monthconsistently, then at the age of 30,which is your retirement age,you will have â¹88 lakhs in your bankwhich inflation adjusted willbe equal to â¹69 lakhs as of today.So, at the age of 30, you would haveâ¹88 lakhs but its inflation amountwould be â¹69 lakhs,because inflation reducesthe value of money.Now these at â¹69-70 lakhs...
