Pranjal Kamra is with me today on YouTube,our favorite influencer!How are you, Pranjal?I'm great, sir!I received your message,I was on the flight and just landed,and I've never received sucha nice message after removing my phonefrom flight mode.I was very happy!Thank you for having me, sir!Thank you so much, man!You are always very polite,and there's a question around that too.I must tell you this Pranjal,some of the questions are mine,but a lot of them have been submittedby the public that they wantto ask Pranjal when they get a chanceto meet you.So there are 20 questions,you can skip any 3 you want,and it's not a rapid-fireso take your time to discuss and talk, ok?And will I get money after answeringevery question, sir?Yes, absolutely!After answering 20 questions,you will get a SIP of a mutual fundfor free!Ok, let's start Pranjal.The first question is if you lookat the last 10 years of your lifewhich is quite a long time for yousince you are very young,what is the biggest change thathas happened in your life personally,like how have you changedin the last 10 years as a person?Aggression, sir.I was extremely aggressive.Till my school time, for 17-18-19 years,I would find reasons to fight.I used to fight a lot on the road,in school, and in college,so that has completely gone.I haven't had a fight in 10 years.I can't even imagine Pranjal Kamrafighting with anybody!Seriously?!Yes, sir!When I went to Anna Hazare's protest,I realized I was a nobody.Before that, I was the head boy in school,everybody knew my grandfatherand my mother,so I sort of had this thing thateverybody knows me in school.All the teachers were taught bymy grandfather or by my mother,so I had this feeling thateverybody knows me.Then I became a head boy,so I used to get attention.Once that environment changed,that space changed,that's when I realized that I am a no one,and that's when my aggression went away.Wow! That is beautiful, man!That is so amazing!Ok, so based on this,if you look at today's Pranjal,then what is the worst thing aboutPranjal today?Sir, ok, this is...Sir, I don't have peace.I am constantly looking for peaceand I can't find it.So it's not that I am overworked,or it's not that I am overstressed,or I am doing hard hours,but my brain is never at easeso sometimes I miss that.It's always been that way.I have an interest in music, in cricket,I think I can do everything,so sometimes I think,I was discussing with Priya yesterday,I want to starta music review YouTube channel,then today I was thinking thatI want to do something aroundpolitical discussions,around social issues,so with so many things,it's hard to focus on one thing,so I am never at peace.Wow!And I can understand this emotionthat you feel that you have to doa lot of things, and you can do it too,because you found that trickto make everything work,and frankly that trick is not difficult.If you do anything with full dedication,then ultimately it works out.But once you get addicted,then you are like,Oh my god! What's next?So I can imagine.Wow! Ok.A mistake you wish you shouldn't have madein your 20s?Right, I wouldn't say the 20s,I would say late teens or early 20s,I shouldn't have left cricket,so that's my first love,and I was very good at it,till 14-15 in my age group,I was always by far the best.I got glasses in high school,and I didn't even realizeI had to get glasses becauseI used to sit at the front of the class,so my bowling started suffering.There was school during the dayso we used to practice in the evening,and I found out after a year and a halfthat this is happening becauseof my falling vision.So for a year and a half,my performance was bad,and I was demotivated,I discussed it with my father and he said,10th boards are approaching,this is the time you should leave,you are falling behind.And I quit, so that's a huge regret.And I think you get a lot of goodlife lessons from cricket and investing.When I used to watch test matchesfor the whole day, the perseveranceand the determination that once you crossthe tough timesthen everything becomes easier.So cricket gave me a lot of life lessons.Patience, tiring the bowler out,and psychological games.Once you know how to getthe bat to ball psychology,and mental toughness,so I miss those aspects which helpeda lot in personality growth.Do you still play cricket?I have started to play every dayfor the past 6 months,so my aim is to play an IPL matchat least once, I am very serious, in fact,I am starting professional coaching too.That's incredible!I love that story!I remembered that picture,which one was it? Praveen?Praveen Tambe.The inspiration behind it is the same.Oh wow! That is so awesome!I wouldn't be surprised one bitif I find you in an IPL match.This country would go crazy by seeingPranjal Kamra in an IPL!It will be so amazing!Awesome!I hope so!Something that the world told youin your 20s, and now you realizethat it was a lie?Sir, in this case, I would saythat I have been lucky.Fortunately, my father was always okwith me being a rebel.So one thing that I thinkI have always done is never followwhat the masses say.So if a film is being really likedin the theatres, I would know thatif everyone is liking it,I am not watching it.It's the same across categories.If the masses like anything,either I want to create it,or I want to read somethingthat no one is reading.I've always liked second-level thinkingor going one step beyond.So in my childhood,I remember I would hate Salman Khanand Shahrukh Khan just because everyoneis liking them.So whatever everyone liked,I would not like that,I would have a contrary opinion,things like that.So, fortunatelythis didn't happen with me,but what happened was that with aggressionalso came overconfidence.So I was very overconfident aboutmy abilities, my skills,and things like that,and at times I would feel thatwhatever was happening, I earned it,rather than realizingthe role of chance in it,luck in it, and things like that,so I focused a lot on resultsand that actually changed my mood.So moving away from that,I think I have become moreprocess-oriented and not worryabout results.But even losing a game of ludowould upset me for 2 hours,so that has changed, that was really bad. Wow!Basically, you always liked to win.And that has changed,that has completely changed.That has changed.Now you like to play!Yes.Because of that, I have not enjoyeda lot of good moments,because everyone was enjoyingand I was in a competitive mood,I was in a different mode.And I lost a lot of friendshipsbecause of that as it showed on my face.I get it!That's a wonderful journey, man!To cover that journey,realize things and make corrections,to become the new you is brilliant!Awesome!This question has been asked bya lot of people, I have it too,but I think now I know the answer.How are you so humble?Like you are genuinely always so polite,always so humble, always showing yourselfas if I have still to grow,I have still to learn,and I think I got to knowfrom your answersbut I would love to hear that again.How are you so humble?Thank you so much!Sir, 2 aspects to it, I would say.In all my teenage years and early 20s,I have seen the consequencesof not being this way,so I know those consequences firsthand.And second, I think it came fromwhen I was 23-24,I read My Experiments with Truth,so that is one life-changing bookthat I read,and one core thing that it taught meis thatwe have to understand that we arenot the center of the universe.I would even say if you aska random person,probably he would not even rememberall the prime ministersand presidents of Indiain the last 70 years.We would not remember their names,especially in the 90swhen a lot of prime ministers came.So imagine even if you or I rise up tobecome prime ministers,even then people will forget us,and this is just 30 years ago,and people don't even remember,so no matter what we do,no matter how big we become,we will eventually be inconsequential.And I think once that realizationcomes in,to me I think it is all-pervasive.One, this single thought changedmy entire personality that I am a no one.Wonderful, man!Pranjal, what is the most undesirablepart of your day?I am struggling to wake up early.I wake up around 7:30 a.m.I want to make it 6-6:30 a.m,and I do physical activitiesin the evening,I play cricket for a couple of hours,but physical activities in the morningis something I am not able to do,so I want to start that.By the time I come to the officeat 10 a.m,so 7:30 to 10 is when I feelI am not utilizing my time.Got it!Perfect!Who manages your money now?Sir, I want to do it and I do it too,but then my father likes some propertyand he takes the money.Story of every house!I think that crops from the fact that10 years ago, we did not havea single property.So my grandfather and my grandmotherlived for 70 years without owninga single parcel of land,my father and mother lived for 50 yearswithout owning a single parcel of land,so now when they see that they can,they can't resist it.In fact, it's ironic in a way,but honestly, 70% of my net worthis in real estate because of this.I know, that's my next question.Right now, how is your money divided,in which share and other places?70% is in real estate, and what aboutthe remaining?Sir, 70% is in real estate,20% is in stocks,I don't even invest in mutual funds,I do only ELSS which is needed for 80C,and 10% is in gold.This is excluding my emergency fund.I am only talking aboutmy long-term investments,so the remaining 10% is insovereign gold bonds.Got it!Do you actually pick your stocks yourself?Yes.I love that so I can't assign thatto anybody else.And how actively do you refresh it?That's a good thing, sir,I think every year in an average market,like what happened in March 2020,probably I bought a dozen stocks,around 8-10,but in an average year,I exit 3-4 companies, I buy 3-4 companies.So if I have 20 stocks,roughly in 5 years,my portfolio is 100% churned.Got it!But you are still very very passive, man,amazing!You do long-term patient investing.I can't find a company.I hardly get a company in 3-4 months.And in researching these companies,do you mostly do secondary researchor do primary research as well,means you meet the founder of that companyor meet the managementor something like that?Not at all, sir.I think if I become 100X also,that's the last thing I would want to do,because someone who hasa 10,000 crore market cap company,50,000 crore market cap companyis definitely a good salesman,they definitely havethe required marketing skill,then why would I expose myself to that.If I am liking the company froma distance from my own researchis when I buy.If I go to them, they will definitelymake me like it.Awesome! Love that!A question that people bother usby asking, but what can we do?They are asking Pranjal Kamra,Please tell us a mutual fund forthe long-term.Sir, for 5 years I have been sayingParag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund,and I only invest in its taxable versionbecause I see 2 advantages in taxable.One is 80C, and even if I want,I cannot sell in 3 years,so a discipline of 3 years is built in,and the returns are the samefor both categories,but if someone has a liquidity issue,then Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund.I would 100% agree with that.Sir, it's good that you asked one only,because I know only one good fund.Even my world stops at Parag Parikh,I don't know anything else.If they ask me which one should we buyin Nifty 50,I say that I genuinely don't know.Buy anything SBI, HDFC, it doesn't matter,go for Nifty 50.Awesome! Great!What is the most expensive thing you ownbesides real estate,because that must be expensive?Besides real estate,I bought a car last year,just before Ford shut down, Ford Figo,which was for 9 lakhs,that's what I bought, sir.And what do you think will bethe most expensive thingyou will buy outside of real estate?Sir, I am not interested in anything,not at all, maybe after 4-5 years,if there's any EV,I don't have any other interests.I think it would be a car.I am fond of that.Sir, I don't want that at all.I will remain very clear,it would be a conflict of interest.Ok, should I talk about liability?What would be the most expensiveliability?That would be a car.I have no idea where I would bebusiness-wise.Are you fond of cars?I am not fond of buying,but it's not like I want fancyand expensive cars, I like to lookfor bargains there also.If I were to tell you how I decidedon Ford Figo, I wanted a small carthat has top converter as automaticand 6 airbags,these were my 2 requirements,and the cheapest one at that.And I was also looking atthe tax evasion part,how is it with a car smaller than 4 m,I started to read about engines,I understood things about mileage,if you reduce the weight mileage increasesand it is not rocket science,so safety compromised,and that's how I got interested,but not as a buyer,just reading about an industry.I have been traveling a lot sincethe last year, so I am readinga lot about the hotel industry.The manager of the hotel I am going to,has to sit with me for half an hour,till then I do not check out.So I'm enjoying it,but not as a consumer,just interested in learning something new.Got it, man!That's awesome, wonderful!Pick between money and power.Power.Why?Sir, maybe because you likewhat you don't have right now,so maybe my state of mind is that,but right now I desperately misseither being an IPS or IAS officeror being a powerful politician,I miss that the most in life right now.A lot of issues trouble me,and I think I can express that opinion,so if I have the powerthen I can bring change.So right now, I don't have peace becauseI feel what I'm doing is not enoughfor the quantum of problemsthat our country, the society,and cities around me face.So I crave power right now.Got it.I feel that you will get into politics.I really want to.I don't know whether in 5-10 years,but I definitely want to.Amazing, man!The country needs people like you, 100%.Before that, I would go for a jail visit,how is it because no matterwhich political party you are in,you definitely have to go to jail once,so I really want to see how Indian jailsare before I join politics.Ok, what would you choose betweenspeed and perfection, Pranjal?Sir, it's evolving.I think when I started,I thought speed is very important,and I think when you havenothing to lose,speed is the way to go,so I think it's also aboutthe space you are in.So as of today,I think I have something to lose,so today it's important,whether in investing or in businessor in my public image, it's importantthat I build on whatever I've builtand never put at riskwhat I've already built.So, today perfection is more important,but if I'm starting again from scratchI would again prefer speed.Amazing! I love what you said.When you've nothing to lose,speed is the right way to go.Wonderful! That's such a powerful wayof thinking about it.Great!Outside of your current location,is there any other citywhere you would want to live?Sir, I really like three places in India.I like Vizag a lot,I find it really beautiful,the combination of mountains and beaches,and how clean and developed it is.I really like Bhopal,its food and its lakes.And another is of course Goa.I go to Goa once or twice every year,I love the vibe there.So I really like these three places, sir.Nice! These are good choicesand they are very livable cities.Goa is of course a statebut very very livable.Ok, what would Pranjal Kamra likebetween beaches and mountains?Beaches.Probably because my father has taken usto the mountains so much,I think I've gone to Himachal20 times in the last 20 years,so I am extremely bored,and my father doesn't like beaches,so he has not taken us their ever,so that's why beaches.If you could become the CEO ofa current startup,which startup would it be?You have to choose!Zerodha.Oh lovely!I just had a word with Nitin Kamathhalf an hour back,and we had this converstaion.I am a big fan of Zerodha.So what was his answer, sir?Zoba.Oh, that would be my second answer.He said,I want to do something which ishuge and bootstrapped,so that I don't ever haveto take anybody's calls.So I was like,yeah, good criteria.That awesome! Wonderful!Last two questions, Pranjal.The first one, do you listen to music?A lot, sir.Any song which is Pranjal's favorite song?I really likeHawaiian from Harry Met Sejal.Very nice!In fact, whenever I start my podcast,I have thought about it,so the first person I want to interviewis Pritam.I think he is an absolute genius.That awesome!When are you starting your podcast,you definitely should?Yes sir, I have thought about it,maybe in a couple of months,but it would not be on finance,I have had it.I am extremely bored talkingabout finance now.No, that's okYou have done enough.You have prepared your class.Now your students can watch yourcontent of so many yearsand learn thoroughly.Sir, now I have to create my vote bank.Exactly!Now gradually, you have to go from beingan MLA to MP to being a prime minister.Ok, the last one, do you read books?But then I realized sir...Yes, tell us.Yes, sir.No, go ahead. What did you realize?You cannot win an election justbecause you are an influencer,because what we think is a plusthat the whole country is watching usis actually a downside in the elections,because you have to be visibleto the people of your parliamentaryor assembly constituencies.So I realized that out of35-50 lakh people, only 5,000 peoplefrom my area would be watching me,so it's not going to help.You have to get on the roadsand this is a hard part about it.I see that even the prime ministerhas to get on the roadsat the time of elections, so that is hard.At 29-30 years of age,doing the groundwork,being in sweat and dust, so I can imagine60-70-80-year-old people doing it,it's actually hard work.Yes absolutely, man.Being in politics and doing itsuccessfully for several decades isa different level of commitment,and yeah, it is insane.Awesome!Any book that you often recommendto people among the books that you read?My most gifted book isTuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom.Wow! Amazing!I think absolutely the best bookI have read.And, My Experiments with Truth.Yes.Both of them, incredible!Awesome!Perfect!One last selfish, greedy question,Pranjal because 20 questions are over,and I got to learn a lot.When you started your YouTube journey,and of course,you started creating contentaround finance and everything like that,there must be a lot of peoplewho were trolling you,and saying things like,Who are you?Where have you come from?What are you saying?Why are you saying this?And you were also, I am assuming,going through a phase where you weretransforming from an aggressive Pranjalto a calm Pranjal.No, it had happened by that time, sir.It was done, right?So, did that spark some old memories?How was your reaction?How did you deal with that when itfirst started hitting you?Sir, I think to associate one,because nobody was watching mefor 6 months, so I remember,two of my friends were getting married,and they were the first friends of minewho get married.So while they were getting married,one of my videos crossed 5,000 viewsfor the first time,no video had crossed even 500,so that was the day when some commentsstarted coming in, otherwise,there would be 1-2 comments in a day,but that day there were 20-30-40 comments,and most of them were hateful,because the way I spoke was not great,lighting was not good,everything was weird,but rather than me focusing on the hate,the big thing for me was somebody sawthe video after 8 monthsand commented on it,and I got views, so that hate had takena backseat.I knew that if this snowball starts,where people start watching consistently,so from the comments that were coming in,I have to work on the factorthat people are not liking,but at least my first step is on,my video reached 5,000and I was very happy that day.And after that, I realized that,like I don't see my comments,I haven't seen my comments forthe last 4-5 years, neither good nor bad,so I don't remembera single hateful commentbecause I haven't read it.I think for me, my investing journeyand my content creation journeywere parallel,so I don't even take feedback on the topicfor a video.Whatever new I am learning or reading,that's what I work on.So in my mind, I am a vlogger.I spoke about whateverI learned this week.I don't know if it's right or wrong,but I think it has worked for me,and what happens is,because it's so personaland not two-way,I am able to give more timeto my business,and I hardly give any time on thisbecause it's not process oriented.So I think that has worked for me.That's why I don't read them,because then I don't knowif subconsciously I am making itby listening to peopleor if it's totally mine,so I don't watch comments at all.Very nice, very very smart!Sir, I know this is not the way you do it.It's a very sane way of doing it.Ok.And that is why I was so happywhen we met in Bombay the last time,and you told me how you have progressedand how you have started spendinga lot more time with yourself,traveling, and so on,and your business is doing well and so on,that is genuinelythe best way to live life,where the machineryhas become bigger than you.You know somehow it just so happensthat whenever we talk, I am not seekingcertain answers from you,but in our conversation,you probably figure out the phase I am in,and always give me the right answers,it has always happened.Wow! I will not take any credit for that.I think you are a great student,so you continue learning from the peoplearound you.So that is your superpower!Amazing! Thank you so much Pranjal!It was great!I saw a different you,something which is very surprising to me.So thank you for being so candid,so honest, all the best with everythingthat you have scheduled to do.I would be the happiest if people like youcomes into the top leagues of politics,and starts doing somethingfor this country.Thank you so much, sir!See, I'm even practicing folding hands.I know!Exactly!Thank you, sir!All the best, Pranjal!It was great fun, sir!Thank you!Bye, sir!Bye!
