How to save money onthree necessary things?Online shopping, transportation,electricity.We will cover all three.Let's start with online shopping.Number 1: Price comparison.Price comparison is asure shot way to tell youthat whatever productyou are buying online,whether you are buying itat the right price or not,or on which site you willget it at the cheapest price.There are a lot ofprice comparison appsor websites, please use themand search for the product.It will give you the cheapestplace that you can buy from.Number 2: Incognito.There are a lot of websites that knowthat you are searchingfor a product on themand they try to increaseyour price gradually.So, the best way toalways shop online isdon't shop through apps.Shop through websites andthat too in incognito modeso that they have no idea thatyou have already bought itand this will securea good price for you.Number 3: Discount websites.There can be student discounts,avail them.There can be group discounts.Something like nearbuy,EasyDiner,or magicpin.These are all the destinationswhere you will getsome cashback ordiscount on your bill.Paytm often givesyou instant cashbackby scanning the QR code to pay the bill.Use these because these aresmart ways to save money,not just online but offline as well.Number 4: Renewed orrefurbished items.A lot of times if youare searching on Amazonfor a phone,you will see a brand new phone,and then you will alsofind a refurbished phone.Refurbished phones are avalue-for-money itemsbecause the companyhas made them as newand you get an extendedguarantee warranty as well.You might not get a boxbut you get phone andits basic accessoriesand they are extremely lower price.So think of it like second hand phonesbut you are not buyingit through a personbut through a company.Next, smart use of credit cards.You can earn a lot ofmoney from credit cardsand you can also save money.Number 1:Credit cards often run offersfor their members.So through that, you can save moneyin their schemes and theirevents and festivals.Number 2: You get a30-day interest-free loan.In that period, the same moneythat you should already have,you will never buy anything using credit cards on loans.You will only buy itbecause you have all that money,and only for points,for your credit rating,and for this processwhich I am going to tell you,we are doing it for that.So suppose you boughta phone for â¹1 lakh,and you bought it today.The bill will be generated after a month.You will have to make a paymentafter 2 weeks.So after 6 weeks,you will have to makea payment of â¹1 lakh.Get it FD for â¹1 lakhfor 6 weeks.You won't get muchbut whatever you get,it is free money.There is no load,and you get that.As soon as that FD matures,after 6 weeks,you will pay theentire bill of â¹1 lakh.Done.This is what I dobecause the expenses of mycredit card are very high,and that is a smartway of making money.Number 2: Credit history.When you pay the entire billof the credit card every month,you essentially developyour credit rating,and because of credit rating,you get loans at alower rate of interest.So if you take a carloan in the future,take a personal loan,take a home loan,you will get a better rate of interestthrough which you are saving money.So credit cards will also allow you tosave money indirectlyon the future loansthat you will take.Number 3: Rewards.Whenever you swipe your credit card,you get points.Through those points,you can redeem vouchers,you can book rooms in hotels,you can take flight tickets.You get a lot of mileagethrough using the right credit cardand that is why using credit cardswill also help you save money.Smart clothing choices.You buy a lot of clothes onlineand you end up wasting a lot of money.If you buy clothes smartly,you will make a lot of combinationsusing the least amountof clothes possible.So there are apps,ACloset,Smart Closet,which look at your itemsand try to make unique combinationsgiving you a new lookwith the exact same clothesthat you already have.Through this,you will buy less clothes.Through this,you will buy less clothes,save money,and remain smart.Next, renting or reselling.If you are not using anything,either put it on rentor sell it.You can sell it on OLX,but rent is also a very big option.You have a camera,it is noisy,you don't use it,or you use it once a month,or you use it once or twice a year.Rest of the time,give it on rent.Go to a camera shopand tell themthat this is my camera,I want to sell it on rent.You do thisand give me a cut,And there are enough and more locallywho will be able to do that.You have a designer wear,you made a lehenga for the weddingor a suit,and you want to give it outfor rent as well.Please do that.If something is lying around,like in our country,If something is lying around,like in our country,Vidur, he plays the piano.So, we recently migratedto an acoustic piano.So, his digital piano is there.We have kept the entire bill well,and now,we bought thatsecond-hand by the way.â¹65,000 MRP.We bought that for â¹35,000within one and a half years itself.So whoever bought itwas selling it within 1.5 years.So, â¹35,000 was the price.Now we are selling it backand we will get aroundâ¹20,000 or â¹15,000 rupees.And we have used it for 3.5 years.Smart way of doing it.So it is still lying around.People come and see,and a bid has also come,and hopefully,by the time this video comes out,that too would have gone out.This is a smart way for youto keep churning out moneyand not lose moneyon anything that you own.Let me tell you some tips aboutoffline shopping,and these will be psychological tips.Number 1:Always take a shopping list.It has been proven thatthe people who have a shopping list,they stay in their budget.Those who don't have it,buy this.Take that too.Oh, I wanted this too.I wanted that too.And it's over.Number 2:Never shop on an empty stomach.It has been proven that64% of the times,if you are hungry,you end up buying more,which is not food.Anything.So an empty stomachin a waycreates curiosity.Let's take this and that.And that's it.Gone for a toss.Will eat more.Will also buy more.Number 3:Always try to go foran express checkoutbecause the long checkouts,you must have noticed in retail stores,that chewing gum,that chocolate,that magazine,that Maggi,those things lying around,those are lying around,and when you are getting bored,because you are standing in a line,you pick it up.Picked this up too.â¹5, â¹10, â¹15.It's only for â¹20.Pick it u,but you are picking up junkand spending its money too.Don't make that mistake.Next, it's very interesting.The storewhere fast music is playing,you will end up buying moreas compared to a storewhere slow music is playing.Isn't it fascinating?Basically, when fast music is playing,your mind becomes active,and because your mind becomes active,you start makingdecisions very quickly.So, you end up decidingthat I want this thingand I want this thing.And that gets you to shop more.When slow music is playing,you tend to slow down,which is why you will seethat in restaurants,slow music is played.Why?Because they wantyou to sit,stay thereand keep ordering.But in fast food restaurants,fast music is playedbecause they want you to come,take an orderand leave.And that is the difference.So never,I won't say never,but as much as possible,don't enter a fast music store.You will be psychologicallyprimed to purchase more.And finally,this is the best hack.Whenever you want anything in life,wait for 30 days,and ask yourself after 30 days,do I still want that thing or not?90% of the chances will bethat you won't wantthat thing anymore,and that will save youtime, effort and money.Now let's come tothe electricity bill.Now in the electricity bill,you will ask,"How to save money on electricity? Because you can't save in this."And you are right.If you do it in a standard way,then what the mother says,only that can reduce the electricity bill."My dear child,before leaving the room,turn off the lights.Turn off the fans and electricity."But how much will you save?So the best way is,consider solar.In solar,you replace electricity from fossil fuelswith electricity from the sun,and there are multiple benefitsof making this happen.So, there are 3 ways to do solar.There is something called on-grid,meaning whatever solar energy,the government or whateverelectricity distribution companiesare generating, through them.Off-grid means you willinstall your own solar panel.And then hybrid,where you can do bothon-grid and off-grid.In this conversation,we will only talk about on-grid.The first thing about on-grid is,the government gives many subsidies.So, the subsidies differ state-wisebut whichever state you are in,if you install an on-gridnetwork or panel,then the governmentwill give you a subsidy,which will help you lowerdown the upfront cost,which is often a lot in solar.Second thing,any solar panel,especially on-grid,has a lifetime of 20-25 yearsbecause it loses 0.5%efficiency every year.So, it runs well for 20-25 years.And third,in solar,the bill is near 0.So the way that you haveto think in your head is,on today's date,what is your monthly expense?And if it becomes near 0,or even less than 90%,then over a period of time,how will you save money on it?For example,if your monthly bill is â¹4,500,and suppose you use around4 kW electricity every month,if you replace it with solar,then the same â¹4,500 billwill become a bill of â¹500,which means you will saveâ¹4,000 a month,in a year.That will become almostâ¹40,000-â¹45,000.I am not saying â¹48,000 becausethere will be some variations,and your upfront investment,which for this 4 kW house,will be anywhere betweenâ¹1.5 lakhs to â¹2 lakhs,you will recover between 3-4 years,which means within 3-4 years,your upfront amountwill be fully recovered.After that,for 20 years,free electricity.Isn't that awesome!Because then you are saving money,every single year,almost forever.So how to do this?First of all, go to the website,solarrooftop.gov.inand register for Solar Rooftop.Then your DISCOM,distribution company,will generate a feasibility report,that how much you want,what you want, etc.And then through an approved partner,you have to install this panel.Then whatever will be thedetails of your system,you will submit it in your local grid,and through that,you will get a net meter.Net meter means thatyou only pay for thenet units that are consumed.So, the net of export-importthat comes out,you are paying only for that.That is why it's very important thatwhenever you install solar panels,the highest tariff rate,where you have to pay the mostfor a unit of electricity,you install it keeping that in mindso that your net amount will beminimal and cost-effective.If you get a net meter,then DISCOM will issue a certificateand you are up and running.With this certificate,submit your bank detailsand the subsidy that thegovernment is going to give you,according to your state government,will come to you within30 days approximately.Now this seems like a lot of work,that you are sitting comfortably,you listen to your mom,come out of the room,and turn off the fan and lights.Why take the load?I would say, two reasons.Number 1: You will save money.Number 2: It's environment-friendly.We are already killing our planetthat if anything,even a single person,will start taking these small steps,it will add up to a lotand make things betterfor the entire world,especially for your childreneven if they are not yet born,and they will be,you will leave them abetter world than otherwise.Final, transportation.How to save money for travelling?Now, travelling meansnot Goa,inter-city travel.There are 3 options in inter-city.You can take public transport,you can rent a car,or you can buy a car.There are 2 options in buying a car.You can buy first-hand,or second-hand.All of these are amathematical exercise.Let's try it.I have made a whole video on this,that if you get an Ola/Uber,I have not compared with metro,because if we arecomparing with a car,then we'll compare it with Ola/Uber.So if you are getting an Ola/Uber,or renting a car,or buying your own car,what is the difference?I have personallyrented my own car,and it is economicallyworking out for mebasis the distance we travel,and every three years,we replace our car.So at the end of 2024,in December,our lease will end,and then 2025 is when wewill go into a new lease.Now at that point,we will again do the same math,that either rent a car,or buy it ourself.We use Ola/Uber,but it can't be the dominant way,because there is family,so they need a little predictability.Maybe at your age,we don't require it that much.And that's why,the decision will be again evaluated.What are the parametersof the decision?Number 1:Cost of ownership.Cost of ownership ofpublic transport is zero.You don't have any cost of ownership.You just have to payfor making that transport happenwhen you need that transportation.If you rent,cost of ownership istotally included in the rent of the car.So we pay â¹25,000 per month.In that â¹25,000,the car is actually in our name.It is not a yellow number plate,or a cab number plate.It is a white number plate.Number 2: Maintenance.That is also included.Number 3: Insurance.That is also included.So these three costs ofownership are included.The only thing we have to spend onis petrol and parking.We don't bear anyother cost of our car.The car company bears the cost.If it is your own car,then you have to buy the car,you have to maintain the car,you have to insure the car,and that all is on you.Then the second thing,depreciation.Depreciation is a big thing,which people usually don't keep in mind.There is no depreciationin public transport.The car is not yours,and you don't have any load,but if you are renting a car,even then,your rental amount is the same.So you don't have tobear any depreciation.In fact, because we have boughtthe car on the company's budget,so we expense this,and it lowers down our profit.so we expense this,and that is even a better decision,than if I was buyingit on a retail basis.If you own a car,then you can't avail thebenefit of depreciationbecause you are not a company,which can avail if thecompany owns a car.Unfortunately,the value of your car keepsdecreasing every year,which means,when you sell this car in the future,you will not get whatyou had paid for,much, much, much, lesser,and that is lost valueover and abovethe expenses you have already doneto maintain it, to insure it,to drive it, you arespending all that.On top of that,the value of your car has decreased.And biggest thing,opportunity cost.This is the most important thingwhich often people don't includein their financial decisions.Let's assume that you areeligible to buy a carbut you still don't buy a car.Now the way to think about this,is whatever EMI you could have given,to own the car,what will you do with it?Will you spend it on other things?Or will you ignore it for no reason?No.You will invest itbecause that is your opportunity cost.If you were ready to giveâ¹10,000 per month for EMI,but you are using public transport,and in that you arespending only â¹5,000,then if you invest theremaining 5,000 rupees,that becomes youropportunity cost gained.It means over a period of time,you will have â¹60,000invested amount per year,which will meanthat maybe in 2-3 years,you will buy a carwith the same amountbecause your opportunity costpaid for the purchase.But if you own the car,and give EMI of â¹10,000,then your opportunity cost is actually real.It means it is an actual expensebecause you could havedone it for cheaper,and you did not include that.That is why rentinga car makes sensebecause renting a car for a short period of timemeans that if youinclude opportunity costand cost of ownershipover a period of 3 years,you end up saving about 10%which may not seem like a lotbut I am very happywith that flexibilitybecause I have nodesire to own a car.And if I can save 10% ofthe car value by renting,then it is perfect.I don't have any problem in thatbecause then every 3 years,I keep changing my car.Get a new one, drive it, and get a new one,and drive it, and get a new one,and keep saving moneyin the process as well.This is how you saveon transportation.So if you combine these 3 things,saving money on online shoppingor shopping in general,saving money on electricity,saving money on transportation,this will comprise a meaningfulpart of your expenses,and that will help you become smarter with your investments eventually.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
