Alright check 1 2There may be many cuts in this videobecause this is a technical videoso I will have to refer to my notesagain and again so you will haveto make some transitions.Alright let's get startedIf you have an interest in technology,if you have started your career,or you are about to start your career,then there is a technological wavegoing around the worldthat will keep going around,and I am going to talk about it in this video,and through that present to you,a new career opportunity.Friends, you must have heard aboutCrypto but this video is not about Crypto.In fact, this video is to sensitizeyou that the world of Crypto is notlimited to Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or Dogecoin,or Solana, in fact a new world is in the making,about which you may not know,and even if you do know,then you do not have that much awarenessthat you will be able to see itin a different perspective.There are many people amongst us,who when they hear the word Cryptothink about buying and selling tokens,trading in Bitcoin, and that is reasonable,but that is a very very small percentage of theentire change that is happening in the world.In this video, I will introduce Web3 to you.What are its nuances?Why is Web3 a very interesting developmentwhich is about to change the whole world?And keeping that in mind, how can you see Web3as a career opportunity,something which may be super exciting,and possibly the chance andopportunity of a lifetime if you areinterested in technology?Quickly, what is Web3?For this, I will have to define Web1 and Web2.Web1.0 started in around the 90sand was there till 2005.Of course, there is no date or milestonebut these are the broad terms.Web1.0 was a one-dimensional,one-sided view of the internet.The websites that were created on the Internetin the beginning, people mostly usedto consume them. They could not createor interact with them much.So, companies used to create their websites,many communities and institutionsused to make the website and it waslargely an information era,where we used to learn, see, and read a lot,but you could only read whateverwas presented to you.In that way, Web1.0 is also calledthe read-only era, where you could only read,there was nothing else to do.Then in 2004-2005, a new era startedwhich was the Web2.0 era.And Web2.0 era was all about networks, communities.That was the time when Facebook started,YouTube started, and then later WhatsApp,Instagram, TikTok, all these networksof which we are a big partand even they are present in our lives in a big way,that all happened in Web2.0,which is still ongoing, but now Web3.0is knocking at its door and saying,your time is up, now it's my turn!What happened in Web2.0?The biggest change was that you transformedfrom a read-only to a read-and-write format,you got an opportunity for creation.If you were on Facebook,then you could express your thoughtsand share them with the world.If you were on YouTube,then you could create videosand share them with the world.So, it became a following, a community of sorts,where through your content and thoughts,you could make a following, a community,and create a network.And that was phenomenal,but the reality is that all thesecommunities were fundamentallybeing made on very few platforms.There is Google which controls all thesecommunities like Google, YouTube.There is Facebook which controls Facebook,Instagram, and WhatsApp.There is an Apple community which controlsthe world of Apple, so on and so forth.So, if you see, in Web2.0,you did make a lot of communities,but a lot of power was given to a fewselected companies, and because of that,there was a lot of centralization,these companies got a lot of control,a lot of power.Now, Web3.0 wants to change all of this.Web3.0 is a world that is there forread-and-write, but the fundamental aspectof Web3.0 is decentralization.A concept that means that the powerwill not be with one person,the power will be distributed amongstall the users of that community itself.It is a very powerful concept.Based on this, the technology ofblockchain emerged.Based on this, all the currencieslike Bitcoin and all emerged.Based on this, many platforms justas Ethereum were established.And the fundamental nuance is thatno particular individual controls it.It is an open world.A world which is distributed far and wide,through a network of computers,and each and every participant isa beneficiary of this networkand also a governing user, which meansjust like in a democracy,we all have a voting rightand elect a government. Here they say,no government will be elected.Imagine a country where there isno Prime Minister, no President,no ministers, anybody can launcha rule, anybody can introduce a bill,and every participant will vote on it,and if it gets a majority of votes,then that rule or that bill will get passedand it will be applicable to everyonein that network.That is the power!So, the biggest thing is,in Web1.0, companies were the identity.In Web2.0, communities were the identity.And in Web3.0, we all as individuals are the identity.Now, why is this change interesting?It is extremely interestingand super super exciting! Why?Because when Web2.0 came, for that mattereven when Web1.0 came, they creatednew opportunities about which peoplewere not even aware.For example, and many of you may not beeven able to understand it properly,because you all were born duringthe internet in a way.I was born in 1980 when there wasno internet, then the internet came,and I saw it evolving. Facebook came in 2005,I still remember, there was somethingcalled Orkut in 2003-2004.In 2005, I was in ISB, and a new worldof Facebook came, and all my batchmatesof ISB slowly started joining Facebook,and then we started hanging out on that platform.It was a very different world,and because of that new career opportunitiesemerged, about which we didn't even know.Today it is considered very normal to bea YouTuber or a Gamer, though thereare many families where it is stillnot acceptable. But imagine that in 2005,you go to your parents and say,'Mom Dad, I want to pursue a career opportunity,I don't want to be an engineer or a lawyer,it seems I am reading a movie script,but I love to play games,so I will sit at home and play gameson my desktop, and the world will watchme playing, in fact, they will pay me to play.So, my job would be to just sit hereand play games the whole day and Livestream it,let's not get into the technicalities,I am trying to tell you. And then throughthe Livestreaming people will collaboratewith me for brands, pay me to Livestream,I want to pursue this career'.Your parents would hear you out,their reaction would be...'Stop his pocket money,take away all the phones,there should be no flow of money,he will sit in his room with his booksfor a month and pass this exam,if he doesn't do it then he will sit at the shop,that's it!'The concept of gaming and earning money,the concept of creating content and making money,the concept of an influencer,the concept of a video editor,the concept of a graphic designer,the concept of a meme creator,the concept of app development,the concept of notifications,the concept of so many thingsthat we take for granted today,they did not even exist before 2005,it had no foundation,and all of that happened because of Web2.0,because the whole world got shapedaround the new internet.The same thing is happening with Web3.0.A whole new world is shaping upon the firm basis of decentralization.And this video, which is sponsored by EPNS...And in this video, which is sponsored by EPNS,Ethereum Protocol Notification Service,one of the most exciting projects ofwhich I am also a part,and I will tell you why that is meaningful.I want to introduce you to thosecareer opportunities which may seemto be very childish, very weird,very much in the air right now,but it will be so much in the mainstreamin the next 10 years, that if youdon't stop and think about it today,and make the decision whether youwant to become a part of it or not,then maybe you will miss a train or a bus again.Now, what is happening?Friends, a new internet is in the makingwhich is the basis,and its basis is decentralization,and because of it, many new thingsare created.Imagine that, till now we had companieslike Apple, Google, Facebook which weredoing all the work, now we need todo all the work because there is no company,no CEO, no leader, we have to do allthe work as part of that network,and these things are called projects.There are projects in Web3, for everything.Ethereum is also kind of a project.Bitcoin is also a project.There are many things, EPNS aboutwhich I will talk. is also a project.And the focus of all these projectsis to establish this world of internet,to establish each and everything thatwe need to run the internet.For example,you have a lot of apps on your phoneand you get notifications from thoseapps on a daily basis.Some of them are very irritatingbut some of them are useful as well.So if you placed an order on Zomato or Swiggy,you will get a notification thatthe driver or the rider is on the way,he has reached here, so on and so forth.If you ordered an Ola or Uber,you get a notification.If you have ordered a shipment on Amazon,you will get a notification.Many notifications are only marketing-driven,you don't even want to sign upbut they still keep coming.Just imagine for 1 second,just imagine an app in which thereis no possibility of notification.In fact, imagine that all appsdo not have the concept of notifications,how will that work?You will place an order on Zomato or Swiggy,and then close the app.You will again open the app after 5 minutesto check the status, you will dothe same thing again after another 5 minutes,the same thing again and again,this is still real-time,because you know the order will be therein 30-35 minutes.If you order on Amazon,it will come after two days,but you are in a hurry, because you forgotand you had to order a gift for a friend,so you ordered it last minute.The book has been orderedbut now how will it come?You do not know because there is no notificationso you will, again and again,swipe down and try to refresh Amazon,to check the status, what is thetracking number, where has it reached,so on and so forth.It seems like apps have no purpose,no use without notifications.Now in Web3.0, a new world is in themaking where these apps are being created,but they are not owned by a company.They are not available on Playstoreand App store, they are independent,decentralized apps called D-apps,decentralized apps. But no notificationprotocol or service has beenestablished for them as yet.Imagine that you have a D-appwhich you have made, or you started using it,and there is no communicationthat you get through that app.All your communication is eitherthrough Twitter or Discord or emails.There is no communication that happensthrough that D-app onto your direct walletwhich is your identity on Web3.0.Useless, right?So, EPNS which is Ethereum Protocol...Sorry, Aditya, you will have to cutthe part where, no its EPNS only, sorry,I am sorry, push notifications, sorry,Aditya you will have to cut the partwhere I said that this video is sponsoredby EPNS because I said the wrong full form, sorrySo, EPNS, Ethereum Push Notification Serviceis building that notification service for Web3.0starting with Ethereum.If you have any communication layerwhich requires to be built, then thisEPNS protocol will help you build that,or as a user you can subscribe tonotifications of any service, which is your choice,it will not be imposed upon you, it willbe your choice if you want to receive it or not.Now that is a very exciting projectand when I got to know of it, I backed it.I will tell you how you can also back it up.But what I wanted to share with you is,this is an example of a project whereso many opportunities are emerging whereyou can start participating in the Web3.0 world.If you are already a developer in Web2.0,whether backend or frontend,or you have not yet started your careerbut you have an interest in technology, coding,then these projects are a great way foryou to start getting introducedto the Web3.0 world and imagine thisas a career of choice for you forthe next decade and beyond.For example, on 16th September,EPNS launched its governance.Every project has governance,which means what will be all theoperating rules and regulations of this project?Think of them as rules and policies in a country.Just like there is a mechanism of governancethat you must do this, you must pay taxes,you must follow the rules, like traffic rules,or civil rules, so on and so forth.So similarly, every project has governance.But the best part is that this governanceis not determined by one personor one community, all the ownersof the project determine it.For example, though EPNS is a company,it is 53% owned by the community.A company that is owned by the users,not even employees, to the extent of 53%.That is the fascinating thing about Web3.0.So I am just going through this,and all these links are in the descriptionso that you have a way to startyour journey in the Web3.0 world,but the name of EPNS token,every project can have a tokenwhich in other words is like a coin,just like Bitcoin or Ethereum,similarly, every project can have a token.The name of EPNS token is Push, P U S H.It is available on exchanges,you can buy it, which is the mostfundamental way that you canparticipate in a project.So I bought Push token a while backand that is my way of backing it upand I've been working with the foundersfor some time now to understand it.My knowledge is increasingand they are also getting a little bit of help.But if you want to participatein the EPNS journey,so these are the four rolesthat are available under the governance of EPNS.Push nomineePush delegateePush delegatorAnd Push champions.To know what are these, you can read about them,but basically, imagine that there areroles open in a company where you can apply.The application process will not be throughan interview or job scaling.It is a very standard way of you getting it.With certain eligibility, you can be a nominee,or a delegate, or a delegator, or a champion.And based on that, there are incentivesattached to it. If you are the owner of a token,and when that token rises thenthere is an appreciation in the value,like many people bought Bitcoin in2015 or in 2011, and now the value hasincreased many many folds from thecapital appreciation, so that isa fundamental thing, but beyond that,there is also the incentive thatyou to get because you are workingin these roles.For example, there is something calledRockstar NFT, so on the basis of the workby all the community members, every weeka community member is selected and an NFTis airdropped to their wallet address,which could be anything by an Indian artist.It could be a meme, it could be an integration,it could be something creative, whatever it is,but this is your way of owning an NFTfor absolutely free.You can also take part in governance.There are many roles,as I told you about those four roles.You can take part in the grants programas well which happens through the governance.There are many ways if you want to getinvolved in any project, not just EPNSbut anything beyond those as well, you can.And my humble admission is please try it.This is an early world, extremely fast-paced,yes, it is volatile,there is a lot of fluctuation,but if you are able to get somebasic understanding and grip over thisnew world that is happening in theworld right now, then that will setyou up for the next decade froma career opportunity perspective as well.New roles, new opportunities,new professions are going to emergebecause of this Web3.0 development,and I want that if you are early inyour career game, have some interest in technology,then please give some importance to Web3.0and spent some time on it,because if you do that thenmaybe it can change your whole life.To know more about Push,I have attached many links below.You can buy a Push token.Please do not buy it for the short-term,this is a long-term investment.Buy it and ideally forget about it,just like I have.I have put in my moneyand I have forgotten about it.This is a project that I am backing,which is why I am also making this video,while it is sponsored by the EPNS,and I would recommend you that pleaseread about EPNS as much as you can,please get involved in the project if you can.Governance has been launched on 16th September,many roles are open.And if nothing, then at a basic levelconsider Push as a token in yourCrypto investment strategy.Thank you so much!All the best!Ankur warikoo, signing off!
