I will do the intro and every bitafter our conversation,so I will get straight into it,and introducing you, and get started.Right.Thank you so much Meg for joining us!It's such a pleasure to have youon my platform to spend time with you.I am so happy to be here,thanks for having me!Wonderful!I have to admit, I and my communityare big fans of the bookthat you have writtenThe Defining Decade.It's somehing that I have actively spokenabout in the last several yearsof creating content,so it's a pleasure to have youin person speak in depth about the book.I first have a very honest questionto ask which is,I have seen your Ted Talkwhich starts with the journey of youwith Alex as your first clientand then figuring,'Hey, 30 is not the new 20!'Good memory, yes!So was the book in some waya reflection of how your 20s were,or was that a very dispassionatethird-party observation ofhow 20s should be?Definitely both!I write non-fiction but it's hardto write non-fiction with a voice,if you don't have yourself in there,so when I started workingwith 20-somethings,I had just turned, well I was 29,just about to turn 30,I remember when I turned 30, I felt like,'I can do this, I am 30.'I just felt like I had thisinstant authority somehow,it is great to get out of your 20sin a lot of ways.Well you know, I am a Gen Xers,so we were really the first generation tohit a lot of those adult milestones later,and that has its upsidesand its downsides,and so a part of what I was talkingabout in the book is,what are the some ofthe upsides and downsides,and how you figure out the timing,and what are some of the mythsthat seemed like what could go wrongfor the Gen Xers, but now that we have,you know with millennials and Gen Zers,we are saying,'Well, there may be some other thingsto think about rather than everythingcan happen later.'So it was definitely both.It was not just a memoir.I have seen thousands of 20-somethings,so the courage of my convictions camefrom their lives really maybemore than mine.Got it!And if I were to ask you objectively,how much of that book was somethingthat actually was the wayyou conducted your 20s?Like if I were to set you up foran examination and say,'Hey, what percentage of the 20s wasThe Defining Decade's playbook?'Would you want to has it a guess?I mean, I was in my 20s,you know I think it's tough to bea 21st century 20-somethingand not feel like I have livedall those chapters,and you know some of my moveswere smarter than others.There were some thingsI would do differently,and some things I managed to doquite right the first time.So there wasn't a single chapter in therethat I felt like I have heard about thisbut I can't relate,I mean I have lived it too,but really it is pattern recognition,talking to people,and hearing something over and over,and then you think,Ok, this is important,not just because it happened to me,but because there are all theseother people who were saying,'I am having a hard time,I don't want to talk about this.'That's really sort of what gets meon my soapbox more than my life.I think it's the 20-something,I probably assumed who would careabout my life,but by the time I was in my 30s,and I had listened to so many20-somethings, I thought this issomething to really care about,this is important.Yeah, I love that!The one challenge that I face,and I don't know if,I'm sure you encountered thatquite often is, when someone goes outand says,'Hey, don't think of your30s as the new 20s,the 20s is the defining decade,you need to take ownership,you need to take charge.'It tends to alienate those alreadyin their 30s and 40s and beyond,and they suddenly feel like,'Oh my God, is this like all's lost on usand we can't do anything about it!'What's been the way that you counter that?Yeah, well, you know I did,I wrote the update forthe 10th-anniversary edition,and it was maybe a little bit more clearthat life is not over at 30,that wasn't the point.It was really,'Hey, this is my best advice aboutadult development.It all applies.It's going to apply to your jobwhen you are 40.It's going to apply if you are tryingto get married for the second timein your 50s.But I am just a person who likes toget the message out as soon as possible.But it's interesting,the individual differences.People will write to me and say,'I'm 29, there's nothing I can do,it's too late,I couldn't possibly change now.'And then I'll get an emailfrom someone who is 41 and say,'I read your book,it totally changed my life.'So I think it also says somethingabout the individual that whether or notthey feel like,'Well, I guess I don't have to doany other stuff now because I'm over 30,or I can't.VersusI get it,life isn't that black and white.'I get it.What do you know as someone who isof course academicallyand professionally qualified,to have this observation,nothing of what you have saidin the book is rocket science,if you will forgive me for saying that.Yeah.But there is still so much inertiain people to go aheadand first believe in it,and then act upon it,and it fascinates me,people are willing to give upyears and years of time in justprocrastination and making excuses,as against taking chargeand doing something about it,do you have anything that suggestswhy does it happen?Is it behavioral, is it the environment,is it just the way that the conditioningand the education systemis training us all,what could be leading to thislack of action from them?Yeah, I mean there are a lot of factors,but you know to back up to,it's not rocket science, I totally agree.What I love about workingwith young adults is, you know,sort of the art and the science ofbeing an adult is new to young adults.Like it's not rocket science maybe to meand you at this point,but for someone who is 22,they never really thoughtabout this before,like how do I take ownership of my career,or like how do I go about findinga partner if that's what I want,and so it's interesting that no matterhow many years I have been doing this,which is 20ish now, teaching,working with 20-somethings,there is a new crop every single yearwho are hearing all this forthe first time and it isrocket science to them.And I mean that in likea really amazing, wonderful,super fun way, where it's like,this is super helpful,because they haven't readThe New York Times articlefrom five years ago,that everyone else read,so there's that piece.I just think that to be a young adultin the 21st century,the amount of uncertainty,and the sort of do-it-yourselfthing that needs to go on,is so overwhelming,that people become really stuck,and they are not sure whetherthey should start,they hear that maybe theydo not need to start,and you know human nature,we all sort of secretly wishthat maybe somebody is goingto do it for us,and it will all become clearoutside of us,and then at some point, you realizethat actually you kind of needto decide your own life,or somebody else is goingto decide it for you.I mean it's very overwhelming to bein your 20s right now,there's a ton of uncertainties,you know it's a great timebut also a really difficult time.That's why I have so many clients,it's hard.I couldn't agree more with you.I think this age of abundanceis both an opportunity and a curse,because it tends to make you gravitateeven more towards the conventional choicesand the walked path,because you find a sense of securityamongst all the chaos and abundancethat you feel and experience outside.Wonderful!I have to congratulate you onthe wonderful articulation ofthe term 'identity capital.'When I read that, when I heard that,it just landed so well becauseit just made everything super clearin just these two words,adding value to who you are,which is essentially discovering yourself.And you also made it a point particularlyin the Ted Talk to say that,'Not every exploration is the right one,because there are somethat take you in the right directionand some that don't.'I wanted to get your opinion on somethingwhich is slightly different from,well I shouldn't say slightly,fundamentally different fromthe US cultural context.While in the USa lot of 20-year-olds are like,'Hey, you still have time,30 is the new 20,you don't have to figure things out,you can take these 10 years to figure.'In the Indian cultural context,it's quite the opposite,where there is intense pressureto settle down as soon as you can in life.To quickly get a education,to quickly get a job,to quickly get married,to quickly have kids,to quickly buy that house, that car,and what not,so when I spend time with kids,they are like,'I don't have time to explore.I don't have time to build this capitalbecause I need to finish everythingthat is a milestone set by society.'I would love to get your opinion on itas someone who came up with this idea,and then of course,has suggested others to follow.Yeah, you know I get a lot of emailsfrom India,and I actually really love them.They are all just really lovely emailsfrom very thoughtful people.So you know, I get the struggle.On one end of the spectrum,you have infinite time,and another end of the spectrum,which is oftensort of culturally influenced,if you haven't figured it all out by 20,you are a failure,or that's what parents think.You know I think 'identity capital'is a great concept for peopleto be able to be in the middle somewhere,where you don't have to make one choicethat then you're going to do for 50 years,and then you can be exploring,but adding value to yourselfwhile you are exploring.So you know explorationsthat don't add value in some way,you would really have to convince meas to what you are actually exploringor what is the value in that,but an exploration that adds value towho you are,I think that can feel like explorationand progress at the same time.So some of my clients here,who are from the US,but maybe their parentswere raised elsewhere,that's sort of where they can meetin the middle on,Ok, I understand, you are not goingto have your lifelong careerand your lifelong partner at 22,you are going to explore,but you are not just going to do nothing,and waste your time, and procrastinate,you are out there, building skills,figuring out, and building who are.Then the learning curve in your 20sis really your earning curve in your 30sand beyond,and I mean earning in every way,not just financially,but in terms of confidence,competence, and emotional stability.So I think getting out there,and learning and exploring in a waythat's adding richness,is what would be my hopefor 20-somethings everywhere,and I think you can do thatwithout terrifying your parentsor blowing your life.Wonderful, that's very sound advice!I then go on to the next part ofthe key lesson that you shared which was,leveraging your weak connectsor your weak orbit,essentially just building your tribeoutside of the immediate tribe you have.I've been for the longest timea very strong operant of cold emailing,cold messages, reaching out to people,asking, and I have a life philosophywhich says,if you do not ask,the answer is always no, so please ask.The rebuttal that I often get is,it doesn't always workin the corporate world,while it's nice and fashionablein the startup community,you can reach out to the founders,they are all pretty much the same age,but I can't cold email Google,Facebook, Amazon,I can't cold email General Electric,I can't cold email my way throughbecoming a lawyer, or a psychologist,and so on.And frankly, I am not an expertto answer those questions,but would you have an opinion onwhen you think about leveragingyour weak tribe,does it have limitationsor is it infinite in its possibilities?I think it is infinitein its possibilitiesbecause you can't really see,you know your weak tie iseveryone you have ever met,and everyone they have ever met,so I mean you really can't seewhere all this might lead.Now that doesn't meanthat I can email Elon Musk,and then he is going to make methe CEO of Tesla or Twitter,if that goes through, who knows!It's not like that!But it may mean, I have a friend ofa friend of a friend who works at Tesla,and I am going to reach out there,and that person is going to help myresume get seen, and maybe it works out.maybe it doesn't, but it only needsto work out one time for meto get my one good piece ofidentity capital.And so I am hard pressed to thinkof situations where people got something.Apartments, dates, ideas, job interviews,where somehow the weak tiewasn't involved.And the reason I wanted to putthat chapter in,I had put identity capital and weak tiesin there the first thing,because I know my audience,and if they didn't get further than30 pages before they put the book down,I wanted them to get that,because those are my two bestpieces of advice in terms ofreally transforming your life,I mean really changing it on a dime.But you know, what I thoughtwas important about weak tiesis for young adults to reallyunderstand that what I am talkingabout is not nepotism,because some of thatthat you are going to say to push backsometimes like it's nepotism,that's gross, I don't want to do that.But actually, I am not talkingabout nepotism,I am talking more about crowdsourcing.Not like, my rich uncle giving mesomething I don't deserve,as much as just really having a problem,I need an apartment, I need a new job,putting it out to the crowd,and kind of seeing who can movethe peanut a little bit at a time,and that's usually how it works.Yeah, I want to stress uponthe point that you make.You only need it to work once.You don't have to have a 100% hit rate.Right, a 1% hit rateif you make enough of those.As you said, if you ask enough people,one person will do.You need just one for the job interviewthat gets you thatpiece of identity capital,that opens up new weak ties,and gives you more value,so that the next job is easier,so that it all builds,it's not like you are sort of stuckwith this one little networkyou're trying to work forever.Yeah.That's always very reassuring for peoplewhen they hear that.And that brings us to the third pointwhich is to pick your family.Yeah.And I found that lovely,because I do believe the familyyou are born into and the familythat you pick for yourself,eventually goes on to definea lot of your life,in the way that you think about things,in the way that it just unfolds for you.Again the cultural difference,though it's changing,is the US is almost 100% oflove marriages,high divorce rates, then remarriage,and so on, while India is still largely,this concept of arranged marriages,where your parents are picking upyour life partner,very low divorce rates,that doesn't mean happy marriages,it just means there's a social tabooin going through that,so when you think ofthe cultural context of India,and you still, I strongly believe,would want to endorse picking your familyand going about the right way,what would be your suggestionsfor youngsters, young adultsin this kind of a contextor cultural situation?Right.Again I am thinking of clients I've hadhere who are growing up in the US,but maybe their parents are from India,so they are trying to do that,the intersection of the two cultures.I see all my American friendswho are like,'Don't get married before you are 30.'I mean I have no date on this,this is an individual thing,but you know here,they just date foreverand then eventually it will happen,and then their parents are saying,'No, we've got somebodywe want you to meet.'And so, you know I think there's probablysome wisdom in both models.There are things to take.I can only imagine,people who have been marriedknow a thing or two about being married,and picking out a partnerto go the distance with,maybe sometimes enraged that our friendscan't see into the future ofwhat marriage is really like.But also I think these days,21st-century young adults like to feellike they really own theirown partnerships,they really picked it,they really chose it.Until the idea of picking your family,it came from a saying where people say,'Well, you cannot pick your familybut you can pick your friends.'And obviously, you do pick your familywhen you settle down with someone,it's typically the most important decisionyou'll ever make,because many people want to make itjust one time, so it's a big one.So the 'picking your family'is really about just beingas intentional as you can beabout the process.It doesn't mean that I pick it,and the wisdom of my elderscannot be considered.It just means being intentionalabout what is likely going to bethe biggest decision you will ever make.Makes sense, makes a lot of sense!One final question before we wind up Meg.After almost a decade of writing the book,millions of people reaching outfor feedback,is there anything in the bookthat you wish you could correct,or you feel has changed over the years,that's perhaps come out inthe 10th-anniversary edition?Yeah, yeah!You know I think withthe 10th-anniversary edition what it has,I shouldn't be pushingif you all can get your hands on it,but maybe you will be able to soon,but it has a reader's guide at the back,because a lot of people said,'Oh, this is a big club book,so I want to be able to have questionsand workshops with my friendsor with my book clubs.'So I added that,I did a lot more on social media,and full circle to maybewhat was your first question,I definitely highlighted more of,life isn't over when you are 30.If you are picking this book up at 32,it's still for you, and sometimesthat urgency around like,'Oh my gosh! I need to do this yesterday.'You would be surprisedhow quickly things could change.Some 20-year-olds pick up this book,and they are like,'Yeah, she is probably right,but I have 10 years to work this out.'Whereas a 32-year-old can pick upthis book and say,'Oh my gosh!I needed to do this yesterday,so I am going to do it now.'And I think that's great!Fantastic!I really hope that we can getto lay our handson the 10th-anniversary editionas soon as it's available in the country.Thank you so much for sparing your timethis morning.I enjoyed it, thank you for having me!Thank you, it's always a pleasure!Thanks for sharing your art for your work,and I am a big fan,and I am sure my communityis going to love this conversation.Thanks, Meg
