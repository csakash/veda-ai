Working with creators fora couple of years now,so I visited Tanmay at his place,I visited a couple of creators,Raj and Vandana at their places,and I was speaking with Ankurthat this still doesn't comenaturally to me.I still get the feeling thatI have grown up seeing them.And Ankur is like,You should start to realize thatyou are a part of the system.And he asked me,who is that one creator or artist thatyou would like to meetwho you haven't yet?And I was like, Ritviz.He said, let's make it happen before 2022.And look how that worked out,because I was going throughAnkur's YT video schedule and it saidMeet Ritviz.And I was like,when were you planning to tell us?Shaurya, this is lovely.I am so glad that we are e-meeting.I love it!Do you want to say hi?Come, Aditya.Hello!Hi!Hey Aditya, how is it going?Thank you, yes!You have a tribe in the team, man!Alright, just a couple of screenshotsthat I intend to show.So my top song is Pranfrom last year, 2021.And I am pretty sure that 2022is going to be hogging you as well,and Chandamama is my most-played songof the last 6 monthsI love that!I hope you are enjoying Mimmi,the new album.I am loving Mimmi!I've included Ankur,a couple of questions on Mimmi aboutthe document you need to ask Ritviz.Awesome!Ankur, I don't know if you gotthe chance to listen to the album.I did!Yeah!I was waiting for it.I know this talk show of 2022 is sorted.That's awesome!I am a big fan of your music, man!It's so fresh,and I think you get to hear it so oftenthat it's so different that it's freshin a very authentic way, so I love it!Thank you! That's a very big compliment!Thank you so much! That means a lot!Thank you, man, thanks a lot!I will leave you two to the podcast.Awesome, thank you, guys!Just a second!So what happened is when the albumwas released,Shaurya came running to my room and said,Bro, the album has been launched,come quickly!I hope you guys hada good listening session,and obviously, the album was consumedlike this from top to bottom.I think Ankur,one of the interesting thingsthat happened after the launch,because this was the first timeI was putting out an album,before that I've only been doing singles,but once the album came out,literally after 24 hours,we saw the numbers being consistentwith all the songs,and that was really just showingthat people are listening to thisas an album.It's not like the word of mouth,like you listen to this songor this is the one.You know it's like,we have to go on this journey,so I think that was very interestingand I want to share it with you guys.Love Chandamama, big time!I can't stop listening to it still!More on that, I am sorry, but by the way,I wrote Chandamama for my kids.Yeah.So it's for my future kids,and the idea is to basically instillsome of these values.When you said kids, I was like,has my research has gone so bad!When did this happen?How come this didn't come upin the research?I can tell you so much more,but Ankur I think we can dive into itwhen you want to bring that up,I would like to share so much, man.I'll wait for the recording Ankur.Thank you so much Ritviz.Thank you!Brilliant!Thank you so much for sparing time, man!I'll tell you what the format is.This is a fun conversation.Basically 20 questions,nothing to do with each other,it's not a rapid-fire, so take your time,and answer everythingwhile discussing things,and the idea is to just covera side of you that perhaps peopledon't see very often.So the questions may stump youbut that's by design.Alright, let's do it!Awesome!I'm starting to record.So Ritviz, I'm speaking into my camera,so if I won't be looking at you,you should know thatI am still listening to you.That's ok, cool, yeah!And I will put you on spotlightbecause this is a recording that I'll use.Awesome, great!Are we good to go?Let's do it.In today's video, none other than Ritvizis with me.How are you?Welcome to the channel!Greetings!Thank you Ankur, thank you for having me.Very excited!Very very excited, man!I am such a big fan of your music,and before this conversation,I was telling you what I loveabout your music is,one, you clearly seem to be havinga lot of fun.It is just so visible, and it is so fresh,it is so unique, like within 5 secondsof listening to this sound,people would know that this is Ritviz.And I love that individualitythat you have created.Was it by design?Because I know its EDM, it's Indian pop,there are thousands of thingsthat you can call to name it.How do you brand your music in your head?Ankur before that, real quick,will it be possible to have youin front of me instead of just me,I am so sorry.No, so let me try and figureif that can be done.Hold on.Does this help?Yes, this is good.I just want to see you.I know.Go on.How do you brand your musicinside your head?Very interesting!Already off to a great start here!Ankur, before I even answer this,I am such a big fan,and I follow every single thingthat you post about,and I think it is the kind of motivationthat is more like a mirror,where I think your posts turninto like where I start talking to myself.And I think that ignition,and I think I could maybe try and comparethat a little to my music as well.The minute you forget thatyou are listening to a song,and it is already making you nostalgic,or transcending you into a place,that means the song has now becomea medium.Anyway, I just wanted to say thatI love everything that you post about,and I am such a big fan,and it's an honor doing this.No man, the feeling is absolutely mutual!I love what you said!When you stop realizing thatyou are listening to a songbut it becomes a medium for youto go to some place,as you were describing it,so I could think of Paper Boat as a brand,I don't know why, because it also,I don't know if you've used Paper Boatas a brand or have consumed their drinksbut they also come with very unique onesand their essence is,we'll take you back to your childhood!We'll take you back to those dayswhen you used to eat mangoes, tamarind,lime and sour, and all that,I don't know why,but somehow your musicalways feels like...Exactly!I think the product that we create,the idea is to create an experience.I feel like when you are listeningto my music, I don't even want to portraythat you are listening to a song.For me, it's like you are travelingback in time, the minute the artsort of starts taking birth insidethe listener in a way, and I think for me,the biggest test is Ankur,when I forgetthat I have created that song.Say, I'll work on a song for 5-6 months,but I've seen building blocks,but in the 6th month,I've been hearing it so many timesat such different levels thatin the 6th month,I'm playing these songs on shuffle,and when this song plays,I forget and it evokes a feeling,and I've gone into the listener mode,and I'm like,the song is ready.That's when the song is ready.I love it!On that note, Chandamama is sucha lovely and joyful rendition,what is the inspiration behind it?Chandamama, and I think before thatI have to tell you a little bitabout the album,so Mimmi is my mom's nickname,and I wrote this entire album with her,and I think this entire journeyof obviously me in my 20sfiguring life out,just as any other 20-year-old tryingto figure it out,and just understandingvery important subjects like,what is love?What is this situation?You know, the struggles that we all face,and I think I've taken this journeywith my mom.I think from my days whenI was dropping out of schoolor everything like starting music,having music introduced to me by her,all of this was, I feel like momand I have walked togetherwithout realizing,like I never felt alone, but I was like,I am on my journey, I am doing this,I am doing that.This album was a realization thatI have had support all this while,and the value of support iswhat this album really is.And I think Ankur,I am also only realizingthe value of it now,because all this while, I was thinking,Oh my God! I am doing this,I am doing that, but I never realizedhow I was able to do it.That support enabled me,and I see that as such a huge thing today,because there are immensely talentedpeople out there but maybe thatenvironment is not present,and obviously, in Indian households,as you can imagine, I just told youthat I dropped out of school.Wow!Right, I am telling you,I am very lucky to have the folksthat I have.My folks always argue thatRitviz, you were working 16 hours a day,so you were doing the work,but now I go back to them and say,you allowed me to work 16 hours a day.And I think all of that is peak gratitudethat I've hit with this album,where it's no longer about the subject.We are constantly going to bestruggling withwhat are we figuring with our career?What is our love life going to be like?What are other certain things?But we never realizehow are we able to do all these things.I am sorry, I'll just keep going on.No, I love this!Please continue.So this one analogy thatI kept thinking about while writingthis album was, you know this albumwhere obviously as I am going older,the progression that I am facingas a human,my music is a reflection of that.All the things that all of us face,this is just my POV of that problem.With this album,also there were certain thingsthat were obviously going on,last year there was enough drama,this and that, all of that inspiredthe music that I wrote, only to realizethat the drama is not the focus.That drama is going to be there somewhereor the other always.Like a problem is going to be consistent,it's just going to have a different face.But the analogy basically was,I don't know if I'll do this right,I am very bad with analogies,but I'll try to structure it for you,I hope I make sense,but think of it like I am in a forestand I am looking for a fruit.I am looking for a fruitand I am trying to find it,I am looking for that very epicjuicy fruit out there somewherehanging on a treeand I am trying to grab it,but suddenly, there is a stormlike it's crazy,and now my vision is impaired,and in that moment,I am no longer able to see the fruit,and I come to the realizationthat if I don't have a vision,there is no fruit.So to value my album is basicallyvaluing vision.And in a way, my mom has beena vision for me.To better that analogy,I could have said I was wearing glassesand they fell,and the glasses represent my mom.So for me, understanding thatas long as I have these glasses,I can find different fruits,and let's say, I don't find this today,I'll find something else tomorrow.So yeah, to condense it,this is what I feel the album really is.That is so beautiful, man!I love everything you said!It is so pure.And I often tell people,Ritviz unfortunately,what happens is we can quantifya lot of things in life.We can quantify money, and even status,but the hardest thing to quantifyis luck because it's just so intangible,and the fact that we are bornin a family where we got such parents,we got those kinds of relationships,we got those opportunities,we got those privileges,we were born in this countryat a particular time where everythingjust came together, it is unbelievablehow all that works outto work in your favor.Absolutely!And leading to that, I have a questionfor which I'd love to give you my answerbut I'd love to take your answer.Yes.Is there any ordinary, peculiar, or weirdthing which is a part of your lifethat you think attributes to your success?Something that a lot of people would dismiss, even you might dismiss,but at some level,you feel it has added to your success.Wow, this is such a good question!Ankur, I think maybe over the courseof this entire chat,probably at the end or tomorrow,this is something to think about,this is such an interesting question.I am going to be honest,nothing is coming to me right away,but probably it's sitting somewhere there,I'll have to search for itbut let me come back to this for you.No, because it is very thought-provoking.And I'll tell you because I thoughtabout this a lot and that's whyI asked this question.I feel my last name Warikoo is justso randomly helped me get toa certain point because it is sucha rare last name becausethere is only one Ankur Warikooin the whole worldjust as there is only one Ritviz Srivastavin the whole world,so that already makes you unique,not as an individualbut even as a bloody name,and then it's somethingwhich is memorable.Nobody would forget a Warikooif they meet one,like nobody would forget a Ritvizif they meet one.Fair.This actually helps me.I think maybe I can answer this,I don't know if it fully qualifies,but I think this inspired me tosay one thing.I think for me, it's always beenmy Instagram handle is Vizdumb,it's a wordplay on wisdom,and that was my first EP which I took outin 2014, and I think the essencebehind that name was really enjoyingand valuing the stupidity.I think I really value being stupid,I know that sounds weird,but I think just the fact that,just like that simple programhigh-risk-high-reward,and the ability to take that riskalso requires you to be slightly deluded,it needs you to be emotionaland impulsive, all the negatives,and a lot of times, I do recognize that.And here's the thing,my mom is the most pragmatic personthere is.Dad and I are very similar in our ways,but my mom is very pragmatic,but she understands thathe's very emotionally motivated,and things get him going.And I get so passionatebecause of these ideas thatat the first go could be like,that is dumb!That is extremely dumb!Whatever you are doing is stupid!So, I feel like, I don't knowif this answers your questionbut I feel like being dumb on some levelreally helps in taking those big jumps,because when you are extremely consciousand pragmatic about little things,you won't take those big steps.You'll be like,the stats are low in this.Don't get into the music industrybecause its success rate is low.And then you're like,we're better off from a distance.And then sometimes you don't takethose big steps which are really crucial.Yeah.So, I don't know, I was thinking aboutthis when you were telling your story.That makes a lot of sense.And I'd agree with that.Let's go back because I wanted toask you this question,you dropped out of school,and I love the fact that you attributeso much of it not to your couragebut actually to your parents.Yes, absolutely, they are the heroes.How did that conversation even happen?A lot of my audience is 18-24 years old,troubled by their parents thatI want to do this in lifeand my parents want this,they are not letting me do it,blah blah blah.What would be your advice becauseyou've actually pulled it off?I think for me,as I was telling you earlier,it's the support system.It means so much to me that,for example, if today I'm on Twitter,and I see a tweet, and I've seen myselfget affected by it, a tweet or a commentcould bother me,and I dropped out of 10th standard,after 10th standard,11th grade technically,and my mom is a school teacher,and I left school, stayed at homefor a year, and worked,fully focused on music thatthis is something I want to pursue,every day my mom would come backfrom school and ask me,How's the song going?Wow!And if you think about it,she's at school,there were probably enough peopletelling her things, right?And I think the fact that every nightI never got to hear any of that,so I was in this cocoon,fully motivated with that support systemthat you do you!How is it happening?How is the music coming along?Every single day!So I realize the value of that cocoon now,because today I can see myself gettingaffected by a stupid commentor a little thing,and I've also overcome that,also now realizing thatit's ok, this is also an opinion.But I think my mom whileI was dropping out of school,and already facing that,and both my folks I think havingto face that,but coming home to a bright environmentand a healthy positive like,let's keep going!I think that's what really did it for me,and I think my advice would only be like,if you have this,then count your blessings,and you never really know the value of ittill you also turn into that adultwhen you're like,I'm growing older so I'm also realizing,it's hitting me even harder every day.But I think if you are that luckythen just make the most of it,because if my mom would be herein this interview Ankur, she'll be like,This guy worked for 16 hours!And I am like,Mom, I was but you let me!And I think it really just comes downto this thing.Beautiful!God bless them!It's so rare and so precious thatI wish everyone has thisand you are so blessed to have that.Wonderful!And just to add a little more to that,I'll tell you a little bit aboutour relationship.So I am asocialbut I also don't have friends in general,so my friends are also my folks.So because of that,I think our communication was so strong,we are a very transparent family,so that thing was always theresince childhood,where they were also fully aware thatthis is what he is doing,he seems to really care about thisfor some reason,so that communication even whenthe conversation started being about,Ok cool,I think I am going to leave school, mum.It was never a conversation,it was understood.It was like one day I just stoppedgoing to school,and it didn't feel like they feltany different either,because everyone is expecting it.I don't know but it felt likethe train was on this track only,it never felt like I had takena different route,and I think that's so beautiful.If you have people who are so in tunewith what's going on with you thatyou don't even realize you have takena new path.So that's my parents for you, Ankur.That's incredible, man!But I'd love to have a sessionwith your parents.Absolutely!It will be so amazing for other parentsto hear them out, and also hearabout how they were processingit in their heads, I wonder!Wonderful, man! So commendable!You are really young, and still of course,have so many wonderful years ahead of you,but you also started very young,and that's why you have seena lot already at this young age of yours,my question for you is,How has Ritviz changedin the last 10 years as an individual?In so many ways Ankur, I can't even...I think this question has2 interesting answers.So in a very interesting way,I feel like I have in the classic phraseof full circle,I've seen myself take a full circle,I feel like I am coming back tohow I was maybe 10 years ago.So it's been a full 360 for mein the last 10 years,where I have seen myselfon the opposite endas a completely different person,not holding in regard of any other thingsthat I followed say 5 years agoand 5 years before that,but now 5 years later,and it's been like good 10-15 yearswhere I am like, and I'll explain this,it feels like a lot of things,even with Mimmi, this album,things feel likewe have come a full circle.I think all of the things, for example,when I was in 7th-8th standard,the time when I was first introducedto The H1 Top 40, hip hop,and all of that, and at the same time,I was also learning Indian classical,so these polar opposite worldswere colliding in my head, and I was like,Ok, this is very interesting,but I am obviously pulled towardsthe west,while I am also learning Indian classicalwhich is the roots.So subconsciously a formatwas being formed in my mind,and that is what the music is today.The format could be very west,but the content is obviously Indian,and very heavily rooted,that's one way to describe my music.But I think I was also very disciplinedas a kid,I don't think I cared about anythingbut music,but creative expression in general.I would see myself doodling in class,some sort of expression constantly.I feel like I fell in love with creating.When I first got a chance to create,I was in 5th-6th standard, and for me,good 5 years before that,I was studying Dhrupad,it is north Indian classical music.If you don't know, under North Indian,you have Khayal and Dhrupad.My mum studied Khayal, and I studieda little bit of Dhrupad,which is very traditional in its course,you have to follow,my master would tell me that,I would teach you few tunes of 2-3 ragas,and then you are going to practice thisfor a year straight.So it requires discipline.And the idea is,it's not focused more on expression,it's focused on the skillsthat you polish.Your voice has to reach a certain range,all of this.We would wake up at 4-5 in the morning,and practice the lower notes,and that would go on fora couple of months,till we were even taught to do more.They were like,You just sing these notes.And this is a very strictmaster-student tradition,where I would go to my master's house,do the chores and all of that,so because of thisvery serious environment around music,and obviously me in 5th-6th standard,listening to Linkin Park,all of that is happening,I would listen to Jason Donovanin the bathroom, all of that.I think that really broughtabout this need to express.And whenever I got a chance in schoolor at home,I started formatting certain melodies,I'd find these beats onlineand I'd download themand compose over them,and that gave me a rush.A rush that I'd never experienced,that became automaticallylike just being in that 1-2 hoursof that creative zone, I felt alive.And I think post which everything elsebecame dull.Everything else really felt like...It felt like it was intoxicant of sorts.While I was creating I felt euphoric,and then it reached a pointwhere I was not creative,and I would feel like,Oh my God, what am I worth?!All of that would happen!So I was in this state till about maybeI was 19-20 years old,I stayed in this statewhere I was only focused on writing music,writing stuff, painting,and different kinds of expressions,music just took center stageat a certain point, that's what it is.After Udd Gaye, once we put out Udd Gayeand that obviously blew up,and I felt like,Mum, Oh my God! We made it!This is happening! What is going on?I think post that I had a complete switchin my ways of working.My first switch that happened was like,I am not going to let music guide me.For me, it became more aboutlet's focus on my personal life.Why is it that when I am notin my creative zone,I feel like everything is bad?That is a problem.And I have started recognizing thisbecause every time I would face a block,I would feel depressed, and it's almostas if the music defined mewhich is not true.I am a human first,I need to be that person,and in order to do that,I had to start building my personal life.I remember Udd Gaye happened,and we started playing every show,I'm at every college,I was saying yes to everything,and that led to the block,because I was exhausted, I was saturated,and then I am just like,what is the point when I have lostthe very reason why I started doingwhat I wanted to do?So that first switch happened,and then I went on a 6-month-long break.We put out Udd Gaye, but I didn'tput out the next song,like Jeet came out good 6-7 months later.And the whole reason behind that was,I need time!I need time to regenerate,and to understand why am I doing this!I am not here to please people.I am very grateful that people arelistening to me,but I am not doing it for them,I did it because I thought somethingwas interesting,so let's stay true to that,and start building a personal life.So I think I was 21-22 when I walkedinto my first adult relationship,a semi-adult relationship,I am obviously exploring things.I don't think as a teenager I really,like I said,I was constantly at home in my room,stinking up the place,not taking a shower for 4 days,making sure that my mix is sounding right.So all of those things,I actually faced my 17-18 in my early 20s.At 20-21, I was walking intothese new adult relationships,and obviously, with my folks,we obviously,have a very good relationship,but apart from that,saving a few friendships,because I don't thinkI was the bestest friendduring the time I also wantedto prove myself and all that.So 5 years after Udd Gaye,and we just hit 5 years, by the way,Udd Gaye turns 5 in a couple of days,I had this entire journey ofrediscovering myself and understandingthat music is a reflection of me,it is not who I am, I guess.It's like whatever is going on in my life,like ten years ago I would imagine that,one day this will happen,one day I will be in this situationor that situation,and music was the resultof all those desires.Now the switch turned intowhatever I go through in my life,my experiences are going to be reflectedin my music.So I am not going to chase music,I will let music come to me,and that switch happened Ankur for me,again I feel like,I went in the opposite direction,and now 5 years later,today I feel in a very weird waybecause I am coming full circle,I feel like that's going to bea mix of both because in the last 5 yearsI've also gotten comfortable,where I want to live my life,I want to be a 25-year-old,I want to be a good son,I want to be a good boyfriend,I want to focus on these things,and I've let music come to meand I've enjoyed this process,but I think I'm also reaching a pointwhere I want that disciplinethat I had as a teenager,the fire that I had.I think in a way that's rekindling for me,so I hope I did a good job of explainingto you the whole journey so far,so I'm at a place where I feel likeI'm seeing my 11th-grade me,I'm seeing him and I want to be morelike him in a weird way, but also,I've taken that entire journeyso I have learned a lot on the journey,but I want to be like him.So I don't know, yeah,that's where I'm at.Beautiful, man!I love this!I loved every second of what you said.This is such a journey, man!People aren't able to completethis journey in their whole lifewhich you have unraveledin the last 10 years,and it is commendable thatthe level of self-awareness,and of course how it would have taken,and you of course made it sound very easy,but it would not have been certainlyat any level,but you sound so comfortable with it,it would have taken a lot of courageand my congratulationsfor having done that, man!Thank you!I love this and if I were to paraphraseto give words to your thoughts,you want your music to be a reflectionof you and not your definition.Not my definition, yes!And that is such a beautiful place to be!That is such a commendable place to be!Love it, man!This conversation is so exciting!Are you...Go on!I'm quickly going to switch on the lightsbecause I feel like it's getting dark,just one second and I'm coming backto you right away.Yeah.I think this should be good.This light might be a little disturbing,one second.Even if it happens, don't worry about it.So the discipline that you are kindof getting to now,and you would love to get back to the firethat you had as a teenager,does this make youa routine-oriented person?Yes!You hit the...yes, exactly what!And tell me about,what is your ideal dayor your ideal routine like?If you were to make an ideal Ritviz day,what would it look like?So I come froma family of extreme routines.My dad is a Banker and my mom isa HOD in a school,so it's a very serious routine around me,so I grew up enjoying the chaosthat I built in my life.I was like,ok, in this balance at home,I like to stay in a mess,I like to wake whenever,because I am like,this is what creativity is,it's born out of chaos,like I was under that thinkingnot too long ago,and I think over time,where I am at right now,I see myself turning into my parentsin a way, and I am like,I think that balance...So for example, like this whole thingwhere I was telling you that every timeI face a block,I would feel insecure and I would be like,Oh my God! The world is dyingand all of that!So I think a balance of knowing thata block will only happenwhen you will be saturated.So the idea is not to saturate yourself,and even if you do,block is a natural thing,and then learning thatwhen that is happening,you continue being the human you are.And then all of this I think sparkthis idea that if I wake up at 7and find myself at the gym,which is a wild thought, Ankur.It is a wild thought for a person like me,like I don't know, it's very bad,I never go to the gym, I never findmyself exercising,but the idea of exercisingis really inspiring me to go to the gym,so I am like,this might do things for my day,this might give me a good start.So I am not doing it to become healthy,for me it's like,ok, I could be more efficientin the way I am working.So I think all of those thingsI am going through right now,and you nailed it,routine is exactly whatI aim to come about.Got it! Awesome!And you mentioned that you've recentlymoved to Bombay.Yes.Does this mean that you are stayingby yourself now?By myself now, yeah.Were you staying with your parentsbefore or not?I was in Goa for the last two years.I left the nest around 3 years ago.I left the nest in the pandemic,and I was in Goa for 2 years,2 wonderful years,where I think I basically livedmy college life,I experienced college in Goa.For me, I can look back and say,yup, this was my growing-up phase.And I feel like now coming to Bombay,it really feels like I am turninginto 7th-grade me with all the thingsI picked up,and I think this is post-graduation.Like they say,in every artist's life thereis one album where they adult.Yeah.And I have a feeling,and I could be wrong,I feel that Mimmi is your adulting album,where it will change you forever,and you will always reflect back on this,and realize,Oh my God,this was like a defining moment!It was a defining moment!So excited, man!Awesome!One thing about your routineor rather the opposite of that is,is there an undesirable partabout your day which you just have to do,because you are Ritviz, and now Ritviz,not the guy that you could be,but now, Ritviz, the public figure,the personality,or maybe something else that you do?Is there an undesirable partabout your day?I hate to say this because this isa very important part of being Ritviz,but I think the travel that is involvedaround the shows that I do,I don't enjoy traveling,I think maybe that's also,I have also started to look at it aswhy don't you enjoy it?There is a fix to this.If you initiate a certain routine.So that's how I have startedseeing it now,I am definitely seeing it differently now,but in the past, even in the pandemic,right before the pandemic hit,it was intense, Ankur,we were doing college rounds,3-3 shows a week,and when the pandemic hit,I don't want to sound insensitivebut at that moment I was like,I'll get to stay at home now.And obviously, I was privileged enoughto say that, but for me, it was like,Oh my God, I am getting a chanceto now settle down.I think Mimmi was also a product of that.I got so much time to myself, to reflect,to do these things,I think I am still very gratefulfor the life that I am going out thereto perform for thousands of peoplewhich is a dream of mine,it was an absolute dream,and I will forever be grateful.But those 23 hours to one hour on stagewhich is all worth it,the 23 hours of anxietythat I'm in the city,I am not even looking outside my window,if it's 3 shows thenthere is a lack of sleep, all of that,that is for me,the travel is undesirable for sure,but like I said,I have started seeing things differently.So let's see Ankur,let's do this again in 5 yearsand see how I am.I know, exactly!You may have a very different realizationand I love this journey that you are on.Is there a dream venue to perform atfor Ritviz?My hometown.I am from this place called Darbhangain Bihar, this is a small town in Bihar,I was born there.I didn't stay there much longerbecause I think I was born thereand then we moved to Patna,I was there for like a year or two,and then I lived and grew up in Pune.So technically, I am a Pune boy.But my hometown is Darbhanga,and we are playing our first showin Bihar next January.In January 2023, we are doing our debutin Bihar, in Patna.I hope that one day I can doDarbhanga too.I am sure it will happen!Awesome, man!One question before I go intothe final 3 questions,the rapid-firish ones.Yeah.If you think about your life right now,and of course, it has come withits share of love, appreciation,but also doubts, uncertainty,so it's like a mixed bag which happenswith everyone,what is the one thing thatyou would actually...What's the one realizationthat you've had that you now knowyou thought was true but is not anymore,like it was almost like a liethat you were believing or the worldhad told you when you were growing up,and now you realized it was a lie,it was never the truth,but who knows why people used to sayor why I used to feel like this?Yeah, I think this thinking of the factthat there is a top of the mountain,I think that was my biggest lie thatI am working towards climbing this,and I think what I learned is it'sa never-ending checkpoint,it's just checkpoints.You reach a certain pointand you are like,Oh my God, I made it!But after 5 minutes that becomesyour new normal and you are like,I am still facing the same thing.The problems don't go away, money,success, all of this was not the answer,because that was not the questionin the first place,and I think that for me wasa big realization, very big,and I am very glad thatI learned this also...You got stuck and now you are back.I don't know, I kept going.I was saying I think we expecta moment to solve us,but it's actually the journeythat is supposed to be...right?Because so many times, I feel likewhen I look back there was so much timethat I have also just given to like,Oh my God,I am looking forward to the 25th!And I am just going to nailthe 25th of this month.And for 25 days, I don't knowif I've even paid attention to thingsthat actually got me to the 25th.So that was my thing.It's beautiful, man!You know your responses Ritviz,I am 42,so I consider myself extremely privilegedand very humbled that I gotto live the life that I have,the experiences that I have had,and so many things, and when I hear you,you are what? 26?Yes, 26.It is incredible, and I don't say thisbecause you are in front of me Ritviz,I say this because I have got to knowof this about you right now,at 26 you are so wise for your agebecause you have put yourselfon this journey of self-awareness,that my prediction is at some pointin time, your music will begin to,if not already, heal people in waysthat you do not even imagine right now,and because your music,if it continues to beand I am sure it will bea reflection of your thoughtsand your experiences,it will get to a pointwhere people will not justentertain themselves,or feel happy about themselves,or feel good about life,they will actually save themselvesthrough your music,and it's so wonderfulthat you are on this path,and I am so excited for you, my friend.Thank you!I feel very privileged to talk to you,and I also find myself talkinglike this when that connection builds,and I think only then that,so thanks to you for also having me.No, you have opened up so wonderfully,and I'm so glad to see this side of yours.I've seen a different kind of appreciationfor your music in the last 40 minutes,which of course, is so fascinating.Great!3 questions Ritviz,and then we will bring this to a close.Rapid-fire,whatever comes to your mind first.Money or power?I think power, although both havevery serious connotations,I think I will choose power over money.Fair enough, awesome!Speed or perfection?Perfection.I would have guessed that much.And what do you think will bethe most expensive thing that Ritvizwill own in his life beyond real estate?I think, to be very honest,all of these learnings.I think that will bethe greatest asset to apply,help me figure out the decisionsthat will involve hopefully, money,or anything else, relationships, yeah.Beautiful answer, man!That's the best answer I've ever got.Great, thank you so much Ritviz!Thank you Ankur!More power to you!Your music and everything you do makesa difference, and I hope thereis never a day when you wake updoubting why you are doingwhat you're doing, because there area lot of people who benefitfrom what you do,thank you so much for that.Thank you so much Ankur, this was lovely!Thank you for having me!Thank you so much, man! Bye!Awesome!That was amazing!This was really good, man!
