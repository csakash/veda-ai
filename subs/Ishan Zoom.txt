Check 1 2 check 1 2 okAudio is recordingand video is also recordingOk, awesome, great,let's get started, and...In today's video,I have Ishan Sharma with me,who is such a terrific YouTubersimply because I thinkhe's cracked his gameearlier than most others,and is doing itso commendably wellthat I've looked at himand I've only been inspired.So in today's video,I wanted to havea conversation with Ishan onwhat are the legit income streamsthat a student can have?Ishan was a student of BITS, Goa,when he started this entire journey.Now he has gone toa very different level,but he understandswhat are the constraintsin a student's life,what opportunities are possible,and after combining them,how can you actually startearning even before you havea full-time job,should you want a full-time job?So thank you so much Ishaanfor joining us.This conversation will bereally lovely,I am glad that you couldspare time today, man.Thank you so much Ankurfor inviting me here.Really excited to be hereon your channel.And yeah, I have hadan amazing experience ofmaking money throughthe skill that I already have.The last three years have beenall about upskilling myself,and then investing all of my timegetting more clientsand working with themand creating a revenue stream basically.And along the way,I have seen ton of peopledo the same thing,and I have also hiredover 10-15 different freelancerswho are all in collegeor even are teenagersearning money in the school itself.It's a really interesting fieldthat people can get into,and they can learn the art of,first of all, upskilling themselves,and then selling themselves,or I should say,selling their skillsto the potential employeror the clientthat they want to pursue.It's an amazing field,they should definitely get into it,and they will learn a lot morethan what they would in their lectures.The last one was absolutelyfrom the heart.It was a dropout's feeling.But walk us through the journey, man,not that my audiencewouldn't know about you,but for those who may not knowabout your journey.I am interested especially in 2 things.One is at what pointas a student Ishaan,did you realize that collegemay not give you all thatyou have thought about,and you'd have to do somethingbeyond that?And was it natural or easyfor you to follow this pathof content creationas the first way of creatingyour personal brand?Sure.Just a minute, my SD card...I know, take your time.It says only one minute is left,how can I tell everything in a minute?Say everything in a reel.I will just transferall the content in this.I recorded a lot of vlogs there.Yes, I can imagine.Aman bro talks very well.He is actually like a brother only.He gives you a perspective,if you want to earn â¹1,000in a day, what is it thatyou have to do?Just have a normal job.If you want to earn â¹10,000in a day, what is it thatyou have to do?And that's how he goes on basically.I am just transferring the content.It's ok, don't worry.I just hired someonewho would be making threadsfor my Twitter.So it's basically my own videosand they will be convertingthe video content into threads,so it's nothing new for me,it will just take more time,and then it will get betterfor her also, she will alsoget to learn a lot,and she's just 17.Oh wow, man!Where are you doing most ofyour hiring from,YouTube, Instagram?Yes, I just email asking peopleto email back as I'm lookingfor an assistant or something.I am still looking foran assistant.I don't get it!Like I got to meet some peoplewho are 26-27,and I got intimidated abouthow can I hire elder people!So I tweeted that it feelsweird hiring people olderthan me, but 21-22-23,but 27?!Oh God, it's crazy when yousay 27 is old,which is old for you,I can imagine.In our team, I just hiredsomeone who is 18and I think the oldest is 30.So yeah, 18-30, but most of themare between 22-24.Right, so I'm just tryingto understand,will they be the right fit or not?Someone was just like I have my own job,I will do part-time with you.I said, how is it possible?But why do need an assistant?All the tasks, like talking to a brand.The brand guys wantme to share the number,I am sharing my numberand doing negotiations with them,like I would do it 60, not 50.Ishan, my suggestion for thatwill be to get someonewho has the experience,and is around the age of 26-28,because then two things will happen.One is that person would havethe knowledge onhow to conduct themselvesprofessionally in front of largely brands,even if they have to write an email,then it should be written properlyand not in the GenZ language.GM!Exactly! TC!So, all that won't be there.And secondly, they will also earna certain level of respectbecause money is involved.If they would 'young kids',then they can easily be crushedbecause negotiation isa very different art,and that's why it will be hardfor someone who is very young to do it.Right! Just a minute.You can do one more thing,which I don't know if you havedone it or not.Make your price list for every quarter.Price list.And don't move from that price list.Understood.So do you increase your pricesevery quarter or how is it?Every quarter,whatever the follower growthon the platform is,that increases the price.Because I have worked witha lot of brands and agencies now,almost everyone who's workedwith us knows that our priceis only one price whetheryou take it or not,we have no problems.And that eases up so much,so much of back and forth negotiations.They ask me,the way they talk to me is like in a shop,Is it Ishan Sharma from YouTube channel?What is your price for one reel?I said, this doesn't work like this.Which brand is it?What is the brief?When will it be posted?Right.They want to know everythingbut they say,'It's an ed-tech brand.'Exactly!'We can't tell you the name,it's an ed-tech brand.'It's confidential.And it's not confidential,it's just that that brandwould be with every agency,and if they reveal then...And they also knowthat a lot of creatorsare now directly going to the brandsso it's just crazy there.But the problem wasthat I recently got to meetthis company called Mudrex,you know.Yeah.It's like a mutual fund for Crypto,and basically,I met that guy at dinner,and I asked him to connect.Edul Patel?No, I spoke with Nitish,he asked me to do a podcastwith him later.So basically, I referred thatto my agency.My friend had an agency so he said,'I want Mudrex so connect me with it.'I connected them and he basically quoted,he placed me through his agency that,'There is a campaign by Mudrex,shall I take it?'I said OK.He asked, how much will it charge?I said, the standard charges,1 lakh is what I charge foran integration.So he was like,'The brand can only pay 60,000.'I said it's too less.He said,'Take 65, the brand cannotpay more than that.'I directly reached out tomy friend in Mudrex, I said,'Bro, I want to do the integration.'He said, 'Yeah, tell me.'I said, 'I will do this videoand I will charge 1 lakh.'He said ok.He said,'Shall I make the payment in Crypto?'I said, sure.I sent him my wallet address,and before the video,the payment was done.Now I am thinking, that personcharges so much commission!He didn't negotiate at allwith the brand!Something was fishy!So I feel that there isno transparency in the agencies.Yeah, that's the problem.I will record it from my phone only.Ok.Let's begin or continue.Cool, alright.You asked me a question.I'll ask it again.Alright.So Ishaan, first of all,I would like to know,at which point in timedid you realize that evencollege would not servethe purpose for which you went there,and you were in one ofthe finest institutions in the country,and if you had this disillusionmentat that point also,then it must be somethingthat provoked it,so what happened that made you feelthat you would have to stepout of the college experienceto take charge of your own?Yeah, totally.When I was in my coaching,my coaching institutehad sold me a dream,that now is the time to study,and college will be all about fun.And that's what I thoughtit would be, right.I thought it would be justan amazing experience.I was really interestedin quantum mechanics.I used to look at that courseof MIT on the same.So I went there,I went into my college,first of all, I wanted to go into IIT,I didn't get it because of my rank,so I got into BITS,because I attempted the BITS site,and I got a good rank, so I got in.After going there,I realized that the peoplearound me are amazing.The professor, the topicsthat they are talking aboutmaybe don't relate to meor what I want to do,and it gets boring after a point.Like a slide show is going on,one ppt after the other,the professors are reading the PPTand they are just saying,'Any questions? No questions.Ok, let's move ahead.'It sort of gets boringbut I completely understandthat's how things arein most engineering colleges.I am fortunate to be ina college that allows me topursue things other than just studies,so we have this 0% attendance policy,and because of that,we can focus on whatever we want.Most colleges havea 75% attendance policyso they have to come to the classes.So we can properly focuson doing whatever it is that we like.So that's when I realized that,I would not enjoy only college study.Maybe I had this dream of gettinginto Google, or the fan companieslike software developerswhen I first got in,and of course, it has changed a lotas I have progressed,as I have matured,as I have learned more abouthow the world really works.So I learned about this thing,and I thought that this is the timefor me to learn skillsas much as possiblein the first year of college,when everyone else waslike partying, having fun, you know,doing all sorts of new things,because they have been onlyfocusing on IIT-JEEfor the past two years,and I could finally focus on doingwhat I actually wanted to do,which was programming,which was learninghow social media really works,content and code is what I focused onin the first year itself.So my whole journey was about that.I found out that if you canupskill yourself,and you can havethat delayed gratification,like ok I can sit on one course,and I can listen properly,I can make notes,I can revise,and I can implement thaton building somethingthat could be a design,that could be a project,and I can then start selling my skillsto other people in college itselfand I can earn a living through that.My thinking was simple, right.My parents were about to takea loan for my education,and I thought, first of all,they wanted me to get into IITwhich didn't happen,now they are payingthis ridiculously expensive feesof my college, that is BITS Pilani,and now I have to justifythat cost somehow, right.So I thought it would be amazingif I can pay my own college fees.I used to follow a lot ofYouTube creatorsand they used to just say that,'I pay my own college fees,I pay for everything that I do.'These are mostly in the US.I got motivated by them and I thought,how can I do something similar?So I upskilled myself a lot,that's the first and the mostimportant part that I would telleveryone who's watching this video.Your full focus should be on,how can you learn a new skillthat will make you irreplaceable?So you need to focus onthat one thing itself.I knew that code wasthe important thing right now,that's what scalesand that's what companiesare willing to spend the most money on,so I learned that first of all,and that also helped me later onin my journey.So that's basicallyhow my journey started.And then I, of course,consumed a lot of content ofGarry B about,how can you create a brandof yourself online?How can you grow on social?So I started with Instagram,I started with my podcast on YouTube,and that's how things went in 2020,and here we are.I know, here we arewhere impressively you have doneso so so awesome, man.It's really good tooto see your journey.I remember this,when I came to your podcastfor the first time,I didn't frankly realize it,but when I came for the second time,then you shared that,you were very nervous,and this is not your natural self,and you had to work a lot on yourselfto get comfortable with this.Was content creation,which is a brilliant income stream,especially for a student,if it wasn't natural,what was in your mind Ishan,that I want to experiment in thisor I want to see how far can it go?You know from the beginningwhen I was in the 10th standard,I went to my class thereand I was doing really well in biology,and I was like this one personwho knew more about biologythan most of the students in the class,and my teacher used to love me for that,the knowledge that I had.But then what happened isthat I had to make a decision,do I want to take PCMor do I want to take PCB?I was horrible in mathematics,but I thought, let me tame the beast,let me take the harder choice,I wanted to just see how hardcan it actually be,so I chose math because that's whatI was the weakest at amongall of the subjects,and I went ahead with that.So my mindset has all beenabout taking the hard path,and you learn along the wayhow it really works,and you figure things out.Now when I started content creation,before that I had this one hackathon,a hackathon by Microsoft happenedin our college,and I built somethingwith my college friend, my roommate,and then we started to pitchthat to the judge,and I realize that I was not ableto properly explainwhat I have built in the last 24 hoursto the judges,and that was a horrible feelingin my mind.I was just like, what have I done?I have been making it forthe past 24 hours,why was I not able to properly explain,not able to properly sellthat to the judge?So I thought that I have towork on this thing.How can I do that?I am not having the financesto go for those expensive appson which you meet peopleand learn English,and how to speak it online,there are bunch of those appsout there.So I thought one good waywould be to start making videos,or just talking to myself.So I have this unlisted linksof videos that I recorded,and I used to be just like,ok this is what happened today,this is what I was thinking,this is what I felt,this is what the professor did,this is how much marks I got,this is what I am feeling about it.And I just did that for,I think 5-10 weeks, right.And then I was like,let me try to talk to myseniors in my college,they have some great experiences.So, one guy was in the second year,and he was interning at Harvard.One guy was building theirown startup, gettinga Thiel fellowship.One guy got accepted intoY Combinator with a startup.Really interesting people,amazing stories,and I thought I would talk to them,learn about their stories,and also record this,and then share that with everyone,because not everyone knowsabout all of these things, right.That's the gap that we are tryingto bridge as content creators,you would also agree with that.So I did that.Every week I used to haveone video on Sundays,and then slowly I realizedthat after the pandemic started,I realized that I could actuallyrecord videos,I could talk to the camera,and I could upload that as wellon the weekdays itself,so that it would drivemore attention to my channel,and then ultimately peoplewould want to look atthe Sunday videos,so those were the long-form podcaststhat I used to do with people.That's what I did,and I made this disciplineof uploading one video every 2 days.And I am following that evento this day after 2 years.So I started in January 2020,and here we are in 2022,so I have been at it forthe past two years,and I can really seethe compounding gains,both in the numbers as well asin my own speaking skills,in just everything in my lifein general basically.So I have learned a lotin the whole journey.Fantastic!I am still in the third year.I know, exactly! That's what?You are still a student,and you have left your collegeaverage placement far behind.You are way ahead,and you are living lifeon your own terms.You can spend your timeand money wherever you want,you have the libertyand the freedom to do thatwhich is so so liberating.Amazing, man!And Ishan, while you wantedto pay for your own college fees,and that was a desire,at what point in timedid you feel that it has becomea reality now,like now I would be ableto give my own college fees?Sure.So I think it wasthe middle of 2021.Before that, I haven't doneany brand sponsorships, right.I was just like,I should not do this,it won't be right.But then I did a bunch of surveyswith my own audience on Instagramand on YouTube.I asked them,How many of these can I actually do?What would you be comfortable with?And they said, as many as you wantas long as you are being authenticwith yourself and with your audience.So I thought, why not talkabout the brandsthat I normally use every single day,that have helped me to becomewho I am today.So that's what I did.I would just reach out to brandsand I would be like,'Hey, I have been usingyour application for thelast two years,I would love to talk aboutit on my channel,let me know if there can bea fruitful collaborationpossible here.'And they would be like,'Sure, let's try it out.'And that's basicallyhow all of this started,and that's when I realizedthat right now I am ableto make enough thatthe top package in my collegewould pay, and that's whenI thought that this isthe time for me to startpaying my fees,and I think that was 2:1,basically the first semesterof the second year.So since then, I have been payingmy whole fees.Parents are really proud of whateverI have been able to do,that's why they also agreedwhen last month I droppedout of my college,they agreed for that,and they said,'I see that you are focusingon this for the last two years.You are committed,and you can do something bigwith this channeland with the agencythat you are trying to build.'So they went ahead with my decisionto drop college and focustotally on content as well ason building my business.Fantastic, man!We've caught you at the right time.It's like a seed was sown,small offspring was visible,this is the moment, April 2022,Ishan has just droppedout of college, going full timeinto what he loves to do.And in the next 3-5 years,the world will see a completelynew vehement coming out,and I am so excited for that, man!Brilliant!So in all your experience Ishan,if you would have to createa kind of a playbook for students,not necessary that whateverhas happened in your lifewill be exactly what happensin their lives as well,but there are a lot of experiencesthat can be drawn upon,what would be your waysthat you would recommendstudents of India in collegeto start building an income stream,which can make themfinancially independent?Sure, definitely, I will talkabout all of these ways.Before that I would liketo tell everybody,to all the audiencethat before you think about this,just realize that you watcha lot of people on YouTubetelling you how much moneythey make, there area lot of videos like that on YouTube,but don't compare their journeywith what you are at right now.There is a quote that says,Don't compare their day 600with your day 6.So you have to understandthat very important thing.A lot of people see that someoneis making a crazy amount of moneylike in crores,and then they realizethat even if they go throughtheir IIT-JEE preparation,even if they get intothe best engineering colleges,they get the best international package,they still would not be ableto make that much,so they end up just like dropping out,just doing nothing,and that's not what you should be doing.You know, the only thingthat IIT-JEE taught me wasthe hustle mindset.Just sitting at one problemand solving that for hours on end.And that is what I havetaken away from it,and that is what helped me doall the things that I am doing right now,and there is no race in life,that is also really important.A lot of people think that,'Oh, this one achieved so muchat the age of 18 or at the age of 20,I should also do the same.If I am not achieving it thenI am not doing as well asthe other person, I am unsuccessful.'So that is what youshould not be focusing on.Now keeping all of thoseimportant warnings aside,let's talk about the 10 waysin which you can earn asa college student.Number one would be to lookat the creator economy.There was a recent statisticsshared in which it basically said thatit is 100 billion dollar economy,and you have tons of opportunities,even Ankur would agree to that.And first of all, you know,you can start out asa social media manager.All the creators out there,even brands out there,need someone who understandsthe platforms better than they do.So if you know how Instagram works,if you know how Twitter works,if you know how the YouTube platformreally works, the algorithm,and what type of content workson this platform, you can pitch in,sell yourself and sellwhat you can actually deliver,and just be authentic aboutwhat you can do with the accountsthat you would be working on.And when you do that,they will have to see your credibility.So you have to have some sortof a portfolio that you canshow to them.And then once you are donewith that, you will definitelybe able to get a ton of clients.Right now, all the businessthat I get in my agencyis just because of the metricthat I have on my YouTube channel,and they can see that ifI can build my own,I can do something great withtheir YouTube channel as well.So focus on that if you wantto start out as a social media manager.There are tons of opportunities,you know, I see a ton ofthese 17-18-year-olds,I met them recently at an event,and they said that,'Hey, I am managingsocial media handles,Instagram accounts of like800,000-1 million followingaccounts as well.And all of that was possiblebecause they were learninghow the platform works,and they had some past portfoliosto show to them.That's the number one thingthat you should be focusing on.That's social media management.Number 2, as I talked aboutinfluencers and creators in general,you can start by becoming a managerfor all of them.Right now, I am also looking for one.So basically one personwho you can just reach out to,and who can help you with allthe backend things,like you know, booking a flight,scheduling all the meetings,talking with some brands,getting the sub-content done,it's sort of a generalistic rolethat people can do.So if you are good at talking,if you are good at writing,just good at doinga lot of different things,then you can try to pitchin yourself, and you can workas a virtual assistant.That's going to be number 2.You can do this for businessmen,you can do this for creators as well,and the sky is the limit over here.There are a lot of websiteson which you can just go,and in that case, you will bepaid per hour, and when you dothat you will be workingfor people that are outsideof India.So it just matches you with someonewho wants to hire you asa virtual assistantand you will be working for them.There are lots like them,like in the Philippines,and Thailand, there area ton of these people who workas virtual assistantsand they are able to makea living doing that.So that's how that works.A virtual assistantis definitely somethingyou can start out with.If you are just a studentyou can do it part-time,maybe for 4-5 hours every single day,and you can gain experienceworking with someonewho is big either in businessor as a creator.That going to be number 2.Can you hear me?Yes, very well.Alright, let's talk about number 3.So the third way of making moneyis to start learning video editing.This is something thatI have done myself as well.I've edited over400-500 different videoson my channel and for the brandsthat I have worked withas a freelancer.And so, you need to basicallylearn the tool,and then you need to learnhow the tool can help you creategreat storytelling videos.I should actually start this again.The third way to make moneyis to start editing videosfor brands as well as for creators.I have seen huge opportunitiesin this space.I personally have hired10 different video editorswho work with us,and all of them are college students.They go to the college in the noon,and once they get back in the evening,they work with us,and they edit videos all the time.So it is a great field.You can work as a freelancer,you can contact brands,and the videos of brandsare not that well-edited,you can just pitch themand you can say,'Hey, I know howthe YouTube platform works.I know that fast edits is what works.I know that memes are what really works.I can help you to createan engaging video.'And so basically,whenever you are editing a video,you have to focus more onhow can you make it interactiveand engaging,so that the average viewduration of the video increases.That's the metric that most peopleare looking out for, for whatevervideo that they are tryingto edit and create.So that's you should be focusing on,and do that with the helpof DaVinci Resolve,Adobe Premiere Pro,and Adobe After Effects,and you can create a very engagingvideo with the help of that.You can learn all of these thingsfor free as well,or you can get it throughaffordable courseson various different platforms,and you can start upskilling yourself.So that's going to bethe third way to make money,editing videos,that's what I have tried.A bunch of people that I have hired,they are also doing the same thing,and it works really well,they are easily able to makeâ¹60K-80K per month as well,that's what we pay to the peoplethat we work with,so they have this freelancer basis,so someone is like editing50-100 different videosand they are getting paidabout â¹60K-80K per month as well.So a great field for you toexplore if you have the time,and if you are patientto learn how videos can be edited,and how can you make them engaging.That's number 3.Number 4, I think you canstart learning how design works,just going back to upskillingyourself.Learn how design really worksand how can you start creatingthumbnails as well as startmaking IG carousels.So, thumbnails area really interesting fieldbecause here it's a lot lessabout designs, it's more aboutthe psychology.If you can understandwhat is the psychology ofa user who is scrollingon YouTube, and what arethe things that they areattracted to,then you can make somereally interesting thumbnails.And the way YouTube works is that,if you have added one thumbnail,and if you change that,and if it just works,if the CTR, Click Through Rategoes more than like 2-3%,then the difference inthe video views can be substantial.So that's what I have alsonoticed on my own channel.So this is a great thing thatall of the big YouTube creatorsare looking out for.It is also called re-indexing,just change the titleand the thumbnail,so it works really really well.You can start with Canva,you can also go to Photoshop,and you can start exploringhow thumbnail design really works.It's all about experimentation,that is what I have also learnedin my whole journey.So that's going to be one thingthat you can do.You can also learn abouthow to create Instagram carouselsor just carousels in general,or you can also createpitch decks for people.The way this works isthat you need to learnabout this thing calledthe AIDA framework.Imagine that 10 post carousel,the first page has tohook the audience.So how can you createthat right messaging?That could be through fonts,that could also be through images,and that could be alsothrough illustrations.How can you hook a personin with the help of that?And the next thing iswhen you build upthat whole curiosity of the person,and then at the end,you give them the answerthat they are looking out for,and at the very end is your CTA,that what is it thatyou want them to do,and that's basicallythe AIDA framework.I love this, I read this fromthis person called Chris Dowho I look up to a lotin the design field.He is working in the USas a designer,he has his own agency,so a lot to learn from him.But this is one thingthat you can start out with.You can charge a lotin thumbnails if you knowhow the platform really works,if you have some experience.You know, just when youstart you can charge anywherebetween â¹500-1000 per thumbnail,and it works really well.Of course, you can also gowith IG carousels,and that can also be one waythat you can become a designerfor social media accounts.The fifth way to make moneyis to learn about SEO.So, learn how SEO works,you can do that on YouTube,you can do that for blogs,and once you knowhow to create highly optimized content,then you can go and apply that for blogs,you can do that for writing subtitles,for writing descriptions,you can do that for Twitterthreads as well, you can dothat for a variety of different things,but once you know how to createan optimized content piece,then you can potentiallyjust pitch it to a bunchof different clients.I have interviewed two peoplewho work as content writerson Fiverr itself, and they are ableto make more than $400,000 everysingle year doing just that.So, all they really do isthat they ghostwrite articlesor even ebooks for some peopleon the platform,and they are able to makea decent living doing just that.So it's a great opportunity hereas well as for a content writer.Start learning it,start understandinghow organic search really workson YouTube as well as on Google,and you will be able to getinto this field very easily.Alright, how is it going so far?Really good, I mean you are...Take a breather.Yes, I will just get some water.Yes, please.Just a minute.Sure.In December I made a video titled,21 ways to make money for students.So I went through it one by one,and I told them that there isa document in the description below,and all the resources are givenout for free access.Awesome!I will tag that video here.For 11 more ideas.If this was not enough.I know.Cool, alright!Let's talk about the sixth wayto make money as a studentand that would beto get scholarships.So you can either make moneyor you can save your parents' money,or your loan, or whatever it isthat you're paying from yourown account with the help ofgetting scholarships.So I know that in my college,there is this thing calledMerit-cum-Needs Scholarship.My roommate also has it.So the way this works isthat they will be a certainthreshold of your householdannual income,and if that income islesser than that,then you end up gettingthis particular scholarship.So it is a great thingthat you can definitely approach.Now if it is above thatthen you need to be greatat your studies,you need to be greatat getting a great CGPA,and that way you will getsome amazing scholarships.I know in my batch thereare people who are getting 100% waiverin their tuition feesbecause they are able to get 9.8-9.7 CGPAin their studies,but they are also spendingthe majority of their timedoing just that,so I don't know if that workswell or not.Wow!So that's one way that you canstart by getting scholarships.These are just college-based scholarships.You can also apply fora variety of different scholarshipsthat are not from your college,and that way you can get paidfor studying basically,they will take care ofall the expenses thatyou normally have.So that will be number 6.Number 7 is to start makingwebsites and start making appsfor the all of the brands out there.There are many normal stores inyour own college or your own town...The seventh way is to startmaking websites and appsfor businesses or even for startups.So you will find a lot of businessesin your own town who aretrying to get online,and they want someonewho can create responsive websitesas well as apps that gets themon in the digital space basically,and they would love to pay youhandsomely for doing that.If there is like a shopthat you can go to,like a supermarketand you can just say that,'Hey, I will get youon this platform,I will get you on Google Mapsso that people can recognize you,and they can get to you,and that will increase your sales.'So always think about,how can you pitch them asthe end product,that I will do this this this,but at the end,it will impact your salesby this much,or it will help you getmore footfall in your particular mallor whatever place that would be?So you can do that,you can try to create websites.Now the way that works is that,you can either learn abouthow WordPress works,and you can learn abouthow different elements are,how other themes work,or what you can also do islearn to code yourself,and start building websitesfrom scratch.So, there can be both of thesethings that you can do.If you don't want to code,if you just want to usedrag and drop tools,you can do that as well.The problem is that most peopledon't really know about theseopportunities that theycan still use WordPress,they can use a bunch ofother websites that enablethem to build their own websitesfrom scratch.So you can take advantage of that.It's all about taking thearbitrage opportunity,and start making websitesand apps for the businessesaround you.So that's how that works.The 8th way to make money would beto start participating in hackathonsor bug bounty programs.This is a little niche.If you guys are engineers,if you are pursuing engineering,if you are into programming,there are many hackathonsin your city,or you can go to Devfolio,it is a website that you can visitand you can see there,which hackathons are going to happenin India, many of them aredone virtually these days,few of them are in personwhich you can go and attend.So basically here, they giveyou 24-48 hours,and they basically saythat this is the main project,this is the theme,and you need to createyour own project using that.So that's how you can startbuilding your own project.Then you pitch it to the judgesand if they like it,you will end up winning some prizes,you can end up getting fundingfor your project as well,and if not you will anywaysget free food as well asa bunch of T-shirtsand other swags.So it's definitelya win-win situation for everyone.So that's hackathons.You can also take partin bug bounty programs.So, what happens is ina lot of websites they havethis program in whichif you identify any bugs,if you notice any abnormal activityon their website,you can report it to them,and if they find it to be true,if they see thatthat's actually the case,they will pay youfor notifying them.So this is called ethical hacking.You can learn abouthow this works on YouTube,and a variety of different coursesthat you buy and you can learnabout the same.But once you know how to properlylook at a website and find outsome bugs,you can then start pitching itto all of these companies.I had this one friend,and she had recognized bugsin Google, in Tiktok,and in Microsoft.They are very small bugs likea compatibility issue witha particular screen size,small things like that,and they will pay you handsomely,they will pay you $3,000-5,000for identifying just this one thing,because it might look small to you,but they are operating ona scale of billions of usersevery single day,all of these giant co-operations.So just this one small optimizationwill help them 10 folds whenthey are working on a larger scale.So that is a bug bounty program.There are a lot of websites.You can search for bug bountyprograms available right now,and you will find all the websitesthat support that.Most big companies have thisand so this can be a great wayfor you to make money on the side.I have a brother, he identifieda bug in Facebook, in Google,as well as in Apple, so a greatfield for you to explore.It's a lot of fun, like justtinkering around with the websitetrying to find something interesting.That's what you can also do.Basically, a lot of hackersmisuse this particular opportunity to,you know, maybe steal dataor something, and if you arebeing a good person identifyingabout them, they appreciate itand that's why you get paidfor that.So that's how that works.The ninth way to make moneywould be to get researchor summer internships.In my batch, there area lot of people who are goingto Carnegie Mellon fora research internship,someone is going to MIT,someone is going to Harvard.It is basically like a 3-6 monthlong internship,completely paid for them,and they also get a stipend.They go there, and they workon a project with a professor,and they try to createa report at the end.So that's basically how that works.You need to learn how to contactall of these professors out there.First of all, you willhave to read their research papers,whatever it is thatthey are releasing,if it is somethingthat is interestingin your own domain,read their research papers,reach out to them and say,'Sir, I had a look atwhat you are working on,and I think this is reallyinteresting. This is whatI have been working on forthe past 2-3 months,and I would love to work with youand learn more about thisparticular field.'I also reached out,and there was this one professorwho is working at Carnegie Mellonitself, and he said,'Sure, I would love to learnmore about it, we can connecton a call.'We connected on a calland I ended up saying that,'I wouldn't be coming to you for work.I was just interested to learnabout how things really were.'They are very much opento getting you in,and teaching you, and basically,it's just an apprenticeship,so you work with someonewho has been in thatparticular industry for tens of years,and they are able to help you learna thing or two about it,and you get to visit a new place,make some new friends,and that's always a win-win situation.So that's going to bea research internship.You can any day just doa summer internship.I have many friendswho would be going to Bangalorewhen the summer starts there now,and they would be doing internshipsin the big startups out there.So these can be internships ofmay be like a UI/UX designer,it could be a PM intern,it could also be a developer,a junior developer intern position,so that's basicallyhow things really work.For this, you can approachwebsites like AngelList,you can also go to theirparticular career space,and you can try to applyfor that.If you do it through referrals,then you have a better chanceto work with them.And just be honest,'This is what I have worked on,and this is why I love youridea particularlyand what you guys are working on,I would love to grow together.'Just be honest and approach themand they would be more thanwilling to work with you.Recently, I was talking toa web3 startup,I was just talking abouta collaboration that we can have,and they just said,'Hey, you know so muchabout this field,we would love to onboard youas an employee over here,and you can work as our DevRel,a developer advocate role.'And that was really interestingto me because I was just talkingto that guy for the last 1-2 hours,and that guy was really impressedby whatever it is that I am tryingto know or trying to buildin this space.So just be honest and justshare your opinionsand you will definitelyfind opportunities in Bangalore,or in the startup system in general.So that is the 9th way to make money.The last one is really interestingbecause this is whereyou prioritize yourself.You prioritize whateverit is that you know.You can do that with the helpof creating digital assets,digital products.Number one would beto create your own ebook.So this is a reallyinteresting thing,it's completely permissionless.The way this works is,whatever is it that you havelearned as a skill,or a particular experience,or maybe you lovea particular topic,maybe quantum mechanics,or whatever it is that you love,maybe you love writing storiesabout just anything in general,get a Google docand start writing about it.And what you realize is that,you can take this piece of documentand you can publish thiswith the help of Amazon KDP.KDP is basicallyKindle Direct Publishing.With the help of this,you can publish your bookscompletely free,and they will be availableon all major Amazon websitesaround the world.So you get that distributionof Amazon for completely zero charges,and they only take a commissionon whatever salesyou will be having for the book.Now this happened to me particularly,I wrote my own book abouthow can you utilize opportunitieson LinkedIn, calledCrush it on LinkedIn.And I've been makinga lot of videos about it as well,but there wasn't anythingconcrete that I had put out,like there were some videoswith some views,and then they go away,and people are just like,What do we do now?Because they are not ableto find the video.So I was just like,let me just make one proper ebook.So I wrote just likea 90-page ebook.I wrote it over a weekend or two,and I published it on 12th July,just one day before my birthdayin 2020.So that was a great experiencebecause I learnedhow to write a book,how to edit it,how to make its poster,the cover of it,and how to publish it.So you can do the same,and once you are done with that,people will buy it.You will also have to optimize itfor the Amazon search feed.You have to include a few terms in it,you can learn about that,just Google it.I have learned everything from Google.I haven't sought some mentorto teach me or something like that.It's because I watchamazing videos of peoplelike Ankur right here,and a bunch of other insightful creators,and then I have just Googled everything,that's how I have learnedeverything so far.So just be curious,and you can create an ebook.You can also make a courseon whatever it is that you are doing.There are a lot of platformsthrough which you can publishit for free, and they will justtake a 10-20% cut forthe platform charges.And once you create them,you can sell them multiple times.There is a very good quote,Build once, sell twice.And that basically means,how can you create productsthat have everything that youparticularly know,or what you are known for basically,and people can buy it multiple timeswithout additional cost of replication.So that's what I feel about it.There are various different thingsthat you can do.You can build your digital assets,and that will be a sourceof passive income for you.So that's how it works.You also, of course, need to havebut distribution in order to sellall of these things,but we can talk aboutthat in the later video,how to become a creator and all?So these were the 10 waysin which you can make moneyas a college student.I have tried most of them or not,my college students and the peoplethat I work with have definitelytried all of them.They work really welland you can easily make30-50 thousand or even more than thatevery single month as a studentdoing this part-timewhile also focusing on yourcollege and your studies.Fantastic, man!I loved it!There is so much to know,and Ishan, you are rightthat we
