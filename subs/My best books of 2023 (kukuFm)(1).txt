written many such books,but this was the one that struckthe most with me about influence.And this book is remarkable becauseit shares actual psychological hacks.How can you exercise influenceon another person?There are a lot of beautifulreal-life examples where you can influenceyour managers, your colleagues,your family, your friends,and how all of this works.A very interesting bookand I really liked this read.So this is one of the books frommy top 10 books of 2022.Number 2: Stillness Is the Keyby Ryan Holiday.Ryan holiday runsa very famous Instagram channelcalled The Daily Stoic.And this book by him,Stillness Is the Keyis a brilliant introductionto the philosophy of stoicism.Stoicism is a Greek philosophy,and it conveys a lot of thingsthat are important to living life.If you do not know about stoicism,then I would urge you to read about it,but this book is its best introduction.It basically says thathaving stillness,where you don't get too excited in life,you don't get too stressed in life,you are calm in a way,the 'Dhoni mode' as you call it,that is the key to living life.Because the more anxious you are,the happier you always be,you will actually fluctuatebetween these extreme emotions,and you will never actually feel life.So this brilliant book,a very simple bookbut very very powerful book,highly recommended!So this is the second bookfrom my top 10 books of 2022.Number 3: Bitcoin Billionairesby Ben Mezrich,I don't know how to pronounce that.It is a fascinating tale,not just about Bitcoin,because you probably know about Bitcoin,or you may not be interested in it,then you definitely must read this book,because it is not telling youabout investing or crypto,it is about the story of two brothers,identical twins calledthe Winklevoss brothers.If you have watched the movieSocial Network,the movie about starting of Facebook,Mark Zuckerberg fights a court caseagainst the Winklevoss brothersin that movie,because they claim that Mark Zuckerbergstole their idea and started Facebook.Long story short, that chapter ends.And then in 2011-12,the Winklevoss brothers discovereda new concept called Bitcoin,and they start investing their moneyin Bitcoin,and how they become one of thebiggest investors and owners of Bitcoin.It is a very interesting book!If you are fond of business stories,then this is a highly recommended book.The 3rd

this year,and I have already read this book thricein this year.3 times!The whole book!And I learned something new every time!It's very difficult to describe this book.There is a person called Kapil Guptawho shares amazing content on Twitter,he has written this book,and this is basicallythe most hard-hitting book about life.Probably this book is the best bookto understand life,but I think this book is not meantfor all age groups.Since I am in my 40s, maybe this bookis more applicable to me,because I have lived life,and experienced a lot,that's why I understandwhat this book is trying to say.But if you read this book in your 20s,you will say, it is a rubbish book,he doesn't understand anything,he has lost his mind,now he's messing with me,and that could be your reaction,but give it a shot!Who knows!?So this book is at fourth numberin my top 20 books of 2020.It is not the rank, but the fourth book.Next is Will Smith's autobiographyor actually biography becauseit is not written by Will Smith.I don't think you would know but...This book is written by Mark Manson.This book is the story of Will Smithbut it is written by Mark Manson,Mark Manson is the same personwho wrote the bestsellerThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F***,which is also a great read,but I read it before 2022.It is a great story because,if you do not know Will Smith,I grew up at a time when Will Smithwas the shit,he was the man who was doing everything,and he was the best, most successfulmovie star of his time.And how he left collegeand wanted to become a rapper,then he left rapand became a television artist,and then proceeded to becomea Hollywood star,and then he just went on.It is a great great story.Of course, this book was releasedduring the Oscars when Will Smithcreated that incident,and that of course made this bookmaybe go even more popular, who knows!?But a very good book,a very inspiring book,and something that everyone should read.So this is the fifth bookin my top 10 books of 2022.Next is American Kingpin:Catching the Billion-Dollar Baronof the Dark Web.A book by Nick Bilton.I don't think any of you would know this,but in 2012-13, a website was startedcalled Silk route.Basically, Silk route was the first andcertainly the largest e-commerce companybased on bitcoin.So all the transactions there were donewith Bitcoin, not with money,actually not with dollars.And because of that,since Bitcoin is anonymous,Bitcoin is private,and it has no central authority,in that sense,it became the e-commerce websitefor literally anything.So it started with drugs,a lot of drugs were available,it went into arms and ammunitions,then people started doingsome other things,and that's why the owner of Silk routewas caught, and he is currently in prison.So this whole story is abouthow they actually went into catchingthis 26-year-old programmer.His name was Ross Ulbricht.And it's a brilliant fascinating book.I don't think I have reada more fast-paced book this year.It was such a brilliant read!These 10 books can be yours!Again, you have to subscribe,and comment that which bookwould you like to reador which is your favorite,and then wait for 3 weeks,I will announce the

is a very interesting powerful bookwhich says that often we remembersome moments more in our life.Somewhere there was an event,somewhere there was a concert,somewhere we met someone,and something about that makes usremember that moment.So this book breaks that moment downto see what was it in that momentthat we remember,and forget the rest of the moments,and how can you recreate those momentsin your life as well.Whether you are a working professional,a manager, an owner, or a student,how can you create these momentsin your everyday life,so that people remember youand that moment?Brilliant book, highly recommended!Number 8: Cold Steel.I don't know how many of you knowLakshmi Mittalwho is one of the richest peoplein the world,and he owns Mittal Steeland now ArcelorMittal.And this is a story about how Arcelorand Mittal Steel merged together.And it was not a merger,Mittal Steel bought ArcelorMittal.And that is how one ofthe biggest steel companies in the worldwas formed,and this story is that entire journey.How did the bid?How did all the negotiationsand discussions happen?And ultimately Mittal Steel won,and merged Arcelor with its own companyto

book is by Anna Wiener.If you are a woman in tech,then you would relate to this booklike nothing else.This book is basically by Anna,who has worked as a woman in tech,as a product manager, as a designer,in a lot of tech companies,and her experiences of dealingwith everything.Sexism, racism,just the general riff-raff.How do these companies struggle?How do they make sense?How she could not make sensein this entire world?Brilliant yearbook,one of my friends had recommended methis book,and when she recommended it,I realized why she felt so passionatelyabout this book,because after reading this book,even I could relate to so many things,despite not being a woman,but understanding what is itthat they go through.One of my best reads for this year!Thoroughly enjoyable!You would also love it!And finally, Empire of Pain.This is the biggest bookthat I read this year.It took me at least 2-3 weeksto read this whole book.It is a thick book,but an insanely good book!Sackler family which wasa famous and rich family in the US,how they were the ones who gotthe US addicted to drugs.They were a pharma companythat manufactured pain-relieving drugs,but they knew thatthose pain-relieving drugswould be addictive at some point,and despite knowing that,they kept selling and marketing that drug,and since they wanted to give a good colorto that money,how they started putting that moneyinto
