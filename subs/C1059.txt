When the markets start going down,how should your investmentstrategy change?We will get to know in this video.Friends, the beginning of 2022hasn't been good.After a bull run of 2 yearsin the stock market,the devastation in the marketafter covid, people thoughteverything is done and dusted,but after that,the way market has risenfor 2 years,no one could have predicted that.But towards the end of 2021and the first part of 2022has been fairly choppy.The market has gone downby 20-25-30%.And for the first time,I can see so many of my stocksas 80% negative, 40% negative,and it is not somethingthat I think most of you would have seenin your investing journey.In this video, I want to sharethe tip and tricks with youwhich are used by seasoned,smart, wise investors to navigatethrough bear markets.It's not just applicablefor what we are going throughright now, but for any marketwhere more than 20% correctionhas happened, which meansthe market has gone down bymore than 20%.First of all, the definitionof recession.As I said, whenever any marketgoes down by 20% or goes througha correction of 20%,then it seems like a correction.That is not a recession.A recession means thatthe economy of a countryor the world is growingnegatively,which means it is de-growingfor two consecutive quarters.In the last quarter,the US economy actuallydegrew by around 1.3%,if I am not wrong.If another quarter comes ofdegrowth or negative growth,then formally, officially,the US is in recession.And if that happens,then it may mean somevery bad news for a prolongedperiod of time.India is still safe.We are one of the fastest-growingcountries in the world.A lot is happening here,but in our market as wellthere is a major correction,and largely because of 3 thingsthat are happening globally.The Ukraine-Russia warclearly created an energy crisisacross the world, and then,of course, there ispolitical instability.Supply chain issues of Chinabecause of its covid issues.A lot of technology companiesaren't able to get chips.And thirdly, because of covid,the US government printeda large number of dollars,so there is massive liquidityin the market that is flowing inbut it does not know whereto flow it.Because of these three issues,we are caught in a veryinteresting economic situationcalled stagflation.And it is important to know,before I share thosetips and tricks,try to understand thiswith absolute focus.You want to be smartabout this, wouldn't you?What is stagflation?Stagflation is a periodwhen there is no growthand very high inflation.This means the economyis not growing,income is not growing,but the prices of thingsare growing rapidly,and that is the periodthat we seem to be going in,particularly for the US.And if the US goes intostagflation, then it becomesa really hard situationbecause as surprising as it sounds,economists do not have any wayof clearly handling stagflation,so what they tend to do isincrease the interest rateson which banks give usor other banks loans,so that we spend less of our moneyand save it more,because we get morerate of interest,but that is the only waythat they mostly use forcontaining inflation,and hoping it fixes.It may fix, may not fix!Long story short,it is possible thatin the next 1-2 years,markets go througha choppy period,and you need to be preparedfor that.How?Number 1: Save money.Please save as much money as you can.As it is inflationis going high,which means things arebecoming expensive rapidly,so whatever is it that youare spending money onthat is not needed,you are ending up spendinga lot more money,and the money you have savedfor investing, for your future,is getting lesser and lesser.So please, over the next1-2 years, your income may notincrease that rapidly,but your savings and thusyour investments mustincrease rapidly.So do not spend lavishlyon things that you do notneed immediately.Number 2: Invest regularly.We cannot time the market.A lot of people think,'Market will go down even more.'But just when it startsgoing up, they say,'Wait! It will go down!'You don't want to be doing that.You are not experts,I am at least not an expert,so I don't try to time the market.I am very clinical aboutall my investments,and the only thing that I do is,if I have any excess cash,then I will deploy it evenmore during these periodsof a bear market,because I know I am gettinga lot of high-quality investmentsat a very cheap price.Whether they are stocks,whether it's even debt,whether it's anything elseand we will talk about it,but the best thing that you can dois regularly invest.Number 3: If you haveany lump-sum amount,whether you got a bonus,or you broke your FD,it's good that you broke it,but why did you have an FD?It's ok,everybody makes mistakes.Small mistakes keep happeningin big countries.This felt flat, never mind.Use it if you want, Aditya.So if you have a lump sum amount,then you can convert it into a SIP.Don't put all of that money in,because you don't knowhow much the market willdip or rise.So my suggestion isto convert 60% of yourlump sum amount into 6 equal SIPs.Keep the remaining 40%with yourself.If there comes a time,when you feel that the markethas tanked as much as it could,then you can invest that40% in one go as well,but convert your lump sumamount also into SIPs.Number 4: Invest safely.Don't invest in equities only.You can take risks,but this is also a timeto diversify.Try to explore otherasset classes as well.For example, there's debtor fixed income, there arecommodities like gold,and there are equities.A great way of doing that,I invest in a smallcase calledAll Weather Investing.In my opinion, that is one ofthe best starter investmentsto make for anybody starting,particularly at the timeof down-market.Because what it has isa beautiful balance betweenthese three things.If you see here,gold is around 40%,equity is around 36%,and debt is around 26%.So it has a balanced approachand that's why you getstable returns.So its 4-year CAGR is 10.75,which is pretty good,so you will get 11% in 4 years.You don't have to investin this for the rest of your life,because 11% may not be enough,but in this period,when you don't knowHow much down willthe equities go?What will happen to them?How much volatility is there?You are far better off investingin something which isa combination of fixed income,of commodities that areslightly less volatilethan equities,where even if there's volatility,then you will be able to waitthrough because 60% allocationis somewhere else.This is a quarterly rebalance,which means this compositionis not static, it keeps changing.Every three months,you have to refreshthe combination.The best part about this isthat it is absolutely free.This smallcase ofAll Weather Investingis a free smallcase.The only charges that you haveto pay will be the brokeragecharges that you haveto pay at end of your broker,whoever is it.So, please invest safelyand diversify your risk.Number 5: Focus on the long term.This is not the periodto make money overnight.In fact, no period should befor making money overnight,but particularly this periodcan be very damaging,because it is going to bevery very seductive.Many people will tell youthat now is the timeto make money,because you can do swing trading,as the market moves horizontallyand there's fluctuation,so you can do intraday trading,you can invest inFutures and Options,please do all of thatif you are an expert.But if you are not,if you don't understand that,if you do not know how to do it,then don't.Just focus on long-term investing.Just focus on how much returncan you generate in 5-10 years.Because this market is goingto give you the opportunityto create brilliant outcomesover the next 5-10 years,because the market is goingthrough correction,which means all the valuableexpensive stocks arenow reasonable,and their growth is still going on.So you don't want to miss outon the future opportunityof all of these great companies,whether it is standardFMCG companies in India,standard technology orIT companies in India,standard manufacturing companiesin India, all the fundamentalswill not fade away overnight.The market is going througha correction only becauseof external conditions,so that means all of thesevaluable stocks overa long period of timeare going to give youbrilliant returns if you havea long-term approach.Number 6: If you alreadyhave some investments,they would of course bein negative.Please don't do panic selling.That is a rookie mistake to make.The only reason why youshould be selling your stocksright now is for tax harvestingpurposes.I created a video on tax harvestingwhich you can check outand see how does it work,but that should, in my opinion,be the only reason that you shouldsell your stocks right now.If you sell your stocks right now,it would mean,you did not ever believein how the stock market works.Because by definition,the stock market my friend,fluctuates all the time.So if you have been witnessinga rise for the last two years,and you were very happybecause of that,be prepared for 2 yearsof downfall, and then it willrise back again.But when it does, it will beat a level higherthan where it was before.Historically, this is how ithas always been.So you have no reasonto believe thatthat will not be replicated.I know that for a lot ofpeople watching this video,this is the first timethat you are seeing suchnegative returns foryour investments.But I have witnessedthat several timesin my lifetime.In the years 2000, 2007-2008,2015, 2019, and 2020,all of these correctionsare something that you knoware inevitable, but oncethe market comes back,it rises far above,and that is what you haveto wait out for.Number 7: Don't investbecause of FOMO.Please, a lot of peoplewill take advantage of thisopportunity to give you falseor seductive information.'Hey, Bitcoin and cryptohave become so cheap,invest money in it!'Invest, but only investas much as you alwaysused to invest.Don't invest in FOMObecause you think you'llmake it big,and get rich overnight,that doesn't happen.Don't make those mistakes.Don't invest in penny stocks.If any stock givesthe information that youinvest in it,you will get 40% in 3 days!Don't do it!Even if that happens,don't do it, because what youare doing is investing in FOMO,and you don't want to bedoing that.Wise investors do notinvest in FOMO!And finally, if you areinvesting in equities,then instead of stock picking,right now do index-investing.Index-investing means youinvest in a portfolio.It could be a smallcase,as I said, All Weather Investingis a great smallcase because that isa portfolio of investmentsthat you are putting in,where there is an investmentin gold, debt, and equity,in both large-cap and mid-cap.So your risk is wonderfullymitigated.And similarly, you can alsoinvest in an index orportfolio of stocksas against picking upone stock itself.In Smallcase, you will finda lot of smallcases wherethere will be a portfolioof stocks, where you canpick up ideas that youwant to represent.If you want to bet onthe middle class of India,then you can pick the stocksof the companies that arebuilding products forthe middle class of India.Companies that are buildingfor rural India.Companies that are onlyfrom the House of Tata.Companies that are onlyand only focused on ITor Pharma, whatever it is,you essentially are sayingthat I don't havethe capability to pickeach stock, so what I'mgoing to do is pick upa portfolio of stocks,so that if one goes upand another goes down,at the end I am stillaveraged out.These are the approachesthat I have personallyfollowed every single timewhen I have gone througha down market, or a correction,and I am sharing thisexperience with you,so that you can benefitfrom that experienceas much as I have.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
