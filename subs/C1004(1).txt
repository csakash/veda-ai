Check 1 2 ok let's get startedIf you want to investin real estate but you don't havecrores to invest,then how can you start yourreal estate investing journeyin â¹ 400 only?Let's get to know in this video.Friends, every Indian middle-classfamily has a dream to havea roof on their head.To own real estate, to owna house is every middle-classfamily's heartfelt desire.And because of that real estateas an investment asset is famousin this country for years.There are so many businessesthat have invested and earnedcrores of money through real estate,because in the last 40-50 years,real estate, especially inthe top cities of this country,has just gone through the roof.Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore,Hyderabad, Chennai,if you look at the main marketsof these top cities,people who bought real estatein the 70s and 80s,whether it was house or office,now they are sittingon land worth crores,and earning brilliant rental income.So the good thing about real estateis that not only does it give youa steady rental incomebecause you can give it on rentand make an income come out of it,but it also gives youcapital appreciation,which means that the ratesof the land of that real estatewould keep increasing asthe scarcity of lands keepsincreasing, and that will alsogive you a return at the end of it.That is why a lot of peoplewho have bought their housesworth lakhs are now worth crores,and they are actuallymulti-billionaires with justreal estate as their assets.Fun fact: My driver isfrom Faridabad, and I believethough I cannot prove it,because of the agricultural landthat my driver has,his net worth is much morethan mine, despite the factthat I am investing in equity,US market, crypto,here and there,but his net worth would bemore than my net worthbecause he is sitting on mega acresof agricultural land,which I never had.So investing in real estateis something that a lot ofpeople want to do.But the big limitation isthe ticket size.You need lakhs and croresof rupees to invest in real estate,and that becomes a really big item,especially for early investorsto let go of.I would never advise takinga loan and investing in real estatebecause that is somethingthat almost never works.The amount of your rental incomeand return, broadlytheir combination would beused in your loan interest only,not something that I would recommend.I made a full video onWhat are the returnsfrom real estate investing?Two things were very clear in it.One: Commercial real estateis far better thanresidential real estate.Why?Because its rental yield is more.What is rental yield?How much percentage isthe annual rental incomeof the value of your property.Let's say the value of yourproperty is â¹1 crore,it could be a shopor office or anything,and your annual rental incomeis â¹2 lakhs, which is aroundâ¹18K-20K per month.So your rental yield is 2% whichis â¹2 lakhs divided by â¹1 crore.The rental yield ofcommercial real estateis anywhere between 5-7%,and the rental yield ofresidential real estate is 1-2%for a maximum of 3%,which is why commercial real estateis a far better investment to make.Number 2: Whenever you wantto make an investment,then to increase this rental yield,you need to be in prime property,and you need to ensure thatthe office you have boughtis properly maintained,you are getting good tenants,they pay you on time,you are able to collect it properly,all of that is a lot of work.So to invest in real estate,you not only need capitalbut also time and brain spaceto take care of all this caboodle,and that is not somethingthat everybody has.That is why a great alternativeto real estate investmentis called REIT.Real Estate Investment Trust,and in this video,I will introduce you to REITs,a very new but a very good optionthat has started evolvingin India, and I am convincedthat over the next several yearsand decades, REITs will becomea phenomenal way forany retail investor to investin the real estate marketwithout buying the actual property.How does REIT work?How do mutual funds work?You say you want to buya Nifty 50 mutual fund,which means you want to buythe top 50 stocks ofthe National Stock Exchange.How many should you buy?Do those 50 stocks remainthe same?No, they also keep changing.So, that needs tracking.Now if I have to buy allthe stocks one by one,that will take a lot of money?I don't have that kind of money,I only have around â¹500-1000every month to do SIP,then how should I go about it?All of these are managed bya mutual fund.So what does a mutual fund say?Mutual fund says we will investin these top 50 stocks,but we will bring in thousandsand lakhs of investorswho will give smallamounts of money,which will give usa corpus of crores,and that corpus of croreswill be managed by a fund manager,and that person will doall the research for you.They will figure out,which are the 50 stocks?They will figure out,when to buy?They will figure out,how many to by?They will figure out,the balances that need to be done,like increasing its weightageor decreasing a certainstock's weightage, etc.?And for all this, they chargea small percentage from us.That is the concept ofa mutual fund.In the exact same way,a REIT also works.Assume that REIT is a developer,or a company, or a trust manager,and they say that we want tobuy this commercial building,and after buying thiscommercial building,the rental incomeand the capital appreciationof this commercial building,we will give all that to youbut we will manage it for you,we take responsibilityfor everything.Is the rental comingon time or not?Collecting the rental?All the paperwork, legal work,filing all the taxes?We will take all theseresponsibilities.All you have to do isinvest your money,and the best thing is that,they allow forfractional ownership.Technically, you would bebuying a very small partof a huge building,depending on the amountyou would have invested in it.This is the simple concept of REIT.The best thing about REIT...So what are the benefits of REIT?Number 1: You get ownershipof real estate ina very small amount,both the benefits of real estate,not just rental income butcapital appreciation as well.So the company or the trustwhich is managing this REIT,they will take the rental income,they will bookthe capital appreciation,and you will getthe benefits of itin the form of dividendsfrom the rental income,in the form of the priceof the unit which will keepincreasing,so as capital appreciation happens,the price of the unit willalso increase,the same way that the NAVor Net Asset Value ofa mutual fund goes up,just as the stocks keepperforming well.So that's benefit number 1.Benefit number 2: You candiversify in different locations.You can say,I want to invest inthe real estate in Bangaloreor Bombay or Delhi orin tier-2 cities,all of those optionsare technically available.They are not availableright now in India,but gradually as REITsbecome more and more common,you will start gettingall these options,because it allowsfor different truststo have differentinvestment approaches,with which you agree or not,and then invest accordingly.Number 3: As I said,there is no hassle,no administrative hassle.You don't have to lookfor tenants,you don't have to doany paperwork,you don't have to talkto the lawyers,you don't have to give theproperty taxor get the registry done,all of that is taken careby the trust and thatis the best part.Number 4: Actually that was notthe best part, this is.How many best parts do I tell?!The best part,and I can genuinely vouch for it,is the liquidity.These REIT units,they are traded inthe market of the stock exchange.This means, if youever need money at any point in time,then as you can simplysell your stocks and getyour money instantly,T+1,get your money in yourbank account in a day or two,in the same way,you can sell the units of REIT,and get your money back ina day or two.So it's not like,you need moneyand you have to sell your house,so now you have to lookfor a buyer,and do all the negotiations,you don't have to get intothe headache, it is a freelytraded commodity on the exchange,and that is why the liquidityin a real estate industryis unparalleled.Now is REIT trustworthy or not?This is something thata lot of people ask.So Number 1, it's importantto know, that REITs are regulated.They are not free for all.So Ankur warikoo cannot opena REIT and put it on the exchange.There are SEBI registeredand SEBI regulated,so all the REITs areadministered by SEBI,just the same way,when any company is listedon the exchange,it goes through SEBI.Second, it's great, thatat least 80% of the amountor the corpus collected by REIT,that has to be deployedin commercial real estate.So not on residentialbut in commercial real estate,which if you rememberhas a higher rental yield,and that's why you will getmore rental income,and your investment in REITwill keep increasing becauseyou will get morebang for your buck.And number 3, there arere-distribution or distribution laws.SEBI, you mandatorilyor compulsorily have todistribute the rental incomethrough dividend, you cannotkeep all of it for doingwhat you want to do.So I think 90% ofthe rental incomeis distributed as dividend income,so you will keep gettinga regular income.It's not a lot, 5-6% ofyour total value,but whatever it is,it's good that it's coming,plus capital appreciationis already happening,because as the value ofthe land keeps increasing,the value of your unit alsokeeps increasing.So let's look at one REITand try to understand it.I am on Zerodha right now,on Kite, and I have chosenthe REIT of Embassy Office Parks.Embassy is a huge, largelyin the south, but graduallyit is making a national footprint,they are developers.You must have heard of WeWork,so WeWork and Embassy havea tie-up, so whereveryou will see WeWork,most of them are inthe Embassy building,which is always a great sign.So this is one REIT.I want to see its detailed infoso I will go here, Tickertape ,I don't know if you use itor not, but it is a greatresearch platform.So let's see the returns.The first thing you will seeis that it is like a stock price.So in one day, like I can seetoday's movement, 390 washigh and 382 was low,so it stayed between 382-390,this is like a properstock movement, so you canbuy or sell it as many timesyou wanted.Let's look at the one-year return.One year return is 21%,not bad at all,in fact very very good,it is not sustainableso it dips over a period of time.Let's look at 5-year, wow, 22%!This means you got a returnof 22% on an average over 5 years.Quite brilliant froma return perspective!If you look at the max,from the time when it started,it is 22.39%, which is good.If we see the financials,we can see how the financialshave moved.What is the total revenue?It is around, I think it'sin crores, â¹3185 crores.EBITDA is â¹2500 crores,so quite impressive.EPS or Earnings Per Shareis around â¹9, so on and so forth.The payout ratio is broadly 2.64%.The dividend per share is â¹21,so if you had one share,then you got â¹21 in a year,which is the dividendthat you got by the virtueof the rental incomethat they did.If you look at the Holdings,the promoters hold 61%,and there is mutual fund,and foreign institutions,so this gives you a sense ofhow good is its spread ofHoldings and so on.And this is how you wouldevaluate whatever is the REIT.If you want to buy it,you can see it is â¹383.The market is closed right now,so I can place an AMOor After Market Order.If I do that, this isa validity, limit is accordingto the market.'Buy'No market order so youwill have to go back.If you want to buy thenit is a normal buying processas you buy on Zerodha.1 unit is for around â¹385,this was the last ending,so technically,as I said at the beginningof the video,start your real estate investmentjourney under â¹400.As Embassy keeps increasing,your investment will alsokeep increasing.What are the othersthat you can evaluate?I think there are two more.The other one is Mindspace.If you go to Mindspace RR,you will see Mindspace business parks.If you see the detailedinfo on Tickertape.One-year return is around 17%,not bad.5-year return is around 15%,again not bad.Usually, Embassy is the best.There aren't too many optionsfor REITs.I think there are just three,Embassy, Mindspace, and Brookfield.But if you want to invest,then my suggestion will be,to do a SIP in all threeof the smallest amount possible,because then you will geta good nice happy exposureto real estate,sometimes one is upand the other is down,but your spreads of returnwill be evened out.This is how you can startyour real estate journeywith the smallest amount possible,and still ride onthe real estate footprintthat our best developers have.I believe that in the next5-10 years, real estate in India,specifically commercialreal estate in India, will boom,because there are a lot ofinfrastructures that aregetting planned, there isa lot of industry pushthat is happening,there is a lot of 'make in India'push that is happening,so commercial real estateis almost always the beneficiaryof every economic growthwhich is witnessedby any country,and that is why,at least I remain bullish,if I have to choosean investment option lesserthan equity but safer,then REITs is a greatalternative.I don't think REITscan replace equities,I believe that equity growthwill always be more,but if you are happywith this lower risk lower return,then I think REITs could bea terrific way for you tobite into the real estateasset class and start yourreal estate investing journey.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
