Can you become a millionairewith a salary of justâ¹50,000 per month?Yes!How?We'll get to know in this video.Friends, when KBC becamea reality in our world,since then there isa different feel aboutbecoming a millionaire.Of course, there used to bemillionaires earlier alsobut at that time we used to thinkthat we can never be millionaires.We may have lakhs of rupees,but becoming a millionairefelt like a distant dream!Becoming a millionairefelt like a distant dream!Today in this video,I want to show youhow with minimal riskand a lot of confidencein how markets behave...It's raining cats and dogs in Delhi!I could feel the thunder!Anyway, sorry!Without taking a lot of risks,but being very plannedand very disciplinedabout the approach,how can you actuallybecome a millionaire?And everything will be donethrough an excel sheet!Let's get started!Before I begin, it's important to tell youthat the basis of this approach isa very honest basis.This means, you will haveto be honest yourself.You cannot become a millionaireby tempting or luring yourself,because it is very easy to becomea millionaire on an excel sheet.Only a number has to be entered!But to become a millionairein real life,you need that disciplineand that regularitywhich starts with the right assumptionsto be in the first place.All these green cellsare those amounts whereI am asking you a question,and you then have to answer honestly.To use this Excel sheet for yourself,you can click on the linkin the pinned commentor the description.A link in the Google sheetor Google Drive will open,you will have to downloadthis Excel sheet from there,and once you have downloaded it,you can play around with thatas much as you want.Ok, let's get started.My first assumption isthat your in-hand salary post-taxis â¹50,000,because that's what I am starting with,it could be whatever it is.So you can enter your amount herefor you to figure thatat what age would you havecrores of rupees for whichyou are working.And I am also assuming that every yearyour average increment would bearound 8%.Now for you, it could be 10%,it could be 6%, you have to enterthe real number here.These are my assumptionsthat I am starting with.After this, let's startwith the actual details.First of all, you will haveto tell me what are yourcurrent monthly needs.Your needs, without whichyou cannot be alive,you cannot run your house,you cannot live properly,is what you need to document.For example, rent.I have assumed it to beâ¹8,000 per month.And I am also assuming thatthis will keep growingby 10% every year.So it will actually keep growingtill forever by 10% every year,which is broadly the rental increase.I am also asking for essential EMIs.What are essential EMIs?EMI for your house, some EMIwhich is actually for your need.This is not the EMI for your wants!Like EMI for your phone.EMI for your second expensive car.Not at all!This is for the loan for your needs,like education loan, home loan,whatever, those are there.I have assumed them to be zerobecause the salary is â¹50000,so ideally there should not beany loan.How much do you spendon food every month?How much do you spend on utilitieslike water and electricity?What about bills like phone bills, etc.?If there is any fee to be paid,you are studying, or your kidsare studying, whatever?Towards family: You give some moneyto your parents or to the household?And whatever else you want to put in.So you can choose your items.And this is the most important,that you will have to givean estimate that withhow much percentage will itkeep increasing in your lifeevery year.I have taken it as 5% everywhereexcept for rent,because I have assumed thatit will keep increasing atthe rate of inflation.You have to decide what you want.If you think it will increasemore quickly, do that.If you think it won't,don't do that.Then we come to current monthly wants.These are your desires.These are thingsthat you can live without,but I don't want that to becomea millionaire you shouldgive up everythingin your life and be like,'I won't party! I won't buy anything,no clothes, whatever!'No, nothing like that!Live life the way it isbut with budgeting.You must have heard ofthe 50:30:20 rule.We will come back to that,but this is what will account for it.So for clothes, I have assumed â¹500.Eating out and ordering inis very prevalent these days,so I have assumed itas â¹1,500 per month.Discretionary EMIs,like you got a phoneor something else,so â¹1,500 for that.For vacation, you won't gofor vacation every month,but whatever it is thatyou are saving, so let's say,you are planning fora six-month vacation,so you are savingâ¹2,500 every month for that.So that after 6 months,â¹15-18K that you saved,you will use it for a vacation,and so on.And you are also applying,again growth rates.It's simple logic!It becomes detailedwhen you begin to answer questionsfor yourself.So the total amount spentis â¹23,000 per month fromthe â¹50,000 that you get in hand.This means that you can investthe remaining â¹27,000.Step number 1:Now, this is an important stepto consider.There are two perspectiveson investment.Perspective number 1:Whatever money is leftafter my expenses,I will invest it.Perspective number 2:First I will take outthe investment frommy monthly income,I will take out money for myself,and then whatever will be left,I will run my householdfor the month with that.Have you heard of the book,Rich Dad Poor Dad?You must have!You may not have read it,but must have heard of it.This was the most important thingthat was established in it.That every person gives moneyto the governmentin the form of taxes,to the banks in the form of loans,to somebody else in some other form,and whatever is left after that,that is what they spend on themselves.Wrong way of doing it!The ones who truly get wealthy,are the ones who pay themselves firstand then pay the others.Yes, there are some needswhich you will have to pay for,like EMI, etc.But if you are someone who saysthat as soon as â¹50,000 hitmy bank account every month,I will transfer these â¹27,000to some other bank account.And I will use the remainingâ¹23,000 for my monthly expense,come what may!Then you are taking the first steptowards becoming a millionaire.Now you have to invest â¹27,000and you first have to declare,how old are you?Wow! What lightning!How old are you?I have assumed thatyou are 25 years old.Now, why is this important?It is important becauseas I told you atthe beginning of the video,we will not take a lot of risksto become a millionaire.We will try to grow and investthis money in a very planned manner.And the approach thatwe will follow is somethingcalled the 100 minus X approach.This means, if your age is X,which in this case is 25,then we will invest the X%in a stable income, so that it stays.So the stable incomethat I would suggest isthat you should investin PPF every month.Yes, there is a lock-in of15 years but we geta guaranteed returnwhich is tax-free.And it is a really good policyif you are investing forthe long term,and you don't want to takeany unnecessary riskin the short term.Now, the remaining 100 minus X,we will invest in equityor the stock market,because that's where we willget growth,but there would bevolatility as well,but it doesn't matter to us, right!Because we are investingfor the long term,and we are going towardsthe single aim of becominga millionaire.So every month,25% of the investment amount,which is â¹27,000,will go towards a fixed income,I have chosen PPF,you can choose any fixed income.According to me,PPF would be better,not a recommendation,but something thatI would do myself.And the remaining,75% in this case,will be invested in equities.When you will be 26 years oldin the next year,then 26% will be invested in PPF,and only 74% in equities.When you will be 30 years old,then 30% in PPF, 70% in equities,so on and so forth.I have done allthe calculations automatically.Returns: I have assumed thatthe returns on PPF overa long period would be 8%,and it would be tax-free.And the return on equityover a long period would be 15%,but a long-term capital gain taxwould be levied on it.After calculating all thisand assuming the inflation to be 5%,you will get to a number,which says thatat what age how much moneywould you have in the bank?And most importantly,it is easy to becomea millionaire in the future,because the money keeps growing,but there is inflation as well.But to become a millionaireaccording to today's money's valueis very difficult.So if you want â¹1 crore,you should have that â¹1 croreas of today's date, not like,'After 15 years,I would have â¹1 crore!'Because after 15 years,the value of that â¹1 crorewould be very less becauseof inflation.So it is important that youlook at row number 39,which is equal to whateveramount in today's price,and not what is in the bank.So let's do the math.We started with â¹50,000.We assumed the annual incrementas 8%.These are our monthly expenses.And we are investing â¹27,000every month, in the ratio of25:75, or X:100-X.And at the age of 37,you will have â¹1,40,00,000in your bank,which in today's money termswill be equal to â¹1,02,00,000.This is when you, my friend,will become a millionaire!And now you can easilyplay around with this thing.So you can say, my incomeright now is â¹75,000,and my expenses arebroadly the same.So if I look at the age of 30,I will have â¹50 lakhsat that point in time.But if I look at the age of 35,I would have â¹1,40,00000.Within 5 years, my â¹50,00,000would have grown to â¹1,40,00,000.If you want to know everythingexactly then,I think it will be around 32,33!At the age of 33, I will haveâ¹97 lakhs as per today's money,or â¹1,20,00,000 as perin the bank at that point in time.This is how it will work.You can easily look at allthe calculations here,that every year...Let me just blow it up.You can easily look atthe calculations, that every year,how much do you get in handat the age of 25?How much goes towardsneeds and wants?How much are your investments?How much is your PPF investment,and equity investment from it?And at what age,whatever the age you decide,how much money would you have saved?Which is how this entire sheet works.It is a very very simple approachtowards finding thatin how much time can you have â¹1 crore?Why did I make this video?I made this video becausea lot of people think thata small salary can never growto become a big amount.And I am here to tell youthat it is possible.Even if you start with â¹25,000.And let's say, your needswould be quite less, of course.Your rent would be â¹5,000.You are spending â¹1,500 on food.Utilities for â¹500.Bills remain the same.â¹3,000 for the household.Clothes can remain at â¹500.Eating out is only â¹1,000.You are smart, so yourdiscretionary EMI is zero.For vacations, let's make it â¹1,500.So you are able to investâ¹11,500 only every month,which is fine because the salaryis â¹25,000 only,so what more can you do!And if you go throughthis entire thing...And then if you go throughall of this, at the age of 43,you will have â¹1,65,00,000in your bank account,and it will be an amount equalto â¹1,03,00,000 as of today's price,starting with the salary of only â¹25,000.If you want to get a sense, that at 43...Let's do that.Salary at that age.So if youlook at 43...And if you think,'I would be earning in lakhsby the age of 43!This is a very childish calculation!'Then let's look at that number.At the age of 43,you would be earning â¹12 lakhs.That's it!So as of today, which is at 25 years,you started with a job that paysyou â¹3 lakhs annually.And I am saying that at the age of 43,you would be earning â¹12 lakhs,which is by the way,very very very likely.Today you might be thinkingthat it is impossible,but I can give it to you in writingthat if you have a salary of â¹3 lakhsat the age of 25, then at the age of 43,you will definitely have a salarymore than â¹12 lakhs,and despite all of that,you are still getting to becomea millionaire.That is what I wantto impress upon you.Becoming a millionaireis not all about luck,becoming a millionaireis not all about destiny,becoming a millionaireis not something thatyou don't know but all otherrich people know all about it!It is simply not falling intothe trap of what the worldlays out for you,because every day,this world is stopping youfrom becoming a millionaire.Banks are advising you totake more loans,buy more cars,buy more phones,buy more houses,buy more clothes,buy more appliances.Everybody is suggesting,invest your money here,it will be doubled overnight.All of this is a way for youto not become a millionaire.But if you stay disciplined,if you say no to all the noise,and invest, and pay yourself firstthan paying others,it is inevitable my friend,that you would have â¹1 crorefor you to enjoy life.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
