In 10 minutes, I will share9 personal finance rules with youwhich are important for youif you want totake charge of your money.Before starting the video,a big shout-out to Harshilwho sent me an emailthat he got a whatsapp forwardaround these9 personal finance rules.I really liked them,so I thought of makinga video on them.So thank you Harshil,and thanks to everybodywho keeps sharing feedback with me,because that's the way I keephelping all of you guys.Well, let's get started.Number 1: The rule of 72.It is a fundamental rulebut a very useful rule.In how many years willyour money double?You have to divide 72 bythe rate of interest you earn every year.Let's say. you get an interestof 10%, then your money willdouble in 7 years,which is 72 divided by 10.If you have invested in an FD,then as per 5%, your moneywill double in 14 years.If you are earning 20%,doing whatever investmentsthat you are doing,then your money will doublein 3.5 years only.Rule number 72:In how much time does yourmoney double?Based on this, rule number 2:The inflation adjustment rule,called the rule of 70.If you want to know inhow many years will the valueof your money decrease,then you can divide 70by the inflation rate.Nowadays, the inflation rateis around 5-6%,let's take it as 6%.This means, 72 divided by 6,which is 12, so your moneywill reduce to half in 12 years.If you have â¹100 with youand you keep it with yourself only,then after 12 years,with that â¹100,you will be able to buy thingsworth â¹50 only as of today's price.This tells you the importanceof continuously keep savingand also beating inflation.Rule number 3:The 4% withdrawal rule.A lot of people ask me,'When you invest,then how and when do youwithdraw money,how much do you withdraw?'And there comes this 4% rule.First, multiply all youryearly needs, your expenses by 25,to figure out how much moneywould you need at thetime of retirement,because that is approximatelythe time you will liveafter retirement.Suppose your annual expenseis â¹5 lakhs, and your retireat the age of 50 or 60,then you would need â¹1.25 croresat that age,which is â¹5 lakhsmultiplied by 25.When you will retirewith this corpus,then you will withdraw 4% every year,which is the amountthat you need to live life.So you keep withdrawing4% every year.Hopefully, your â¹1.25 croreswill still keep growing,in whatever investments you have made.It could be debt, equity,a combination of both,but basicallywhat you have to do is,every year after retirement,start withdrawing 4%of your total corpus,while the corpus keepsearning interest.Rule number 4:The 100 minus age rule.It tells you how muchshould you invest in equities.Whatever is your age,subtract it from 100,and whatever number you get,that in percentage ishow much you should allocateto equities.Suppose you are 25 years old,100 minus 25 is 75%.This means, you should invest75% of all the moneythat you invest every monthin equities.It could be direct stocks,mutual funds, smallcase,combinations thereof.But 75% of your owninvestment amountshould go to equities.You can then split theremaining 25% in multipleother assets.You can buy digital gold,corporate bonds, you caninvest some in crypto too,you can park some of it foryour emergency fund too.By the way, investing in FDfor an emergency fundis the right decision.Not to grow, but to protect money.So 100 minus age rulewill tell you how much of yourinvestments should gotowards equities.Rule number 5: The 10-5-3 rule.It is a very simple rulefor you to have reasonableexpectations with thegrowing percentage of yourinvestments post-tax.10 means, assume that yourequity investments will giveyou an annual returnof 10% post-tax.5% is your fixed depositpost-tax return.These days, you don't evenget that much but assume itto be this much.3 is the savings ratethat you get from yourbank annually,where your money is rotting.10-5-3.It is very importantbecause a lot of peoplechase short-term returns,and forget that you earnthe same reasonable returnevery year ona long-term investmentwith great difficulty.So even if you get 10% annually,then your money is doublingevery 7 years,which means for you toactually multiply your moneyby say 16 times,all you need to do isjust stay invested foraround 30 years.That is not a really long time,but your money will growfrom 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 16in just 28 years,if you keep growing yourmoney at 10% every year.Be reasonable aroundthe expectations that you can get,because that will thenallow you to stay invested.If in any year you get20% or 25%,but the next year you get only 15%,that doesn't mean that youare doing poorly, because trust me,even the best investorsacross the world consistentlydeliver 15-20%, not more than that.Rule number 6:One of my favorite rules,the 50:30:20 rule.It is a very powerful budgeting rule.If you do not knowhow to spend your monthly income,then 50% of your moneyshould go towards your needs.It could be your EMI, rent,food, and clothing expenses.All those things which arenecessary for you to live life,that should be within 50%.Then 30% goes towards your desires.It could be a phone, vacation,EMI for your car, whatever is itthat you wish to spend money on,because what fun is itif we just keep investing,and then we have money onlywhen we are old,and we could not do anythingin our youth.So you have to spend money,spend it wisely,and that is why 30%.And 20%, minimum 20%should be invested every month.So, 50% towards your needs,30% towards your wants,and 20% towards your investments.50:30:20 rule.Rule number 7: The six X rule.Before startingany kind of investment,you should have at least6 months of expensein your emergency fund.If you do not have it,then you are actuallytaking a big risk.In addition to this,I will add two more things.Health insuranceand life insurance.Health insurance,because God forbidif anything happens to youor your family members,then all your savings can vanishby paying hospital bills.This is the biggest learningfor us from the past 2 years.Don't let that happen to you.And life insurance,because God forbid if anythinghappens to you or yourmain earning member,then all the burden of your loansshould be borne by your family.So in the unfortunate eventof you passing away,you should leave your familywith financial protectionfor which life insuranceis important.But beyond that,the six X rule,which is to multiplythe monthly expense foryour needs by 6,this should beyour emergency fund.And you can split thisemergency fund in whatis called 70:20:10.70% will be in a fixed deposit,which is secure there.20% in your savings account,from which you can withdrawat any time.And 10% in cash,so that in case ofany immediate need,you can withdraw that moneyor at least tap into that money,because it is lying somewherein your drawer or cupboard.Rule number 8: The 40% rule.The 40% rule tells youthat if you have anyongoing loan EMIs,then the total of all theloan EMIs should bewithin 40% of your salary.If more than 40% of your salaryis going towards loan EMI,then you are over-leverage.This means, you have more loansthan you need,and that is going to suck you inbecause all your savingsare vanishing by payingthe interest on those loans,and you are not gettinga chance to investaccording to the 50:30:20 rule,because you have to live your life,you have to fulfill your desires,and then you are not leftwith any money to invest.So the longest timeyou spend on paying the loan,is the time you are awayfrom investing, and because of that,you are delaying your investmentseven more,and you are not going to retirewith the money that youneed to retire with.And finally rule number 9:The 25 X rule.It tells you that wheneveryou buy life insurance,then you should multiplyyour annual income by 25,and that should be yourideal life insurance cover.So, if your annual incomeis â¹5 lakhs,then you should takea life cover of â¹1.25 crores,so that god forbidif anything happens to you,your family will get â¹1.25 crores,which would be enough for themto manage themselvesfor the next 25 yearsif they invest properly.If nothing happens to youand the term ends,then you would get the premium paid,and basis the amountthat you have chosen,whether it is a capital guaranteed plan,endowment plan, any investment plan,ULIP, etc., whatever the choiceis it that you have made,you will get a returnaccording to that,but the life insurance coverbare minimum should be 25 timesyour annual income.So these werethe 9 personal finance ruleswhich are important for you totake charge of your
