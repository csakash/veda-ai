If you have stopped your SIPsafter the recent poor performanceof the stock market,then this video is for you.Friends, I've been making videosfor the past 2-2.5 years,but now is the true test,because for the past 2 years everythingwas going great,the stock market was rising,crypto was rising,everything was working out well,people had started investing,they were getting positive returns.In the past 6 months,when people were truly tested,then people got scared!Almost every day, people write mea message or an email that,'I have stopped my SIPs,we are waiting for the market to recover.'And I am making this videofor those people only.If you are scared becauseof the fluctuations of 2022,and that's why you have stopped your SIPs,then it is very important for youto watch this video.In fact, if you are continuingwith your SIPs,but you feel that you are the only fool,everyone else has stopped it,and only you continue to invest your moneyin a bad market,then this video is for you as well,because I want to give comfortto all of you through this video.Mathematically, through an excel sheet,I will try to show that SIPsare the best and the most powerful toolsfor wealth creation,especially if you use them ina bear market or the current down market.For that, we go into data.We will look at the historical datafor the last two years, 2021 and 2022,and we will assume that you have donea monthly SIP with absolute dedication,and because of that,how did it really work?What was a big difference thatthe ups and downs market made?But before that,a brief definition of SIP?What is SIP?The full form of SIP isa Systematic Investment Plan.This basically is the best way for anyinvestor to make long-term investments.A disciplined investing where every monthyou cull out a portion from your incomeand invest it separately,and you do this every monthwith absolute dedication.So it's almost likeyou receive your salary,and then give it away to someone.Who is that person?Your future self.You are doing all this wealth creationfor that person,you are creating independencefor that person, so that hopefully,you can retire early,you have a big corpus with whichyou can fulfill all your desires.A lot of people don't do this.What do they do?They either trade, which meansthey take short-term bets on the price,that a particular stock will go fromhere to there, and I will bet on that,and I will make money in that movement.Or people invest in a lump sum.'I think the market is down right now,let's invest â¹2 lakhs.I think the market is up right now,let's sell for â¹2 lakhs.'Both of these things could workbut it requires a lot of research,it's very technical,it takes a lot of time,it requires a lot of homework and time,which at least I don't have,I think even you don't,so the safest way and thus the best wayfor people like you and I becomesthat you invest every monthwith absolute dedication.When that happens, it follows somethingcalled the cost averaging process.I will tell you whatthe cost averaging processis through the excel sheet,but it is a powerful techniqueto prove that you don't have to rackyour brains for it,you don't have to bother aboutthe fluctuations of the market,when to invest,and in which stock to invest.You basically bet on the indexor a group of stocks,and you invest every month,and your returns are determinedby the fluctuation of the market.How?Let's go to the excel sheet.The first thing I did was I went tothe website of National Stock Exchange.It has great historical dataon every index.So these are the indexes that you canbuy or sell on National Stock Exchange.Nifty 50 is one of the most popular ones,you bet on the top 50 stocks of Indiaor Nifty, National Stock Exchange.These are very stable stocks likeReliance, Tata, Asian Paints, Infosys,Wipro, the usual suspects.Since these are big companies,there is not a lot of fluctuation,and it keeps growing consistentlyin value.Then the other approach could be thatyou can go for the Nifty 500 multi-capwhich is very interesting.It has 500 companies from which250 companies would be large-cap,the companies valued higherthan â¹20,000 crores,25%, around 125 companieswould be mid-cap,these are the companies valuedbetween â¹5,000 to â¹20,000 crores.And then 25% again,which is again 125 companieswould be small-cap,the companies valued lesserthan â¹5,000 crores.So it is a mix and if you invest in it,then you get the stability of 50%of large-cap companies,but also the growth of 25%of small-cap companies.By definition, small-cap companieswould be very volatile,there would be a lot of fluctuation.There would be someWarikoo Engineering Company.Who knows when it will shut down or not,how much profit it will make,what would be its revenue growth,very unpredictable because it is stillat a small scale.So you would bet on it becauseit could give you a great returnin a 5-10-20 year period,but there would be a lot of fluctuationas well.So how do you balance that?You balance that with 50% of large-cap,that could be there.And then there is a Nifty mid-cap 50.Mid-Cap companies meanmedium size companies,its top 50 stocks.We tracked these 3 indexes,I took out their data for 2021 and 2022,and then I put them on an excel sheet.You can see here, these are the numbersfor Nifty 50.I have assumed we will invest onthe 5th of every month, hopefully,we receive our salary by then.If the 5th is not a trading day,then the next day,it could be 7th or 8th as well,but that doesn't meanyou did not invest on the 5th.It means you bought stockson the earliest trading opportunityafter the 5th, and let's assumethat you invest â¹10,000 every month.So I will enter â¹10,000in all of the months.We started investing on 5th January 2021,and we made our last investmenton the 5th of August 2022.You smartly invested every monthwhether the market was up or down,you did not bother and kept going.How does it translate?In the first month, January 2021,when you invested â¹10,000,the value of the index of Nifty 50at that time was â¹14,199.Let's assume that it is its price as well.Of course, when you buy actualmutual funds of Nifty 50,its price is quite less.It's called NAV or Net Asset Value.It is around â¹10-20,but let's assume its price was â¹14,199because that is the movementthat will happen.And since you invested â¹10,000,how many units did you get?0.7 units.You did the same thing everywhere.Now, what's interesting?The interesting thing is wheneverthe market goes down,let me do the month-on-month movement.Whether the market went up fromone month to the next month or down?Let me put that up in a percentage form.So this is interesting.Let's look at April,in the month of April,the market went down by 2%.What does this mean?This means that the valueof the market when down,but your â¹10,000 bought more units.You bought 0.68 unitsinstead of 0.67 units.Then the market went down in Decemberby 6.4%, so with those â¹10,000,the last month you bought 0.55 units,and this month you bought 0.59 units.So, at the end of this entire period,you have a total of 12.31 units.And now what is the value of these12.31 units?The current value,which is â¹17,397,we will multiply that with 12.31,so that's â¹2,14,000.How much money did we invest?â¹2 lakhs,which means over this entire period,we earned â¹14,000.This is despite the fact thatthe market is down,this is despite the fact thatthe market went up too.It did not make any difference to youbecause you kept investing every month,and despite that,you are sitting on a profit.That is the simple power of SIP.This means that your net returnwas this divided by this minus one,your absolute return till now is 7.1%.It is more than fixed deposit,beats inflation,and this is despite the fact thatthe market is  regularly going downfor the past 6 months.Look at this movement,it is 3.7% in February, 7.3% in March,then 7% in May, then 2%, 3%,down!Despite all these down trendsyou are sitting on a positive 7.1%.This is the power of SIP.Technically, this videoshould end at this pointWithin around 8 minutes,I must have convinced you thatSIP is how you should think about itbecause it takes the least of your time,the least of your brain,and it still ensures positive returnsmore often than not.This is just the 18-month journey,when you will do this for 5-10 years,it will blow your mindthat how much value you will be ableto create for frankly nothing.Now let's consider the same thingin mid-cap.In mid-cap, here it is,and let me just zoom in.Here's mid-cap.In mid-cap,these are medium size companies,we have considered the top 50 companies,and we bought a total of23.91 units of mid-cap.Again, exactly the same principle.When the market went down,and let me just bring theweek-on-week movement as well.When the market went down,we were able to buy more units.So the market went down by 1.8% in April,so last month, we bought 1.26 units,and this month, we bought 1.28 units.In January 2022,the market went down by 13%,last month, we bought only 1.01 units,and this month, we bought 1.17 units.Let's calculate what the value is.So, 23.91 into the current value,which is 1.96.This means that over this 18-month period,your SIPs have given negative returnstill now.You invested â¹2 lakhs,and those â¹2 lakhs reduced to â¹1.96 lakhs,which is a decline of 1.6%.Now this may not be something thatyou are ok with, and you are like,'If this is how it will be,then I don't want to invest in mid-cap,because by definition, mid-cap is riskierthan a Nifty 50 index.'But many people say,'No! If we see mid-cap at 20 months only,then it will never make sense,because mid-cap is journey of 5-10 years.'The choice is completely yours.Your risk profile determineshow and where you want to play,but at the end of it, you'll still seethat despite so much decline,mid-cap is only 1.6% down.So, if you can digest this,great for you!I will suggest not to invest 100% of yourmoney in mid-cap,and that's why the third option which is,multi-cap.Multi-cap is where 50% goes in large-cap,25% in mid-cap, and 25% in small-cap,and hopefully, this mitigates the risk.Let's see what the numbers tell us.We will copy and paste this,and zoom in.So, you will see that we have22.37 units.And the value of these 22.37 unitstoday is â¹2.15 lakhs,which is higher than Nifty's 2.14.Interesting!So what did you do?You suddenly were able to generateslightly higher returns,instead of 7.1%, you earned 7.9% returns.Again, this is over a period ofthese 20 months.So, you are 7.9% positive,despite the market being so decliningin the last several months.And you increased your â¹2 lakhsto â¹2.15 lakhs.How?By diversifying into a multi-cap approach.I recently made a video onstock market investing,and especially mutual fund investingin it, where depending on your risk,if you are a high-risk individual,medium-risk or low-risk individual,then how can you manage your riskand invest in the stock market,and that can be an approach for youto take into account.The bigger thing that I want to shareis how these â¹10,000, without you knowing,which company to invest in,which stock to pick,what should be the research,to give it your time and brains,to try models on it,all this is not our expertise.There is someone else who isan expert at this, they have beendoing it for years, and they know it.So, why wouldn't you use them, trust them,and do an SIP.Nobody has paid me to say this,this is what I have been doingall of my time becauseI do not know how to time the market,and it is ridiculous that I get so manymessages now saying that,'We stopped our SIPs at a bad time becausewe are waiting for better times.'That's exactly the oppositeof what you should be doing.And wherever you will seea negative return, there the benefitis that you are getting bigger orhigher units than what you could havepurchased in the previous month,because the market went down.So, when the market goes downand you are betting on an index,you are actually getting more valuethan usual because when the marketwill rise up again, then the value ofthose units would have increased,and you would have more units to display,and thus to create a high return.This is the simple explanation of SIP.Whether you invest in Nifty 50,mid-cap, samll-cap, or multi-cap,keep doing SIPs,because if you are not doing thatthen you are unnecessarilybreaking your compounding,and that is not what smart investors do.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
