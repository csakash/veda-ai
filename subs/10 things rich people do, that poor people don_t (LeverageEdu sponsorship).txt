Will go straight into the videoand will get that started right away.Number one:They don't save, they invest.What's the difference?Many people tell you,hey save money, save money.Saving money is one thingbut what is to be done by saving it?So people after saving moneyput it in the bank.Worse book an FD.So better not save that money at all.Basically, whenever you keep your moneyjust in a bank,or even if you create an FD,So after tax, that money of yours,can't even beat the rate of inflation.Which means every yearthe value of your money is decreasing.Rich people on the other hand,don't just save their money.They save and invest that money.They know, they have only one objective,towards this moneythat is to make this money beat inflation.And that becomes the center focusof how they use their money?Number Two:They buy expensive, high-quality itemsbecause they knowthat long term benefits are more.Penny wise, pound foolish.Have you heard this saying?When we don't have much moneyso we think that if we buy cheap things,we save money.But what we fail to recognize is,maintaining the cheap things,to live with themis also going to be a depletionof our money, of our time,of our resources.If you buy cheap products,buy low-quality product,so they will break quickly, spoil quicklyand worse, they won't workfor the task you bought them for.You go to a cheap gymthere will be no impact.Will take tuitions with a cheap teacher,there will be no impact.Will take a cheap course,Will not be able to get proper learningfrom there.Everything is not a value of just money.You have to also measure qualityand rich people saythat if for very good qualitywe also have to pay a lot of money,we will hold back something elsebreak something elsewill put money there.Because we knowits return of investmentwill be significantly higher.They are not penny wise, pound foolish.Number 3:Any cost incurredon health, food, learningis never questioned.They understandgood health, good food,and being able to investin your own learningis the best use of money.So, they eat really well.Don't eat a lot of junk food.They definitely invest a lotin their health.Whether it's good trainers.Whether it's good gym.Whether it is a good exercise regimen.And they investvery regularly in their learning.For example,every year I act as per a budget.Everything has a budget.There is travel budget.There is clothing budget.There is a budget for household expenses.Everything has a budget.Only one thing doesn't have a budget.To buy books and online courses.I can buy as many books as I want.I can do as many online courses.My money will never fall short on this.If I have to stop something elseand put money on this, I would,because I know that this helps mein my overall growth.Talking about learningso a lot of people go abroad to studyso that they get the best educationand can help their country backwhen they are qualified professionals.UK is a great destinationto go and study abroad.UK admissions for this yearare going to close in Septemberand this is now the last month for youto apply and get enrollmentin a top UK University.If you are interested in UKwant to go and study therebut you are not surein which universities, in which programs,how will financial assistancebe available,how will visa support be available,all of this can be taken care of,by Leverage Edu.This video is sponsored by Leverage Eduwhich is one of India's largeststudy abroad consultantsand assistance platformwhere everythingfrom your statement of purposeto your test prep, to your applications,will be taken care of and you can relyon their expert support.There is a linkin the pinned comment and description,where you can go and set upa free counseling sessionthrough Leverage Edu.Number 4:Rich people wait and wait patientlyfor good deals.They don't get emotional.They don't get excited to spend money.They know that moneyis very, very important.So they know when will be the right timefor them to deploy the money.And they just patiently wait for that.Whether it's an investorwho will wait for a particular stockto come at a good value,or he may be a buyer, who would knowthat on this salethings are available at the right price,You get the right thing at this shop.This product can be boughtat a good price after waiting for 1 year.All of this makes them smartabout their moneyand that is how they think of a purchase.Whether it's investment,whether it's consumption.Number Five:They are fugal.But when I say this,many people say, hey,rich people and frugal.What are you saying, mate?Man, it is very importantto understand one thing.That moneyis not the same for every person.For example,if your annual salary is â¹5 lakhsand you want to buy a car worth â¹10 lakhs.So what is the ratio of the car's valueto your annual value?2:1, which means, your annual incomeand the thing you want to buyhas twice the difference.So, it is obviousthat you will take a loanand will fund that and so on. Perfect.There is a personwhose annual salary is â¹1 croreand now he buys a car worth 20 lakhs.Now what is the ratio of the car's valueto that person's income?1:5, means, only 20% of his yearly income.You are buying a car twice as expensive,They are only buying 20%of their annual income.Now, it would seemthat hey, if the car is worth 20 lakhs,then how do you become frugal?That's not the way to think about it.The way to think about this is,of their entire income or net worthwhat percentagedo they spend on this thing?That is frugality.They recognize what thingholds what kind of importanceand how much should be spent for that?Here's a good example.And sorry I am giving my example.It's not like being very rich or anything,But it will put things in context.Last year our business earned â¹27 crore.Me and my wife togethertake a salary of 50 lakhs each.Which means our annual household incomeis â¹1 crore.With that â¹1 croreand with this 27-crore business,we can afford any car, any car.But even then,we drive a car worth â¹10 lakhs on rent.Whose monthly rent is â¹25,000.We could've even bought that car,but we didn't buyBecause we knowthat taking that 25,000 car on rentis economically smarter.The car is the same.The car holds only one purpose for megoing from point A to point Band I don't care how long is she,how wide is she and how expensive.The only difference it makes to meis whether it is safeand whether it is comfortable.And as long as that is the case,I am happy in any car that there is.Now what is happening by that?I am saving money.I am not spending my carin buying a Mercedes or a BMWor a Lamborghini or whatever, Porsche.I am spending my moneyon the right things.I spend my money on good travel.I spend my money on good hotels.I spend my money on my health,my fitness.I spend my money on my learningand that's what gives methe best use of my moneyas somebody who has money.So frugality is the nature of rich people.And you always have to compare itas a percentage of what they can affordnot the absolute valueof what they have got.Number 6:They run on budget.This is a shocker. But this is true.It doesn't happen that money is justfalling out of the pockets of rich people,being thrown away,are not able to handle at all.They are always awarethat where their money is going,how much is goingand is it within the budget and not.The difference is becausethey have so much money,their budgets are also huge.So it seems thatthey are spending money indiscriminately,on weddings, on travel.But everything is part of a budget.Last year we spentclose to about â¹5-6 lakhs only on travel.Only on travel.But it was within the budget.Last year, in fact, I made a whole videoof how much money I spent in 2022.Where all, by making a full budget.And that's the waythat we manage our money.We know where every penny is going,Why is it going,and what is going to happen by it?And that allows usto take a grip of our money.Make sure that our moneyis being spent in the right way.And that ensures that our moneyis always working for us.We are not working for money.Number Seven:Rich people are always diversifyingand expanding their income.People know that there are two waysto make money.You earn more and you save more.That is the surest way to becoming rich.You will keep earning more and more.Save as much as possible and invest itAnd from that you will become rich.So the first part of this is,you will make more and more moneyAnd you cannot make moneyfrom just one salary.You will have to createmultiple income streams.Whatever that is.When you investyou create an income stream.Whether the income stream is real estate.Whether the income streamis you have bought gold.Income stream is you buy any stock.Income streamis you are getting dividends from stocks.The income streamis that you had bought an assetand by selling it,you are getting an incomeand you are investing it back.Whatever the case may be.Or you have opened a side business.Or you have created intellectual property?You write books.You are making money from it.Or you sell your design.Sell your music. Sell your artOr you run courses?Anything that allows you to generatemultiple income streamsor create multiple income streamsand add to your total incomeis what rich peopleare constantly thinking of.An until that mentalitydoesn't come inside you,you can't become rich.Can give in writing with a claim.Number Eight: Very Important.They surround themselves with peoplethat they would want to be.The company they haveis the people they want to be.And this is such an important partof the equation.We often live by this mindsetthat we have to live with those,who were always with us.And that's a very, very noble thought.But in the equation of lifesometimes it doesn't work.Because there are some peoplewho cannot grow like us.There are some peoplewho cannot grow like us,and then try to stop us.Some people whenever they meet us say,you've changed, you've changed.You are not the same You've changed.And what they are doing subconsciouslyis making you feel guiltyfor actually growing really fast.I recently tweeted,That you start taking your life seriously,and you start losing friends.They weren't really your friends,They were hollow friends.They only loved youwhen you were right for them.But the day they saw you running fast,saw your life changing,saw you taking your life seriously,they went away.They are like, you have changed.Not hanging out with you.You know what? Good riddance.Surround yourself with the peoplethat you want to be.Learn from those people.Because they will constantlykeep challenging you.You will always feel stupid of yourself.You'll feel that you do not know anything.You will feel there is how much to learn.But that is singularly what they doto drive their mindset forward.That is the difference between someonewho is rich and somebody who is not.Number Nine:They go against the tide.It is very normal for themto resist the obvious things.When there is a similar situationin front of the whole world,they ask what will the whole world doon an average?And then they realize and rememberthat investinghas a very fundamental principlethat if you invest in the one such thingthat everyone knows everything about,then your returns will be same as others.If you invest with the knowledgethat everybody else has,your returns will be equalto everybody else's.So the only way to get high returnis to do somethingthat the others are not doing.This is called resisting the obvious.You have to work differentlyfrom the obviousAnd that doesn't meanthat it's right or wrong.It just meansthat you are giving yourself a chance,to do something bigger and betterthan everybody else.If it works, great. If it doesn't,I'll come to the last point,because that is the mostimportant point of all.But the ninth point is rich peopleare always going against the tide.They are always resisting the obvious.Number 10:When you resist the obvious,when you go against the tidelike I told youIt is not necessary that,that thing will always work.It is not necessary that they knowwhat is going to work or not. No.That will only happen once they do it.But what they recognize,which is so powerfulis the losses they have are capped,Think about it for a second.If you are watching this video on YouTube,on your phone,through a high-speed internet connection,then it is obvious thingthat you if you do anything in your life,You will not die of hungry and bare.You will not come on the streets.We are born in such privilege,parents gave us love, happiness,gave a roof over the head,taught to read and write, gave food,provided clothing,and because of all those thingsAn opportunity set has come in our lifeby which we can ensurethat we will never diehungry and bare in our life.And that means that whatever you do,whatever you do,that there will be no loss in your life,beyond one levelWhatever your loss is, it is fixed.You'll never go lower than this.But if you win,you can win, beyond infinity.If you win your win can be infinite.It has no limit.There is no limit on that.There is nothing that definesthat you cannot win more than this.You can win however much you want.To play this gameis the trait of rich people.Because they understand that this gamehas to be played every day.Every single day.Every single day.Every single day.I will come up and play this game.One such gamethat I have a 90% chance of losing?But even if I lose, my loss is capped.And the 10% chance if I win,can change my life.And I will play the game every single day.That is the rich person's mindset.That is the winner's mindset.If that winner mindsetdoesn't come in you,if that 90% failure itself scares you,the failure that will notionallytry to scare you,like I told you,You will not die hungry and bare.Will not come on the streets.But there will be a fear inside you.What will people say.People will laugh.I won't be able to buy that expensive car,Won't be able to buy that expensive house.Won't be able to wear expensive clothes.Won't be able to buy that expensive phone.And because of that you will feelthat you are a failure. You are a loser.You couldn't win.Then you are a failure.But if you show yourselfthat, I will do anything my friend.No matter how much I loseI am not going to lose more than this.So will be ready every day only to win.I will play every day to win.Then you will havealways the winner's mindset.And I would lovefor every single one of you to have that,at the end of the dayAnkur Warikoo, signing off.
