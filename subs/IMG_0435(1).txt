If you ask for one financial advicefrom all the rich people,then you will often get this advice,use all your money in buying assets,not liabilities.Assets are the things thatgrow your money,and liabilities are the thingsthat reduce your money.Rich people use their money onlyto buy assets.For example, they buy stocks so thatwith the growth of the businessthe value of the stock increases.They buy real estateso that their value increasesthrough rental income and property prices.They buy businesses so that theygrow more money through business income.But what do we buy?Cars, watches, and clothes,which only reduce money.Don't make that mistake!
