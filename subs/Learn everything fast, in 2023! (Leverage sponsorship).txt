Ways to learn fast in 2023.In 1885, a German psychologist,Hermann Ebbinghaus tried to doa very interesting experiment.He wanted to see how good are memory is,and if we try to learn something randomly,how much of it we remember after how long.And what he discovered came to be known asthe forgetting curve.It essentially says,if we try to memorize anything,then within a week,we are able to remember only 15% of it,it just goes away.And that's why the first methodto learn something new and fastis to revise.When our parentsor teachers or boss ask us to revise,it is actually scientifically backed.If you look at this graph,it is obvious that as you revise,your capability to rememberwill increase.The day you start,do a revision the next day,then again a revision on the third day,then again a revision on the sixth day,that has been scientifically provento retain up to 90% ofwhat you started with.This is the way to destroyor defeat the forgetting curve.Step number one.Step number 2: Active recall.Active recall means a method to reador memorize or understandwhere you try to actively do somethingto increase the recall factor.For example, if you write whateveryou are trying to learnor trying to understand,it has been proven to help youretain more.If you try to teach it to someone,it has been proven to retain more.If you repeat it yourselfin your own voice,that also affects retentionin a positive manner.Or if you make flashcards.What are flashcards?You make small cards justlike playing cards,and you write notes on themso that you can use them to memorize.This is another great way to destroythe forgetting curve.You don't have to revisethe whole subject again.Write the key points on flashcards,and then on the next day,the third day, and the sixth day,use those flashcards and do your revision.And then the best way to of courselearn something new is by doing.If you are learning coding,digital marketing, content writing,or graphic designing,then no matter how much anybodytries to teach you,you will of course learn,but until you don't do it yourself,it will not stay in your mind.So the second way of learningsomething fast is to useactive recall methods.Number 3: Make chunks of information.A very good technique for doing this isthe Pomodoro technique.If you don't know about it,I will quickly explain it.Pomodoro is a 30-minute slabin which you do something for 25 minutesand take a break for 5 minutes,again do something for 25 minutesand take a break for 5 minutes,and again for 25 minutes and 5 minutes.After 4 such Pomodoros,you take a longer break of 30 minutes.This has again been scientifically provento help retention and maximize your focus.Why?Because you divide your workinto 25-minute slabs,and give your mind a 5-minute break,so your retention is high,focus is high,and your brain is able to relaxto come back to that task again.So if you divide your taskin these 25-minute slabs,do 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break,again 4 Pomodoros,then after 8 Pomodoroswhich is around 4 hours of hard work,you will actually be able to retainat a surprisingly high level.Number 4:Whenever you sit down to learn something,you should be ina distraction-free environment.It's very important, friends.If you are phone is with you,there is noise, people are around you,doorbells are ringing,there are a lot of toolsfor distraction around you,some toys, some books,your favorite music is on,then your mind will keep wandering.Simple techniques.Keep your desk or your table clutter-free,it should not be chaotic.If you are listening to music,listen to instrumental music only.Whenever you listen to music with lyrics,your mind pays attentionto singing those lyrics,no matter how bad a singer you are,but your mind gets activated.If your phone keeps pinging,then naturally you will be incentivizedor seduced to check.If you check it once,when you put your hands on it,then who knows how many hourswill be spent on it.Remove all of that.In that 25-minute slabwhich you will hopefully use withthe Pomodoro technique,you should be distraction-free.And then in those 5 minutes,do whatever you wantand then you will enjoy it.And then in the long break of 30 minutes,chill even more, waste time,do whatever you want to do,and then your mind will be at ease,and you will work and learn faster.Number 5:Don't try to memorize things,instead, try to understand them.It's very important.It's called the first principle thinkingor the first principle approach.If you try to memorize anything,then as I said,according to the forgetting curve,within 7 days you will forgetalmost everything,and then you will revise again.But it becomes so boring to revisesomething which is just memorywith no understanding,but if you try to understand,then it's a very different approach.I remember Richard Feynmanwho was a famous physicist,he said,if you see a woodpecker,then you may saythe name of the woodpecker.This woodpecker has four other names.This woodpecker is in 5 more colors.This woodpecker is found in 7 countries.This woodpecker lives forthese many years.This woodpecker eats this.This woodpecker sees this.You may know everythingabout the woodpecker.For that matter, any other bird,any other flower, any other food,any other city, whatever,but you would know all these things,and you still will not be able to knowtruly how a woodpecker looksif you haven't seen it in real life.All you know is bookish knowledge,as much as you can add,but you have no ideawhat a woodpecker really does,how it looks, what is its nature,and anything else.There's a difference between knowingand there's a differencebetween understanding,and it's very important for youto focus on understandingthrough whatever medium,whether it's YouTube videos,through your teachers, talkingto people or discussing with them,getting into the depth of that,and you will be surprised thatwhen you understand something,it stays with you in such a waythat you can never forget it.Next: Pneumonics.Pneumonics is a complicated English word,but to state it simply it meansa shortcut to memorizeor understand something.For example, when I was in school,the planets of the solar system,Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto,sometimes I could remember itand sometimes I forgot it.So somebody told me a great pneumonic.My very educated mother just showed usthe nine planets.If you take the first letter ofeach word of this sentence,my very educated mother just showed usthe nine planets,you will know the initials of the planets,and this is a simple way for youto remember something which mightbe difficult for you to memorize.These are pneumonics.These pneumonics exist in every fieldin some other way.So when you are learning something,use them because our brain understandsthese patterns better as againstMercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,blah blah blah.Next:It's very interesting.It's scientifically proven that peoplewho are able to visualize informationare able to retain it better.What does visualization mean?When you close your eyes,whatever you want to learnor understand or memorize,you try to create an image of it,form a pattern, form connections,then your brain will retain this better,because our imagery memoryis far better than our auditory memoryor verbal memory.And that's why if you try to learn onlythrough words, it will not be easy,but if you try to convert it intoa pictorial or an image form,which will only be in your mind,it's not necessary that you draw it,and you should know drawing or sketching,you will retain better and learn faster.Sleep.Such a great form to learn something.If you are mind and body are rested,its ability to absorb new informationis that much higher.If your mind and body are tired,no matter how much new informationyou give them, they will not absorb it.It will just mug it up, and at some point,it will start rejecting it,and that is the reasonthe forgetting curve comes into play.So if you can rest your body,which doesn't necessarily meanthat you have to sleep at night only,power naps are a great thing.I still remember,during my business school,since there is so much work for usto do in a business school,we are awake for 18-20 hours,and we have no idea about day or night,I used to take these 15-minute power naps,where I used to set an alarm and wake upafter 15 minutes,and that became such a habit because,in the beginning, it was very tough.That 15 minutes of sleep was overpowering,and you just don't want to get up,but if you train your mind toanyhow wake up after 15 minutes,then you start getting used to it,and then in those 15 minutes,you instantly get so much energy and powerthat you are back at the gamewith a very different level of effort.We have five senses, and if we useas many senses as possibleto learn this new thing,we will retain more.If we are only reading,then we will retain lesser.And the best way to prove that iswhen you try to read a book,as you start reading, you feel sleepyand that's it, you are gone!If you are only listening to something,that is at another level only.We listen to so many thingsduring the day, and we can't remembermore than half the thingsnor are they able to knockour minds in any way.If you are doing somethingonly by speaking,it is also not enough.If you are only doing something,it is also not enough.If you are doing something by tasting,it is also not enough.But if you are seeing, listening,and speaking,not different things, the same thing,if you are reading a book,and then again reading it to yourself,and then again listening to it,or maybe you are recording it,and after one day,you are listening to your recording again,they are activating your senses,and your retention will be higher,and you will learn faster.Asking questions has been provento encourage and make you learnnot just faster but even better.The more questions you ask,the more clarity you will havebecause you ask questions onlywhen you want to learnand understand something.So as long as you are askingmore and more questions,you know your questionsare also getting progressively deeper,and you are trying tounderstand that better.This also goes back tothe first principle approach.Why does the first principle approachor understanding instead of knowing work?Because you ask questions.Why is the moon round?Why do Earth and Moon revolvearound each other?Why do they both revolve around the sun?Why does the solar system revolvearound the universe?Is there a center of the universe?Is there a boundary of the universe?What is the age of the universe?What was there before?When you start asking these questions,you get so much fundamental clarity,not just about the universe,but anything that you want to knowthat now you are not tryingto learn or memorize somethingby mugging it up,you understand it welland its stays with you.And finally, learning style.As I said, the more our sensesare activated, the better we will learn.But this is also the reality thatwe all have a sense which is dominant.For example, you could learn fromjust reading or writing or listeningor watching, or doing.It doesn't mean that you can learnonly through one of these 5 ways.No!It means that out of these 5 ways,there is one way which is fittest for you,and understanding that learning styleis the key tolearn more and learn fast,because you will lead with that style.If reading is your dominant style,then you will lead by reading.If watching is your dominant style,then you will lead by watching.If writing is your dominant style,then you will lead by writing.And you will also activate other senses,but you know for a fact that you have keptyour dominant learning stylein the forefront,and you are using thatas the foundation to learn everything new.This year, through all these techniques,you will not just learn somethingthat you need to learn,but you will also learn new things.With this hope,Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
