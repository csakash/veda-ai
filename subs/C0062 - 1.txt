Alright check 1 2 check 1 2Let's get startedOkIn this video, I will share 10 questionswith you, which you must ask beforebuying health insurance for yourselfand your family.Friends, I have spoken a lot abouthealth insurance and in this video,I will share 10 questions with youin a very simple manner,which you must ask whenever you wantto buy health insurance,whether it is for yourself,for your parents, for your family.4 out of these 10 questions are questionsyou must ask yourself, and 6 of themare questions which you must ask theinsurance company, plus one bonus questionwhich I will ask all of you at the end.Let's start.First question, when you buyhealth insurance for yourself,your family, your parents,then what should be the cover amount?A lot of people think in terms of amount,but especially in the last 1-1.5 years,when covid was at its peakall over the world, it becameobvious that the right way tothink about it is, in the numberof the hospitalization days in a year.Now wherever you live whether in Delhi,Mumbai, a tier 2 or tier 3 city,the rate or expense of hospitalizationvaries in each state.If you go to a city like Gurgaonor Faridabad, where I live, god forbid,if you are admitted to the ICU,then its daily expense can be upto â¹40-50,000, but if you are ina small town, the best hospitalmay cost just around 10-â¹15-20,000,so it's important that wherever you are,in whatever environment, you haveto gauge in how many yearsyou have to cover hospitalization days.In case you are taking health insurancefor your parents, then I take theballpark to be at least a month or 30 daysof hospital cover. If you are takinghealth insurance for yourselfand your family, and assumingthat you are still young,less than 35-40 years of age,then hospital cover of 15-20 daysis absolutely ok.For example, if I live in Delhi-NCRand I know thatthe daily expense of a hospitalcan be â¹25,000, so if I have totake it for my parents for 30 days,then I will take a health insurance coverof â¹7-7.5 lakhs. If I have to take itfor myself and my family,then by multiplying 20 days by 25,I will take around â¹5 lakhs ofhospital expense or health insurance cover.This is in my opinion the right way to approach it.There is a concept of a family floateras well which is important for you to know.A family floater is offered by manyinsurance companies, including Navi,who are the sponsors of this video...AgainIn a family floater, you can clubthe benefits or cover ofhealth insurance of your family.For example, if you have takena family floater plan worth â¹7 lakhs,then for 4 members, you, your spouse,and 2 kids or parents, then any oneof them can use this amountand the rest of the amount isavailable for everyone else as well.So it's not like each of them wouldget â¹1-2 lakhs, the whole familywould get â¹7 lakhs, and then ifyour insurance has a top-up,which is one of the questionsthat I will answer,then it becomes even better.So the most important thing is,a cover of 30 days for parents,a cover of 15-20 days for yourself,multiply it with the hospital rateand get a ballpark number,and that should be your hospital coverage,that should be your health insurance coverage.Second, what is the right ageto take health insurance?Now the most surprising thingthat I hear often in this regard is,'We are young right now,we are in good health,we don't have any illness,then what is the point of takinghealth insurance? We are giving moneyto a health insurance companyevery year when we are not evengoing to a hospital, then why shouldwe take it right now?'But this is precisely why you should.There are two reasons,Number 1, when you are young thenyour premium for the same coveragewill be a lot lesser.So if you want to take a premium of â¹5 lakhs...So if you want to take a coverof â¹5 lakhs, then the premiumyou will have to pay at theage of 25 will be far far lesserthan at the age of 35 for the same cover.So it is important that the earlierwe take health insurance for ourselvesand our family the better it is,especially when it comes to parents,because when parents are above 60then they qualify as elderly citizensand that increases their premium.So if you can take health insurancefor your parents at the age of 55-58,then you gain from the second pointthat I am mentioning and that is,no claim bonus.If you are young and the probabilityof your hospitalization is low,then you will get a no claim bonusfor the years that you will notclaim the insurance amount forhospitalization, and that keepsgetting added to your cover,so you get more cover for thesame premium in the next yearand the next year and the next year.This is a brilliant thing for parentsbecause the more cover that parents get,the better and vital it is.Of course, it is as much importantfor you, so please buyas early as possible.And health insurance should befor each and every family member.Like only one member of the familytakes life insurance,who is the earning member of the family,the other family members,who are dependents, take thislife insurance as a benefit,but health insurance is one such product,an insurance product whicheach and every member of the familymust have.Number 3, should you take thesame insurance on the same policyfor yourself and your parents?Now, this is a tricky question.I personally believe that theinsurance for parentsand for you should be separate.Here's the reason why.Whenever you take health insuranceas a group or as a family,then the premium is determinedon the basis of the eldest member.So if you are taking insurancefor yourself, your spouse,and your parents, then theeldest member of the family,it can be your father, your mother,the premium will be determinedaccording to them, which meanssince you are young, still,you will be paying a lot ofpremium just because your parentsare attached to the same insurance.Personally, I have taken separateinsurance for my parentsand separate insurance for myselfand my family. The important thingto note here is, that the insurancefor parents has to cover a lot moredetails because they are aged,the probability for theirhospitalization is more,they have pre-existing diseases, so on.And thankfully, since we are stillyoung at 41 years of age, still healthy,the probability of hospitalizationis low, it helps us because it helpsus reduce the premium, we get moreno claim bonus, so on and so forth.So my personal recommendation would be,to take separate insurance for parents andseparate insurance for yourself and your family.And number 4, you work ina company and you alreadyhave corporate health insurance,should you take an additionalinsurance policy or not?My answer is yes.Why?Whenever you leave the companyyour health insurance gets lapsed.You cannot carry it to the next company.So all your no claim bonusesand your cover, all lapsewhen you resign.You do not want that.So in addition to the corporatehealth insurance, you must haveyour own health insurance as well.It is a healthy trait anda healthy habit to have.These were the four questionsthat you have to ask yourself.Now, 6 questions that you haveto ask the insurance companyor whenever you are evaluatinga policy, then you have to keepthem in mind to decidewhether you should take it or not.First, very important,are pre-existing diseasesor PEDs covered? And if they arecovered then what is theirwaiting period?What are PEDs are andwhy are they important?A lot of people already have illnessesbefore they take their health insurance,especially when it comes to parents,they could have diabetes, thyroid,any critical illness like cancer,so on and so forth, and health insurancecovers all these but after a waiting period.There are some policies thatdo not cover them at all. They say,if you have a pre-existingthen we will not cover it,so if you get hospitalizedbecause of that then we willnot cover any expense.Now, this clearly is a veryimportant aspect.So two things, insurance must cover PED,this is something that is very importantand waiting period should be the least.For example, in Navi, if you haveany PED or pre-existing diseasesand if you are less than 40 years,then within one year your PEDswill be covered, which means,God forbid if you have any illnesswhich you had before you boughtthe health insurance, and yourage is less than 40, then withinone year that disease will alsobecome a part of your health insurance.If you are greater than 40,then this waiting periodbecomes 3 years.Now, that is very important,not just for you, but also foryour parents to determine,which is why it is a veryimportant question to ask.Number 2, when you arehospitalized, then yourroom rent is also covered aspart of your health insurance.A lot of insurance policieshave a limit on them,which is usually 1% of theinsurance amount. So if youhave an insurance policy ofâ¹5 lakhs then the limit foryour room rent would be 1%which is â¹5000.So any room which is less thanâ¹5000 and if that is the onlyroom available in the hospital,or if you want the patient tostay in that room, then youwill get reimbursement for up to â¹5000,you will have to bearthe remaining expense.Now, that becomes importantbecause many insurance companieswhich put a limit to the room rent,they reimburse all the otherexpenses also on a prorated basis.This means, if your room is for â¹6000and your limit is â¹5000 thenyou will be paying â¹1000,which will be 1 upon 6000,which is approximately 15%,then you will have to bear 15% ofthe rest of the expense as well.Now that is not something thatyou want, and that's why you wantan insurance policy that doesn'thave a limit on the room rent.For example, Navi.In every health insurance productby Navi, there is no limit forthe room rent, which is what youwould want because you don't knowwhich hospital would you get admitted to,for what reason, and which room wouldbe available for you at that point.Third, how many times can I claimthis health insurance in one year?And that follows up with a veryinteresting question about top-up,which is a phenomenal featureavailable only in few policies.First, there can be no limit,because you cannot plan when youwill go to the hospital,or when you would need to go there,so you should have a policywith unlimited claimsso that you can avail it asmany times as you need in a year.In addition to that, some insurancepolicies like Navi, give a freeand unlimited top-upwhich is very interesting.So, suppose you have takena policy of â¹5 lakhs and youhad to go to the hospital forthe first time, and the expensefor it was â¹2 lakhs.Now you are left with only â¹3 lakhsand God forbid, if a situationemerges where you have to go tothe hospital twice,and the expense is â¹2 lakhs every time,then all your â¹5 lakhs moneywould be gone.In this case, Navi gives a free,unlimited top-up which meansif you spend â¹2 lakhs out ofyour cover of â¹5 lakhs,then the remaining 3 will againcome back to 5, and it willhappen free of cost andunlimited times, which meansif you have to claim forhospital expense from insurancea few numbers of times in a year,you can do that without any worryof running out of your cover amount.Number 4, extremely important,network of cashless hospitalsaround you.This is a very important point.Many insurance policies say thatwe have thousands of cashlesshospitals in our network.Great!How many of them are near you?Because when you would be in need,then it should be near your house.Navi has about 10000 plus hospitalscovered which is one of the largestcoverages of cashless hospitalswhich means when you go thereyou don't have to give any moneyfrom your pocket, you will directlygo in for the reimbursement process,and your bill will be settled betweenthe hospital and the insurance company.On top of it, Navi claims thatmost of their reimbursementsor claims are settled within30 minutes itself, of course,there would be exceptions,but for any company to be ableto execute that on an averagewithin 30 minutes is phenomenal,because I have personally gonethrough this situation many times,where you have to wait for hoursfor the insurance amount to get cleared,despite the fact that you have cashless.Number 5, the reason you aretaking health insurance is that,you want that whenever you haveto go to the hospital, somebody elsewho should bear the expense for it,and you are taking insurance against that.But the bigger thing is thatyou want to remain healthy.So an important question to ask is,whether health check-ups and OPDsare covered in your policy or not?Because in every policy only IPDor hospitalization is covered.There are very few policiesin which OPD, which means anormal consultation with the doctor,where we are prescribed somemedicines but there is nohospitalization involved,but of course, there is anexpense for consultation oranything else we need to get done,so what Navi what offers is,number 1, free health check-uponce every year, which is greatbecause you want to keep yourselfmeasured on every aspect,that nothing is going wrong,and if it is then you can prevent it.And number 2, to free onlineOPD consultation which is great.So you can consult the doctor online,there is no expense attached to it,and this is a fantastic wayfor you to save, not just onyour hospitalization,but also for your consultationson a normal basis.And number 6, extremely important,claim settlement ratio.The claim settlement ratio isnot the same for every insurance company.What is the claim settlement ratio?Out of 100 claims that they get,how many are settled?Anything above 95% is mandatory.You should never go for lowerthan this because that tells youthat the settlements of thisinsurance company are mostly met.The other thing is theclaim settlement ratio...The other thing is the amountof settlement ratio which meansif I have claimed â¹100, then how muchwas actually reimbursed from the claim,reimburse or cashless.This is also an important metricbecause it is possible thatthough 97 out of 100 claims wereprocessed, but the 3% of claimswhich were not processed, wasbecause they were very expensiveor the bill was too high,then it doesn't serve anypurpose, right?So it is important that youcheck both these metrics,that how many claims are settled,and how much amount is settledbecause that is a very important metric.IRDA, which is the government-regulatedinsurance authority, that maintainsa public profile of all theinsurance companies around thesetwo metrics, which you can checkwhenever you want, the link isin the comment below.And final bonus question,this is the 11th questionafter all the 10 questions.It is a very new phenomenon,but it is important to askbecause it gives youa lot of control.The one big thing abouthealth insurance, especiallywhen you take it at an early age,which is what I have recommended,is that you have to pay forthe whole year in one go.So whatever is that amount,you have to pay it in a lump sumand you wish that there was a wayfor it to be a monthly process,an EMI like thing, the way we doEMI for eCommerce andthat is for free,so monthly premium paymentsis a flexibility which fewinsurance companies haveintroduced including Navi,where you can convert youryearly premium into monthly premium.There are some minor termsand conditions like,what is the grace period?What is the starting period?If you have not paid a premium thenfor how long will thehealth insurance be live?But these are very small thingsthat you need to bear in mindto get the flexibility ofbeing able to pay monthly.Since you can convert youryearly expense intoa monthly expense, then itgives you that financial discipline,whenever you get your salaryyou make this expense, andwithout even realizing it,slowly and gradually you renewyour health insurance cover,and hence protect yourhealth insurance, your health,your family, against anythingthat is untimely hospitalization.I hope these 11 questionswere useful.If you have any more questions,if you want to know anythingmore around health insurance,around any other questionthat needs an answer,then please ask me in thecomment section, I will sharewith you whatever I know.If you have any questions forthe Navi team, so that you canget direct answers from themthen please ask them alsoin the comment section and...Until the next
