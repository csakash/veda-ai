I receive many emailsand messages which say,âSir, our salary is25,000 rupees a month. We cannot invest a lot.So, it becomes veryeasy for you to say,âThis is how youbecome a crorepati.Invest money here andmagic will happen.âBut nothing happensin 25,000 rupees. It does, my friend.Through this video, I want to show you that through 25,000 rupees, how can you earn in crores. It won't be easy.It will be difficult, but it's not impossible,and your belief can be basedonly on your understanding.As long as you don'tunderstand how it happens, you will never believe that you can do it as well.Let's talk through Excel.Suppose your monthlyincome is 25,000 rupees,and the basic 50-30-20budgeting rule tells us thatwhatever is your monthly income, 20% of it must be invested.So, I have assumed that, butyou can change this number.All the green cells,you can change them.This sheet, by the way,will be tagged in the pinnedcomment and description.So, you can downloadit and play with it. So, I have considered 20%, and it meansevery month, we willinvest 5,000 rupees.So, youâll say,âWhat will we get frominvesting 5,000 rupees a month?We are investing60,000 rupees a year.So, it will take many yearsbefore we become a crorepati.But that is where you makea fundamental mistake.First of all, where to invest?We won't put muchthought into it.Just like I always say,stock picking mustnot be our job.We are not the experts.We do not know whichstock is rising,which stock is falling,why is it rising or falling, and if you know this, then very good.I don't know these things.So, I do not pick stocks.I only invest inportfolio stocks,weather it is a smallcaseor a mutual fund.Now, because weare just starting, we will go for mutual fundswhich will cost lessand require very less understanding to get a certain rate of return.But even in mutual funds,there are different typesof mutual funds.So, which one will you buy?There are mixed, there are hybrid, there are high-growth,there are low-growth, there are midcap,there are smallcap mutual funds.We will adopt3 basic approaches.Number 1: Nifty 50.Nifty 50 is the mutual fundthat invests in India'stop 50 companies.So, you wonât thinkmuch about it.Tata, Reliance, HDFC, SBI, ICICI,the handful of 50 top stocks,you will invest in them, then a certain risk-based return, I won't say guaranteedbut it will be assuredover a long period of time.All the story, by the way, is for a long period of time.Nothing will happen inless than 10-20 years.So, you will have togive it that time.If you are investing for 2-3 years,pause this video and watch something else.So, first of all, we willpick the Nifty 50 Mutual Fund.Number 2 is midcap.What are midcap companies? Midcap are the companies which are between 7,000 croresand 20,000 crores in value.So, a lot of companies which are mid-sized,they are not too big yet, they are not to small,invest in them. But what is the difference?The difference is thatbecause these aremid-sized companies,they come with ahigher amount of risk.So, if there arefluctuations in the economy,or if the interestrates go up or down,or the US dollargoes up or down,or the oil pricegoes up or down,then these companies willexperience way more ups and downs.But TCS, Reliance, HDFC,all the top 50 stocksof nifty 50,they do not fluctuatewith such high margins.So, midcap gives you a tight range of mid-sized companies,but the faster they go up, the faster they might go down. So, they have more risk,which is why these are called volatile mutual funds.Volatility meanshow much it will go up or down, it is a lot,and that is what a midcapmutual fund can give you.Then comes smallcap.Smallcap are the companieswhich are valued lessthan 7,000 crores. So, these are small companies.They might become bigbut the manager ofsmall cap mutual funds,their entire job would beto find and invest in companieswhere they feela good return can be earned.This job can neitherbe done by you nor by me.I don't have any ideaabout which small capcompanies to invest in, but there is a managerwhose entire work profile is this.So, if you look at thereturns of last 10-20 years, you will see that on an average,Nifty 50 has a nice,happy 12% return, midcap gives nearly 15% returns,and small cap givesnearly 18% returns.So, the question arises that whydoesn't everyoneinvest in small cap? Just like I said, the moment the return increases, the volatility will also increase,meaning the faster it will go up, the faster it might come down.So, a lot of upsand downs are there.People get traumatized.That's why, only over along period of time,you should invest inthese mutual funds. So, what I will do isI will make an allocation, and you can choose the allocation. I have kept it free for you,but I would suggest one allocation which I do for myself.60% of this 5,000 rupees, which is 3000 rupees,I would put it inNifty 50 mutual funds,25% in midcap,15% in smallcap.You can make any changes.The sum of these threeshould be 100%because you are investinga total of 5,000 rupees.It depends on you whatyou want to invest.If you want totake a lot of risk,then you can increase midcapand small cap allocation.If you don't want totake a lot of risk,the you can increase the 60%,but there is risk inall of them, my friend. It is necessary to knowbecause this is the stock market.It keeps going up and down.The only thing is overa long period of time,you might earn apredictable return. What is that return?Just like I said,12% from Nifty 50,15% from midcap,18% from smallcap. This is before taxes. It will also be taxedunder the long-term capitalgain tax,whatever would beprevalent at that time. Now, this allocation of60%, 25% and 15%which I have suggested for you,it is your choicewhat you want to do,and after mixingthese returns,you will have an averageof 13.65% return. It means every year,your money willincrease by 13.65%. So, this 5,000 rupeeswill keep increasing at 13.65%.Very good. All good till now? Let's move forward.Now, you will say, âMy salary will also increase.I don't know howmuch it will increasebut it will keep increasing. So, if I commit to it that,"My investment of 5000 rupees, I will increase it too.âI have assumed it to be 10%. It could be more. You can do 5% as well. It's your wish.You can play withall these numbers but this will give you an answer, that is the key,and we will considerthe inflation, which is 6% currently in India,it will be the samefor the future as well.We have put all thesethings in front of us.We started withjust 25,000 rupees.Out of it,only 5,000 a monthwill be our investment. Our commitment is that every year,we will increase that5,000 rupees by 10%. It means next year, for 12 months, we will invest 5,500 rupees. Then the year after that,after adding 550 rupees,we will invest 6,050 rupees, and this will be howyour future will look.Our inflation is 6%.Now, the question arises,what is going to happen? And thisis the result,And this is the result, which is phenomenalwhen you look at thepower of compounding.Let us try tounderstand this chart.This chart saysthat if you are earning25,000 rupees a month,and you are investing5,000 rupees every month in this combination,meaning 60% in Nifty 50,25% in midcap,15% in smallcap,then after 10 years,you will have nearly18.5 lakh rupees.You will have 18.5 lakhs,which is not a small amount.You started fromjust 5,000 rupees.But this 18.5 lakhswill also have a value, because inflation is also there.Every year, due to inflation, the price of everything increases.So, the value ofyour money decreases. So, in today's world,if we try to find the value ofthe 18.5 lakh after 10 years,it would be nearly10.25 lakh rupees.It means right now,you would have avalue of 10.25 lakhs to do whatever you can at today's price. This is how you read it.Now, have a look at how after every 5-year interval, how much it increases.After 15 years,these 18 lakhs willbecome 50 lakh rupees, 50 lakh rupees,and that will mean 21 lakh rupees as per today's price. After 20 years,1 crore 23 lakh rupees,and its value will be nearly40 lakh at today's price.After 25 years,2 crore 85 lakh rupees,and its value will be nearly 65 lakh rupees, so on and so forth.After 40 years,no idea whether it will bethere after 40 years or not,but if it's stays for 40 years, then this mere 5,000 rupees,increasing at 10% every year,will give you 32 crore rupees,which will be3 crore rupees at today's price.A lot of people will ask,âAfter 40 years,5,000 rupees, increasing at 10%, how much will it be?â I will give you that number. Let's look. After 40 years, every month,1 crore;Sorry, not 1 crore, 1,23,000 rupees.You will be investing1,23,000 in Nifty 50,nearly 50,000 rupees in midcap,and nearly 31,000 rupeesin smallcap.It's not a big amount, my friend. A total of nearly 2 lakh rupeeswill be your investing amount after 40 years. It is not likesome magic has happened. You are investing in crores.That's why you're earning crores. No.It is just the power ofyou enjoying thesereturns for 40 years.Now, these returnswill also fluctuate.That's perfectly fine,but it is important to understandthat this is not anexcuse, my friend. âMy salary is 25,000 a monthand I can investonly 5,000 rupees.What difference will it make? So, it's better not to do it.â It's wrong.It's the wrong approach.Now, let's playaround this number. Let's say your income is 15,000 rupees,and you can investonly 3,000 rupees.We will invest it inthe same location, and your goal is, âWhen will I get 1 crore rupees? Not even at today's price,just 1 crore in the bank account.âAnd somewherewithin 20-25 years,you will see 1 crorein your bank account.If you want 1 croreat today's price,then after investingfor 30-35 years, you will get 1 crore rupees, 1 crore rupees at today's price in your bank account,and it's bank value,meaning the actualamount in the bankwould be nearly 5 crore rupees,and its value will be1 crore at today's price.Now, ifwe earn 50,000 rupees.Let's consider the same 20%.So, we will invest 10,000 rupees. So, as you can see,within 15 years,within just 15 years,you will have 1 crorerupees in the bank,and if you want 1crore at today's price, then within 20-25 years,you will have 1 crore rupees.This is the power of investing, but it is important to understandthat this mix isextremely important.Now, recently I saw areally interesting chart. Aditya Kondawarcreates amazing financecontent on Twitter,and he has recentlyreleased a bookon Rajesh Jhunjhunwalaâslife story,on his life history.Please read it. It's not a promotion,but I know him.The book was really good. So, that's whyI am sharing it.He shared a really interestingchart of FundsIndia,which tells us that your SIP amount, how much is it per month,and you are increasing it at 10%,and how much money willyou have in the bank,it is shown in the chart.10 lakhs, 20 lakhs,30 lakhs, 50 lakhs, whatever, till 10 crores,and then it tells thatif you increase thisamount at 12% every year,then how long will it takeyou to earn that amount.For example, it saysthat if you invest 30,000 a month,and you earn a 12%rate of return,within 10 years, you will earn 1 crore rupees. Let's check it becausewhether it's right or not.So, let's assume we areearning 30,000 a month.We are investing 100% of it because I just want to show it.We are investing in Nifty 50because it is the option.So, we won't investanywhere else,and now have a look.After 10 years, it tells us,after 10 years,you will have 1 crorerupees in the bank,1 crore 22,000 to be precise, and its value at today's pricewould be 56 lakh rupees.
