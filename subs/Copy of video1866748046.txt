Okay.I am recording at my endvideo, audio, all set.Are you as well?I'll just double check my video.Perfect.Brilliant, it's working.Audio also on?Audio on.Awesome, perfect! Let's get started.Hey Akshat, thank you so muchfor joining me today.It's always a pleasure to have youand I'm really excitedfor today's conversationbecause this conversation is going to bedifferent than the usual.I hope you're doing well.Thank you. Everything well.How are things at your end?Wonderful, man!Firstly, a big congratulationson your 1 million.Very well deserved.There are very few people for whomI am happy as I am for youbecause I know the amount of effortthat you put inand the high quality of contentthat you share.So very well-deserved.And 10 million is not far away now.Absolutely! Thank you so much.And for people who do not know,so Ankur messaged me,and telling me about some strategiesthat I can use to growbecause I don't studymy YouTube algorithm.But Ankur studies itvery patiently like a student, right.So it was so nice of him to sharehis insights with meand helping other creators like meto grow as well.We all look up to Ankurfrom growth perspective,the type of cross-platform growththat Ankur has had,I think no one in India would have hadsuch an impressive growth.So nice that he's sayingsuch nice things about me.It's just like a fan moment for me, right.Absolutely well-deserved, man!I don't think it's a zero-sum-game at all,it's a positive-sum-game,so the more we help each other,the better it would be.But thank you and congratulations again!Thank you!Akshat, I wanted to talk about moneybut in a very different way.Because we mostly actively speakabout investingand about how to grow your moneyand how to be wise about it.But I wanted to talk about yourrealtionship with moneyand that's where the conversation is.So I want to start with my first questionthat growing up,how was your relationship with money?Like did you grow with a lot of moneyor was it like this struggling familywhere ends were hard to meet?How was it for you?So my parents,I would say typical middle-class,like my mom workedwith Punjab National Bankand she worked as a cashierat Punjab National Bank,so it was a governmnet job, right.My dad retired as a manager,as a senior branch managerat United India Insurance Company.So again, typical thing.My grandfather was a doctor,so he was a homeopathy doctor,so this was it.From childhood I have been taught that,first and foremost, respect hard work,respect money.Because my parents,there are two reasons for that,one is my mom for example,like a lot of typical Indian moms,she woke up in the morning,she used to make my tiffin,send me to school,then she used to go to the office.Then she used to come back,sometimes she got an opportunityto come back for lunchsince the bank was close by.So then sometimes she used to cook,come back, right.I remember when I was growing up,KBC had just started, like seson 1, right,and it was really blown up at that time.A serial like KBC, and there werewere not many shows at that time.So my mom had given mean incentive structure at that timethat everytime I get a question askedon KBC right,she will give me â¹1.And I used to study for it extensively.So I was taught money makingfrom childhood, in a way thatyou have to work hard to earn money,so I used to read books too,I started enjoying gaining knowledge.It became like a gamified versionfor me to earn money.And the other aspect wasthat I used to play cricket,as I told you in our last conversation,so you had to work really really hard.When I was 13-14 years old,I got like my first paycheckfor playing cricketand you feel like elatedwhen you get something.It's not about the quantum of moneythat you're making,it's just that you made money as a kid.So that kind of sparked interestto not necessarily make money,but at least value it more.So whenever I had to spend it,I understood the value of that money,like even I have got â¹500,still it's enough, from that perspective.That's so true!It was a typical middle-classsort of a thing.There was no struggle as such.My parents spent whateverthey could on me from that angle.So I would say that I hada very nice upbringing from that angle.I would say not struggling for money,but also not lavish like spend moneyon whatever I would want.Was it something asit's in most Indian families,how much ever money you may have,but don't spend moneyon this particular thing?Were you stopped from spendingmoney on something?Actually, I was frugal spendersince childhood, right.I remember, I'm sure that you wouldalso be able to relate with thisthat till class 12thwe did not have cell phones.If we had to call a friend,we had to use the landline.We must be sounding very old tothe people who are listening to this.I'll still complete the story.So, we had landline at that time,and the calls were really expensive,I think one local call used to cost â¹2.So I remember asking my parentsif I wanted to call a friend of mine,I used to take permission from my parentsthat 'Can I call?'.I was in 6th-7th class,then they used to give it,and then I used to call my friend up.And sometimes I also had the option thatride the cycle for 2 km.vis-a-vis call them,so majority of times,I used to prefer to ride the cycle,that is better rather than spending â¹2.That's awesome!That doesn't answer the question,but I just wanted to share that answer.No, that's such a wonderful!As you were speaking,I recalled a story that,I don't know if you ever had that.Video games were very fascinatingbut we never had that kind of money,at least we didn't,that we could have our own video game.So there were some shopswhere you could publicallyplay video games,like Mario, Contra, and all that,and they used to charge â¹1for playing the game,till the time either your game gets over,or you win it.And it used to cost â¹1for inflating the cycle.So it usually happenedthat I took â¹1 from mom,and told her that I am gettingthe cycle inflated,I used to inflate it myself,and then play that video game for â¹1,because I was so fascinated by that,so I remembered,I don't know how I remembered,so like you were saying thatinstead of making a phone callyou used to ride the cycle,it just brought back memories.Wonderful!Which city did you grow in?I grew up predominantly in Gwalior,so that's where my parents still live,and that's where I completedmost of my schooling.Nice!I was about to ask this question,I had it in my list.You used to play cricket,so unlike a lot of kids in the country,you started actuallyearning on your own very early,besides pocket money,and whatever you got onbirthdays and festivities.What did you do with that money?I used to give it to my parents,like even when relatives used to give,and this is a very typical tradition.I think this tradition isall over India thatwhen relatives come to your house,they give you â¹100-500, whatever,I didn't know what to do with it,so I used to give all the moneyto my parents.I never got any pocket money or anything,but it wasn't like if I askfor something from my parents,and give them a proper rationalthat why do I need it,they used to give me everything.I remeber there was a video gamein which we were to kill ducks,I'm forgetting the name of that.It was like a very funnysort of a video game,because you were required to killthem externally with a gun,a plastic gun and not a real gun,and the duck used to dieon the computer screen.My mom was like,she was not very warm to that idea,but then she bought me thatbecause I was after her life,and she got addicted to playing that,so that's very funny.After that, whatever I needed,she used to agree becasue typicallyshe thought I take right decisions,and at least enjoysbecause of that decison,so I used to somehow get thingsright, from that angle.That's awesome!And you never had the habit ofputting it in a piggy bank,then doing something with it later,like buy something from it, never!You just gave it to your parents,and whenever you would want something,they will surely give it.Actually, I didn't have many needswhile growing up, in the sensethat I used to be busy the whole time.I used to play cricketso that took 5-6 hours,then school work,so I didn't have time tobuy expensive things,or something of that sort.So yeah, I don't think I hadto do anything like that.And I was earning myself very early,I used to earn in collegeas well for teaching GMAT, etc.If I had to buy a bike,I purchased it through that,I took my parents' money also,but it wasn't likethat I had to save a lot,and then only buy it,because I started earning way early.Yeah, that leads me to the next question.What was your first proud purchasewith your own money,majority of it with your money?Which was my first proud purchase?I think I got a website built,I had to hire a developer for it.I don't remeber how much I paid for that,I think I paid around â¹10,000.We have to buy the domain namefor that, right, and all that stuff,so the expense was around â¹25K-30K,which was for my GMAT tutoring website,so I would say that wasmy first proud purchase,if we can call it a purchase.That is!When was this?So, this was in the 3rd year,I would say roughly.Very early in life.Fantastic, man!And then I bought a bike, CBZ,I don't know if it's prevalent.Oh, fancy!I don't even know, but when it came out,it was very popular!Yeah!So that was the bike that I had.My parents sold it without telling me.I went to Delhi and got busy working.I don't even know where is it now.But this was like an interesting thing,these 2 things.Wow, awesome!And when you were growing up Akshat,did you ever have like a number in mind,that this is how rich I want to be?Genuinely no!If you will ask me even right nowI don't have a number in mind.I am like one of those personswho is very unstructured, right, in life.I look very structured, but I'm not.I live day-to-day.I take things on the fly, right?A lot of things.I do a lot of things on the fly.I started my YouTube channel alsoon the fly,without thinking too muchabout the algorithm,because I genuinely don't thinkthat long-term plans work out.You should know the general directionof where you are going.As long as you have the right habits,you are hard working,and I don't bother too muchabout the micro details.You must have seen my setup,it's pretty basic.I still use iPhone, right,all the basic stuff.So I don't bother too much about micros,I just have a general idea about macros,that net-net,you should be doing fine, right.It works very well for you.This is something which isextremely self-aware,because so many people try to becomesomebody else thinking thatit's important,but I love the clarity in your headthat this is my strength,this is what works for meand I will play it to the core.Wonderful, very nice!At what point in time Akshat,did you actively startthinking of investing?Actually, my mom used to invest,she used to invest in FDs.Actually, my grandfather used to invest.He used to buy stocks, literally.In those times, you couldn't log on toZerodha or the internet to get knowledge.Only the news used to be the access,that's where you got to knowthe rates of shares.And my grandfather usedto speak with a trader,you couldn't even buy it directly,so you had to call up a trader,you had to book your stock through them,and then purchase it.I used to watch that very early.I used to play chess a lotwith my grandfather.So I was very interestedin playing chess rightfrom a very young age,and he used to tell me a lot of things,but I was not very interestedin investing at that point in time.But yeah, so that habit cameto my mom also,because my mom didn't invest activelyin the stock marketbut she used to still explorelike mutual funds, or FDs.So I think that since the timeI started making money,trade a little bit of money,which was in college itself,so I started investingfrom that point in time only.In the beginning, I startedinvesting actively in mutual funds,as I have often said on my YouTube,that initially I started investingin mutual funds.Then I myself realizedthat there's not much benefitin investing for 2-3 years only.If we give a little commission,we can see that the commission is littlebut its impact is a lotin the long term,so I witnessed some problems.Then I refined my investing style andover time it has been growing.Nice!And was there a point when you feltthat you will have to activelylearn about all this?Like I know that you actively swing trade.It seems you would also trade inoptions, futures or derivativesin general.So that requires a fair bit of expertise.An amateur can't do it.At least I would not advise anybodyto do that without the expertise.So you learned this on your ownbecause you had an inclination,or were you kind of disappointedwith the returns of mutual funds?What difference would 13-15% make?I was always interested in studying,so I have cleared CFA as welltill level 2. I didn't do level 3,because I became a management consultant.People said,'There is no point in doing CFA,you don't want to go into finance.'So I didn't complete CFA.Maybe I'll complete it someday,I don't know.It's just that I know the basics,it's not as if I didn't know about it.So that's one, I was quite interestedin teaching financeso that was one part of it.Second thing is I don't trade actively.I do just a few trades,swing trades mostly.I do futures and options also,but I don't recommend that,I don't even talk aboutfutures and options on my channel,because that's somethingthrough which you can be bankrupt, right.So that's not somethingthat I would advocate.As I talk about crypto,I always say do it ina diversified manner,invest only that much moneythat you can risk, that is still ok.But if you consider thingslike leverage-based positions,like if you take a loanand invest in the stock marketfor a long term,then also it's a problem,because that is leverage.Leverage is debt,because you built your game on debt money.So that is problematic.You should not do that according to me,and there are so many complexitiesin futures and options thatit could not be advisable.Unless I explain it in an elaborate way,I'll not even talk about it on my channel.But yes, you are absolutely right,you learn gradually.So for example, I would saystart studying economics.You will get a lot of awareness.Then think about like long term investing,then think about positional trading,then think about other futures and optionsand bunch of other thingsthat are involved in finance.Awesome!I want to talk about moments in your lifestarting with a time in your lifewhich was very hardwhen it comes to money,either family wise or personally.Yes and no.This will be an oxymoronic story,so that's the word of the day today,as I usually teachthe word of the day today.I know!It's oxymoron for today.So you can let us know in the comments.What does oxymoron means?It will be oxymoronicbecause at that time I was in Singaporeand I was a student at NCR,and at that time we had  an apartment,so the cost of living in Singaporeis really high.I got scholarship for NCR,so that's how it was possible.But living in Singaporeis really expensive.For example, when I lived thereas a student,I used to live witha Singaporean family,they used to sublet a room to me.And it was HDB.You get houses throughthe Housing Development Board,which are like government houses,so they cost less, right.So suddenly, my landlord increasedthe rent, without any notice,so I had to leave it.So, I slept in NCR for 2-3 days.I don't know if it was illegal or legal.I stayed on a recliner chair for 3-4 days,infact, for a week on that recliner chair.It's not really money problem,but I just did not have moneyto sort of move anywhere else.So that was like a little bit ofa phase there.But I know that people have it1000 times harder than me,so I cannot complain about it.But since you asked me a question,I'm just exchanging, you know.No, absolutely.I sort of struggled a little bit.And another one is,when I worked in Delhifor almost a year, year and a half.My salary was really low, right,I was earning maybe like â¹10K-15K,because I was working with the government,and in those times, as a consultant,you did not make a lot of money,so my expenses were more.And chickpeas curry with breadis very common in Delhi, I still eat.One plate is for â¹25-30 these days,that time it used to be for â¹10-15so I ate for like six months,not a very healthy habit,but I had no option, so I ate that.That was that.Wow, that's awesome!I can relate to that.I can relate a lot to that.And any horrible investment mistakethat you've made and you're like,what was I thinking?There were manybut I did it with an understandingof risk-reward,so there are a lot of such investments,usually, they are bound to be.For example, if you studyany big investor's portfolio,I am talking about a portfolio,I am not talking about individual stocks.You can look at the portfoliosof Vijay Giria, Kamdev Agarwal,there is a period of 3-4 yearsin everybody's portfolio,when their entire portfoliodrops down from 100 crores to 50 crores.I am not talking about a stock,I am talking about an entire portfolio,so everybody has those phases in life,I don't think there's anythingto be afraid of.But there are a lot of investments,that are still there today,for example, a few stocksin which I am invested,there is a stock calledJeevan Small Finance,by the way, it's not a recommendation,so I have around 50% loss.There are a few good stocks,for example, HDFC in whichthere is about 30-40% loss.All these things keep happening,so it's very hard to say.But something in whichI lost conviction and sold it.I can't think of anything immediately,but yes, there are still a lot ofnotional loss making thingsin my portfolioand they are always there.It's not as if...That's a part of invest.That's how I would work.Makes sense, makes a lot of sense.I'm curious to know Akshat,that your persona where you arenow a content creator,you are an online educator,you also mentor a lot of people,actively invest.Let me ask this question differently.Is this by designthat you have multiple income streamsor is it something that just happenedbecause of what you are doingand you didn't plan for it?It's a good question.I've never evenfully reflected on that, right.But I'll tell you the stats,I will give you an indirect answer.Yesterday I was analyzinga few of the articles,and the stats were thatif you considerthe total inflation of Indiafrom 2012-2022,so the total price increase that hashappened is from â¹1,000 to â¹1,600.So the things you got for â¹1,000 in 2012,are now for â¹1,600,so that's what the studies tell us.The flip aspect of it is,if you see the GDP per capita incomeof India, that has risenonly by 30% in the last 10 years,approximately last 10 years.So which indicates that,it's not that people feelthat they are poorbecause there's inflation,it's because people feel poorbecause the income has not risenat a faster rate.There is a huge difference betweenthese two philosophiesbecause you speak with almost anyone,the answer that you mostly get is,'There's inflation.'No!It is just thatthe rate of wealth increasehas slowed down massivelyover the last one decadeand which is a huge problem, right.So why I'm telling you the story isbecause hopefully,you'll remember this storyand would try to think about the fact,that nowadays that's the only wayto sort of build wealth.That's probably my hypothesis.I can be off, but yes,probably the only wayto build wealth is,truly build wealth is tomanifold your income streams,so by design, you should do it.Probably, I didn't do it by design,they happened becauseI kep doing various things.But after listening to this,at least try that you havemultiple income streams.Absolutely, so true!And especially if you're young,you have that risk taking abilitybecause responsibilities are lesser,hopefully, your expenditure is lesserand you can diversify a lot morearound the exploration,that what are the new thingsthat you can do,which over a period of 5-10 years,if not earlier,start generating an income stream whichwill only add to your overall.Because it's one thing to beat inflation,and to grow your income,is just another ball game.and most people unfortunately,center themselves on cost.Another example, I was readinga wonderful thread on Twitterwhere there was somebodywho was saying that VCs,especially when they gothrough market correction,how they get it wrong?Because a lot of boards,I have had the luxury of sittingon multiple boards,and I also ran startups,so I know that firsthand,whenever there is a talkof market correction,everybody starts centering on cost,'Lower the cost!'And that becomes a conversation across.And there was a statisticthat was shown thateven during good times,65% of all conversationsof board meetings are around cost,and only 35% are around income growth,which is so tragicbecause that should bethe absolute opposite.If you talk about your income growth,which is frankly infinite,because you can growto whatever extent you want,that will be far far far more fruitful,because you will have to bear expensesat some or the other point,and you can't run away from that.How much can you reduce,but income, you can grow infinitely.So thanks for stressing on that point.Absolutely!And let me tell youanother important stat here.For example, now there istriple taxation problem in India.Triple taxation problem simply meanslike there's dividend distribution tax,so that is triple tax.So one salary is taxed thrice.Twice through the corporatesand once when it comes in your account.So taxation is the ultimate cost, right,in a way, and if tax is increased,then no matter how much youcut down expenses,you can't really help it, right.That is beyond your control.The only thing that you can controlis increasing your revenue.Absolutely, well put, man!If you don't mind sharing,of all the things that you do,what makes you the most money today?Of all the things that I do?I would say that running my businesseswould make the most money for me.Go ahead.Like I'm in a study abroad space,I do courses also right now,I run like a subscription modelup until very recently,like a management consulting firm, right.So different, different businesses,so that's where my major income is from.So yeah, that's what I would say.Nice!And I saw that you are alwayson top of this,like you have already launcheda management consulting course.On 1 million, I saw the announcementthat you'd launch somethingfor kids which is sucha brilliant initiative.Are you always working on these ideasor people keep suggesting it?How does that mind work of yours?I work from the point of viewthat what can I do properly.It's not about making more money.It's about, for example,management consulting course.So I have already done it really well.For example, one of the companies thatI run, it's called as Cases Over Poppy.There we have physical presenceon universities like UC Berkeley,University of Pennsylvania,University of Toronto,which is an Indian companywhich grew to become like one ofthe largest platformson management consulting.So that gave me a background tolaunch a course on management consulting.So that was the reason why I did it.Like, the kids storytelling thing.So I look at my son, right,he's growing up, right.So he loves watching thingslike CocoMelon and whatnot.I'm not sure if your kids watch thator not.I love CocoMelon, totally!Brilliant.So that is like the most popularsort of kids' show.And he really enjoyed CocoMelontill the age of 1.5 years.But now he started gravitatingtowards story-based things.Like, there is a story calledas Buster the Bus.So he loves to listen to those stories.That's how I thought that we can dosomething like this as well.So it's mostly through observation.Often people also give me ideas.Sometimes, because of the environmentI'm in,I get to explore things myself,so then I sort of pick it up from there.Fantastic! Brilliant, man!If inspiration is all around you,then you're exactly where you need to be.So I love that!Would you say Akshat, that you'vereached the point offinancial independence?I would say yes.I think even if it's not,the imporatnt caveat thatI would like give here is,it's not because of the moneythat I'm making or the moneythat I'm getting in the past,even before YouTube.It's because my expenses are not too much.So for example, if my expensesare not too much,and if I can sustain that lifestylefor a substantial period of time.Hello?No problem.I thought the light went out.There's a lot of electricity problem herebecause of heat,even the wires are burning up, literally.This is the problem in small cities.Like in my AC,the wire literally burnt off.Wow!Electricity in small cities,especially in Madhya Pradeshis a little bit off.It is off!So you were saying, reduce the expenses.Yes.So let me start from the beginning.So the imporatnt caveat thatI would like give here is,it's not because of the moneythat I'm making or the moneythat I made in the past,that's why I have financial freedomor financial independence.It's just that my expensesare very limited.So if I get to a pointwhere my expenses are very lessin respect to the income,then you have reached a stageof financial freedom.But your natural question would be,then what you will do with the moneyand what gives you motivation to work?Because this is something thatI keep on getting all the time.So yeah, you don't work for money,I mean, money becomesan outcome of things that you are doing.You don't necessarily do itfor money money per se.Of course, you would want to becompensated for the effortthat you are putting in.But the kick you getby doing somethings, right?For example, if I'm getting into a space,let's say the children's story booksor the idea of finance for kids,So I'm executing that,and honestly, there's no moey in that.But I'm just doing itbecause it's fun for me to do itand maybe I'll be able to monetize it.I'll use my brain,and maybe one day I'll be ableto monetize it, something like that.But that's not the goalwith which I'm startingthat entire ambition.And I will anyway,distribute it for free, that entire, yeah.That's brilliant, man!I recalled a conceptwhich I'm sure you're also aware of.In startups, there is thisHoly grail concept ofInfinite Runway.And the simple logic ofInfinite Runway isif you are a profitable company,then you will never have to raise funding.And ironically, that is whenmost money will chase you,because most money wants to beinvesting itself in profitable,high-growth companies.So if you reduce your expenses,and make your life's P&L statementas positive, then suddenlyany money that comes inis free, over and above what you needed.And surprisingly, that opens upso many opportunities for youto make money that you perhapsdid not even know of,when you were constantlyrunning in debt,or constantly trying to survive.So Ankur, since you are froma startup background,you have worked,and you have seen boththe sides of the equation, right,running a funded startupand constantly being in a race,or somewhat being in a raceof raising money, vis-a-vis,bootstrapping your companies.So these days, a lot of kids,I mean college students, etc.,they are more gravitatedtowards raising money.So what would be your messageto them from that angle?Akshat, the reality is,no matter how much you tell them,for no fault of theirs,they will continue gravitating it,because that looks sexierand far more glamorous.And that was my reason tooto run a funded startup,because someone else is giving you money,you are talking in crores,you're getting press coverage,you're getting great talent,you have a fancy office,all of that looks really good.It's the equivalent of you making moneyin crypto in 3 years,when people haven't made it in 30 years.So it looks really awesomefrom the outside.But when you get in,you realize the dynamics of how it works,which may not always be pegged for you,because as a founder,the most imporatnt thing to realize isthat your 100% allocationis on one startup, which is yours.But VC has thousands of such allocations,so for no fault of theirs also,they are not looking at youas the only way of their success.You are one of the many reasonswhy they will succeed.But for you, you are the founder,your startup successis the only success that matters.So, that makes the equation somewhatimbalanced in my opinion.But this is like Matrix, Akshat,where no one can be toldwhat the Matrix is.You have to experience it yourselfto believe it.So I give this suggestion to people,but I frankly, don't expect them to listenbecause even I didn't listenwhen somebody was telling methe same thing.I tell them,'Do it, but learn from it,because you learn from your mistakes.If you make a mistake,and don't learn from it,and make the same mistake again,then that's a far bigger mistake.'And I think people are wiser through that.I love your frugality thing.So I'm very curious.What is the most expensive thing you own?What is the most expensive thingthat I own?Okay, so I think my i20would be the one which is expensive,which I own, right, so that would be one.It was for â¹6-6.5 lakhs,that would be one.Akshat, you are breaking people's hearts!They will say,'You are teaching to make crores,what will we do with it?'No actually, let me setthe context here, right.Like for example,last month I was in Goa,so I rented a car,and it was for â¹1,200-1,500 per day.It's not as if I'm not spendingmoney on cars, but in Goa,if you're living in South Goafor a little bit,then you need a car, right?And I cannot pick my car from Delhi,and transport it to Goa.And if I'm not staying in Delhifor more than like 4-5 months,if I'm traveling,like I'm going to Manali on the 22nd,and I'll be staying there,and all that stuff,so I need that freedom,so I'm not tied to assets.So that is one key aspect,I don't own too manyexpensive things.If I buy a houseor have many materialistic possessions,that's when it becomes a problem.But yes, if you ask me that,'Where do you want to spend?'So that would be interesting.I think at some stageI would want to own a house,which would have a swimming pool.That is somethingthat I've always wantedbecause it improves health,and I love swimmingand I don't like going to public poolsand all that stuff.So that is something that I see utility,but that will come with a cost,so I'll probably make that call onceI'm at a certain stage in life, right.So that would be one.Second thing would be my laptop.I think it is for around 75-90,no, now it's for â¹1 lakh,it's a Macbook Pro Air, something.Third would be this mic.I think this mic is for â¹20K-25K,so I think these 3-4 things probably.Except for your car,which is a very legit purchase,everything else are your assets,they are not really purchses,because your mic and your laptophave paid for themselvesmultiple times over already.These are what I use to shoot with, right.Exactly!Absolutely!And I have to clarify something.I own these Airpods,I said I will not own Airpods,so somebody has giftem them,so that is the reason why I have it.I have not purchased these.I love how people keep nudging you with,'You said this,and howcome this has happened?!'And then you go about clarifyingbecause that shows the honestyin your approach,which I find very endearing.Thank you for that.You have answered myother question as well,what is this that you would want to do?So the property dealersof Delhi's farmhouseswill start calling you,because that's where you can geta house with swimming pool.No, I won't buy in Delhi.I don't think it would be possibleto have a swimming pool in Delhi,and that would be like super expensive.The prices are very high in Delhi.Then prepare to move to Goa.Exactly!Alright, before we close Akshat,I have a bunch of 5 rapid fire questions.You will answer whatever comesto your mind instantly.That's how we will do.Okay, number one,pick between money and power.I'll pick power.Explanantion?Yes, go ahead please,that would be nice.I think because money hasa finite useand power has an infinite use.For example, if you considerany major politician,it doesn't meanI am joining politics.You may think I'm givingan interview wearing a Kurta,so we'll get comments.It's nothing like that.I have no interest.There is a lot of stress too in it,so that is the overarching viewpoint.But I genuinely feel that power is power!Power cannot be compared with money,because if you think about itfrom a structural point of view,I think politics control economics.Economics controls finance.Finance controls money.So we are way down in the chain, right.So that's how I would say.Correct, makes sense!Pick between speed and perfection.I would say there should be a balance,but if I have to pick one,then I think speed, right.Because I'll pick speed.It looks like it.Your temperament is alsosomewhat who is like,let's ship it out,let's get that feedback.Let's hear what people have to say.So I like that approach.Very entrepreneurial approach.So I can relate to that a lot.Pick between 100 crores today,or going back to when you were 20,knowing what you know today.Going back to my 20and knowing what I would.In fact, even if you change this equation,make it 1,000 crores,I would still go back to my 20.That's a very wise way of saying it.I love that!So many people would say,'Give us 100 crores,we are more than happy.'Believe in yourself.Awesome!Pick between these two things,buying a Tesla caror going on a space flighton a SpaceX rocket.Spacex.It's quite simple,because it's the experience.What will I do with a Tesla car?!I'll still get stuck inDelhi traffic or something, right.So, there's no benefit.And I said a very good line,'If you own a Ferrari in India,or a Tesla, or any other fancy car,people even put scratches in Delhi.'I am not kidding!Exactly!That's a reality! I am stating this.Okay.Final question.What do you think will beyour biggest purchase in your life?So, the house with a swimming pool.It's not right now,I knew this for the past 10-15 years,that I'll buy a house witha swimming pool one day,whenver I feel like settling downfrom that angle.Like, enough of traveling,so just settle down.So, I might pick a housewith a private swimming pool.Nice!Is there a possibilityyou'll settle outside of Indiaif you get the opportunity?I travel a lot outside India.But I don't think I will settleoutside India, because there area lot of conveniences in India, whichcan be an entirely different episode.So I don't thinkI'll settle outside India per se.But who knows?I don't make like long-term plans.Exactly.On that note, with no long-term plans.Thank you so much, Akshat.It's always a joy speaking to you.May you continue to grow, flourish,help others in that journey.I will remain an absolute admirerfrom a distance.And thank you for spending timewith us today.Thank you Aknur,it's a pleasure, thank you.Awesome.Thank you.
