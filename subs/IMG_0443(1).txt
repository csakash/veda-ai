I still remember 3 small thingsthat my parents used to do to save money,because we never had any money in life.We all loved Maggi,so once or twice a month,we used to buy Maggi,and make four small portionsof that one packet,which all four of us used to eatvery happily.My sister and I are 6 years apart,so our school uniform was very similar,so as soon as my uniform was finished,it used to go to my sister,because there was no money to buya new uniform.And whenever we wanted entertainment,we used to go to India Gate.The four of us were on our scooter,carrying vegetable rice and curd.We used to eat the same food,and finished the evening witha â¹5 ice candy fromKwality or Mother Dairy,and that's it, the day was made.Do you remember anythingfrom your childhood?
