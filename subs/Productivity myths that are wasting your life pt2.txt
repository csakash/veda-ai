Myth number 9:People who plan are very inflexiblein life,their life is very tight,very regimented, just like a soldier,this plan and that plan, etc.,but that is actually not true.Go back to the thing that I started with.Our mind is very fickle,our mind is very restless,our mind is always bouncing,what am I going to do next?We had to do this, we had to do that,oh, I forgot, I had to call.So if you make a plan, and keepingthat plan in mind,you have a conversation with your mind,then your mind settles down.If you tell your mind,I have to do these 3 things today,I have to talk to these 3 people today,I have to finish these 5 things today,I have to accomplish this thing this week.Then your mind knows thatthere is a plan and a method tohow we will get there,and because of that,it doesn't get distracted sincenow it has a direction,and I just have to follow that direction,and that helps the mind.So plan yourself as much as possible.Create a schedule, an approach,and a direction for yourselfas much as possible towardswhat you want to achieve and by when,and that will help your mind bea lot more productive.Myth number 10:People with routinesare very boring in life.I often hear this,Ankur Warikoo,you have a very old-school routine.Wake up at a certain time,then meditate, then read,then get the children ready,then play tennis, then to the gym,then get ready, and have breakfast.Where is the fun in life, my friend?Have food by 6:30, go to sleep by 9,you have a dry life!What people don't recognize is routinedoesn't mean that you keepdoing things cut to cut.Routine means you have discipline in life.You are creating a recurrence,a frequency,through which you are tryingto tell your mind again,dude, you need to do this every day,every week, every month, every year!Because now it's your routine,and that helps the mind get ready for it.And routine also doesn't mean thateverything is so rigid thatyou can't change it.A routine could also mean thatyou create a flexible time routinefor yourself.For example, till 9:30, I followa morning routine where I do everythingI want to do but it is very strict.After 9:30, when I get to work,my routine is around workbut it is very flexible.I might read something, talk to someone,think of something, or plan something,and what I do is not set,but the hours that I do it inis the routine.So my routine is actually to be free,to be open,and that gives great settlementto the mindwhen it comes to your productivity levels.So if you can create a routine,sleeping at the same time,waking up at the same time,eating, exercising,stepping out and feeling the sun,soaking the sunshine,eating right, thinking right,and following the right people,then it will only help your minddeclutter itselfand be a lot more productive.And finally, the last mythbut the most important myth.All of us feel that being busyis equal to being productive.If I am busy in life then I'm productive.So we indulge in random work,we actually create work.We sit in the office for hours,spend hours on random work,indulge in random discussions,and we think that if we are busy,we are in meetings,we are talking to people,we are writing emails,we are on the phone,we are reading something,then that is being productive,but it is not.Being productive meansthat in the least time,you create the most impact.Productivity doesn't mean thatyou work for 24 hours.Productivity means that in those 24 hours,how much you sleep,how much time do you spend on yourself,and in the least of timeyou achieve thingsthat the world wants from you.That is being productive!Productivity means thatyou have time for yourself.Productivity means thatyou have time to do the thingsthat you should be doing in life.Productivity means that peopleare constantly surprisedthat in how less time,how much high-quality output you produce,that is not equal to being busy.So please, don't make being busyin life an objective.Being productive should be the objective.I hope through these 11 myths,in 2023, you will be able to conqueryour productivity challenges,and become a productivity ninja this year.I hope this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
