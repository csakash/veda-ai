Number 1:Money really can buy happiness.Many people speak like this,they say falsely thatmoney cannot buy happiness,they are lying!Have you ever seen any rich personexchanging with a poor person?No, right!But every poor person is readyto exchange with a rich person.Why?Because money gives convenience,money removes many everyday difficulties.It does not mean that youstart running after money,but to think that money will nevergive you happiness,you will never get comfort,you will never get peace, that's a lie.You can get everything that is necessaryfor you in your life with money,so don't run after money,but also don't run away from moneybecause it can bring happiness.Shocking fact number 1!Number 2:It is often more profitableto rent things as against buying things.If you ever do the mathon excel,then you will surely come to knowthat renting things is more beneficial,and this is the nature of money.Why?Because we often forget onevery important element of money,and its name is opportunity cost.Suppose you want to buy a house,and to buy a house you have to makea down payment.Suppose you are buying a houseworth 1 crore,then you will have to makea down payment of â¹20-25 lakhs,then you will have to takea loan of â¹75 lakhs,and you do not get a loanfor the registration of the house,so you will have to makea down payment for that too,so broadly â¹30-35 lakhs will beyour down payment,you will give it together.But if you rent a house,then you will give a maximumof â¹30-35 K per month for a houseworth 1 crore.This means if you still havethat â¹30-35 lakhs,then by giving that â¹30-35 K per month,you can invest this â¹30-35 lakhs,and if you invest in the right way,then you will generate a return from it.When you don't do this,it becomes an opportunity cost.I have rented almost everythingexcept my house.Our car is on rent.I am very fond of photography,so whenever we go on wildlife travel,the camera lenses are very expensive,so we rent those lenses,they are very cheap,because how much will I use that lens?Maximum 5-6 days in a year,why should I buy a lensworth â¹4 lakhs for that?But if I rent the same lensworth â¹4 lakhs,then I pay a maximum â¹10-15K rentfor those 4-5 days,and I can live like thatfor the rest of my life.I remember earlierI was very fond of buying houses,and I bought so many of them,and burnt so much money on them.Now, whenever we go on vacation,because we have kids,we're a family of 4,we don't stay in hotels,we stay in Airbnb,and AirBnBs are so brilliant, right?Because you can stay in the best houses,whether we are going to Goa,or going anywhere International.We just went to Dubai,so we stayed there ona very nice 23rd flooroverlooking Dubai Marina,and that house is worth â¹4 crores.In a house worth â¹4 crores,even if we want,we can stay for no more than10-15 days a month,but when we stay there,we are ready to pay good money for it,and renting it out is far more efficientuse of your moneythan buying that entire property.So please before buying any big thing,do the math,whether it will be more beneficialto rent it or to buy it.Do this math first by keepingyour emotions at bay becauseyour emotions will surely come back.Number 3:We deal with our money very carefullywhen we do not know how thatmoney can be earned back.The person who knows how to earn money,never see their money as risk-averse,they always try to amplify it.They make the right investments,take risks,understand all the profiles of thatrisk very well,know where their money can sinkand where it can grow,and through this risk profile,they deploy their money .But the person who doesn't knowhow this money can be earned again,the person who doesn't knowhow this money came,and because of it can goand never come back,that person will keep that moneyclose to their chest forever,that money will never be used properly,and that is such a shocking,saddening aspect about money,and I wish it never happens to you.Number 4:I speak a lot about investments,but the best use of money foran investment is in yourself.You should invest in your learning.The sponsors of this video is Udemywhich is a great platform,I really like their courses.Whether I want to learn aboutfinancial investment,or digital marketing,or I have to learn how YouTubeor Facebook work,if I have to learn graphic designingor UX/UI,I haven't ever learned to codebut if I ever want to learn it,I will learn it from Udemy,because the best instructors,the best price, a great outlayof all possible coursesthat you would want, and what more,you have a 30-day refund policy,you can watch it wheneveras many times as you want,it is fully on demand,and I feel that it is sucha great investment to make in yourself.There are so many students who ask mewhere can they invest â¹500.I tell them â¹500 cannot change their life,unless you can invest â¹500 every monthwith absolute dedication.But if you have â¹500 only,then the best investment would beto buy a course.Invest in yourself because thatis such a great way for you to grow.Other investments can be,invest in eating right,invest in buying good trainingfor yourself,invest in good teachers for yourselfjust as Udemy,invest in good tutors,invest in good learning,invest in good books,all these investments are only possiblethrough money,and if you make that investment,it is by far a far better investmentthan any investment that you makein mutual funds or stocksor crypto or anywhere else.That's how there isa very famous English phrasePennywise and pound foolish.This means thinking too muchfor small change,but as soon there's more money involved,then the thinkingand the wisdom disappears.How?We spend so much moneyon eating random food,having random parties,but if we have to buy a good chairfor work from home,we won't spend money on it,if we have to buy nice running shoes,we won't spend money on it,if we have to buy a good mattressto sleep,we will not spend money for that,if we have to buy good food to eat,organic food,if we have to buy vegetablesand fruits properly,we will not do that,and that is such a waste ofhow you think about money.Money should be used for your well-being.If you are not happy with that money,then what is the use of that money,and that is why invest in yourselfwhich is the best investment to make.Number 5:The person with whom you decideto spend your life will greatlyinfluence your money decisions.This is not something that we mostlytalk about or speak about, but it is true.Your spouse will influenceyour money decisions so much,not because they want to,but because you have adapted to them.So how much risk you will takewith your money, also depends onhow much risk they can take with money.Where you will spend that money,how you will spend it,how much you will spend it,when you will spend it,a lot of that is going to get determinedby how your partner thinks about money.I often say that your partnerimpacts three things,your financial decisions,your physical decisions,and your emotional decisions,and if these three decisionsare important to you,which will be important to every person,then you should spend time findingthe right partner.It's not a small decision,it's not a trivial decision,it's a very important decision,and once it's done right, life can change.My life changed,and that's why I'm standing heretelling you that if you finda person to spend your life withwho thinks the same wayabout money as you do,then you are going to have such an easy,better, and happier life.Shocking fact number 6:There is no person who wants to get richbut slowly, and that is a tragedy.I will tell a very interesting story.You must have heard the nameof Warren Buffett,he is one of the richest peoplein the world.You must have heard the name ofBill Gates, the founder of Microsoft,and he is also considered one ofthe richest people in the world.So they were talking on stage one day,and Bill Gates asks Warren Buffett,they are very good friends,Warren, your investment philosophyis so easy, so simple,buy good company stocksand forget about them,hold them for a long duration,because if there is value in them,that value will compound slowlyand generate immense money for you.It's simple enough isn't it, Warren,then why so many people haven't gottenrich off this investment thesis?And Warren Buffett laughs and says,Bill, that's because nobody wantsto get rich slowly.Every person is eager to becomerich overnight,and that's when we end up makingthe most mistakes.If you look at any ofyour investment failures,where you have lost money,it is because of greed,that is because you thought your moneywill grow quickly.But the beauty of making money grow slowlyis that you care about yourselfin that journey,you keep enjoying your life,and ultimately, when you make money,you know what to do with it.That's why I say that budgetingis such a great way to think about life.I created a video on 50:30:20which says that 50% of your monthly incomeshould be spent on your needs,like your EMI, rent, water,electricity fees, and all,30% should be spent on your wants,if you want to buy a phone,go on a vacation, have a party,buy clothes, please do thatbut within that 30%,and 20% is towards your investments,towards your future,for the big things you have to doin the future, like by a house,children's marriage,for your own retirement,whatever the case may be.And because of this budget,you will beautifully be able to live life.You will be able to live today,plan for your future,and you will do everything thatyou need to do.If you do this, you will get rich slowlybut beautifully.That is a shocking fact that nobodywants to do this becauseit's not exciting, it's not sexy.You want to get rich overnight,don't do that!Shocking fact number 7:The job of money is not to make you rich,it is to make you free, to set you free.Many people have money.If your monthly salary is coming,then you are rich, you have money,but maybe you are not free,because the day that income stops coming,the day that salary stops coming,you will collapse.That's why salary is called a drug,that the world's biggest drug isa monthly salary, because as long asit keeps coming, it is addictive,and the day it goes,such withdrawal symptoms comethat you can't live.But the right use of moneyis to set you free,you can do whatever you wantwith your time,you can do whatever you wantwith your life.And what does that mean?It means that you have done yourinvestment in such a way thatthe return it generates every monthcovers your monthly expenses,and your entire expenditure is covered,when that happens,then you are truly free.It doesn't mean you will retire,never work, maybe you want to, maybe not.Like I want to workfor the rest of my life,but I am not working for money,because I know that I have enough moneythat I don't have to workfor money anymore.I work for myself, work for pleasure,work for you guys,so I get up and I do what I do,and that's making money,but it is not somethingthat I work towards.I work towards a very different approach,and that is what you would wantfrom your money as well.So shocking fact number 7:The job of money is not to make you rich,it is to make you free.Number 8:You can become rich with money,but being rich does not meanthat you are wealthy.That is a very different thing.As I said that your monthly salarycan make you rich,but wealth will happen onlywhen your invested money is generatingso much return for you that it is enoughfor your monthly expense,you are not dependenton your monthly salary.You're doing it because of the love of it,you're doing it because you want to do it,you are doing it by will, by choice,not by compulsion,and that is the true definitionof being wealthy.Becoming rich is easy,becoming wealthy is very difficult!Shocking fact number 9:One of my favorite,money doesn't change you,it shows who you really are.Money doesn't change you,it brings out who you really are.So if you are stingy,more money will show your stinginessto the world, you will show yourself.If you are kind-hearted, big-hearted,and help people, then with more moneyyou will help more people.The real you will emerge.And that is the beautiful thingabout money but also the shocking thingabout money.People often say,Dude, money has changed you.No!That person was like that,because of that money his realityhas come out, and that's what money does.So don't think that if you seea person changed because of money,then they have changed.No!They were like this,that was their nature,money only brought that naturein front of you.And that is why if you are a good person,I often say that, money in the handsof good people is a beautiful thing.Number 10:The most saddening factbut an honest fact.There are very few of us who knowhow much money we need in life.if I ask you this,How much money do you need in life?You won't have the answer.Some people will say â¹10-20 lakhs,because they think that they will livetheir whole life with this much money,but they have no idea of life,then there will be other peoplewho will say â¹300-400 crore rupees,this much money that they don't haveto think about anything,but that too is a wrong approach.Why?Because unless you have an accurate numberof how much money you are chasing,you will always be chasing.It's like running in a race whereyour finish line is not yet decided,so at what point do you stop running?Never, and that is the tragedythat most people go through.Because they do not knowfor what purpose they are working,they just keep on working.I often say that every human beinghas two lives,one life that you spendto get this amount,and the other one after that,because at the point this entire amountcomes to you,you know now you don't have torun after money,you don't have to live for money,and now you can live lifethe way you want to.Number one is mandatory,every human being has to live life.Number two is optional,but there are very few peoplewho can live this number two life.Number two is not black money, okay?This means we can live this second life.I made a whole video on this,as for me that number is â¹21.7 crores,the day I get â¹21,70,00,000,I know that every happiness, desire,need, and wish of my lifecan be fulfilled,and I'm working towards that number,but I also know that at the pointwhen I'll have this money,I'll never have to work for money again,and that will be freedom,going back to an earlier fact.So these were the 10 shocking factsabout money.Which one did you find most shocking,most hard-hitting,please tell us in the comment section,and if there is any other factyou want to share with all of us,please do share that too.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
