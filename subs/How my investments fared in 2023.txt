This year was a test,a very interesting test,and it may be the first year for youwhen you saw a downward trendfor your investments,because a lot of people started investingin the beginning of 2020, 2021, and 2022,and then the market changed,and it started to go down,and everything started to collapseand look very scary.So in this video, I will not give youa kind of confidence,because I also had negative returns,but I will give you a reality check,that what is happening with youis probably happening with everyone,and it's not that you are stupidor you don't know anything,or even worse,you should stop investingbecause you have negative returns,if anything this may be the best timeto make a massive returnover a long period of time.So all my investments in 2022,where did I invest?What was its result?And based on that, all my paperwork,all in its true sense!Ok, I have 4 investments.Firstly, actually a disclaimer,number 1: These investments arebetween me and my wife,so both of us draw a salaryfrom our company,and that salary is for ourhousehold expenses like Home EMI,children's school fees,household expenses, blah blah blah,and the remaining amount goestowards investments.Number 2: The investments ofour company are separate.The company's money is a lot,and of course, it needs to bea lot more secure,so the company's risk profileis very different fromthe individual risk profile of meand my wife.Personally, we take a lot of riskwith our money,but we take less risk withthe company's money,so a lot of that is just investedin traditional mutual funds.As a company, we cannot invest outside,we cannot invest in crypto,so all of that is very very different.The money is invested instandard mutual funds or liquid funds,so it is very important to understandthe risk profile that this needn't beyour risk profile,or whatever we do with our money,that is the risk profile.Number 3: Very important.None of these are recommendations.I will name specific instruments,specific platforms,but please don't treat itas financial advice,because this is how my wifeand I have invested our money,shouldn't be how you invest your money.You will have to do your own due diligenceand please be smart around that.There are four areas where we invest.We invest in the Indian stock market,in the US stock market, in crypto,and in startups.We had invested our moneyin these four places.How much we had investedat the beginning of 2022,and what is its value at the end of 2022,that is what we are going to show.First, let's start withthe Indian stock market.In the Indian Stock Market,we have divided our money into two parts,one is smallcases,and another is mutual funds.We do not do individual stock pickingas I do not have any expertisein stock picking.In fact, whenever I have done it,it has been bad, and you will see itvery clearly in the US stocks,I have taken so much beatingin US stock picking, anyway!So in the Indian stock market,I don't pick stocksthough I keep tracking.So what I do interestinglyand maybe you can also do that,is that I make my own thesis,but since I am not an expertso I don't invest in it that much.But according to that thesis,I buy one stock of that companyand I just let it be,like there for the past 5-10 years.Like 1 stock, not 1,I think 5 stocks of HDFC are there,I don't even know forhow many years have I kept it,because at some point, I used to thinkthat HDFC is a good bankand I should buy its stock,but largely,it is in a portfolio of stocks.Our money is invested in four smallcases.All Weather Investing is a very niceequity, debt, and gold combination.So in a way, as the name suggests,it's All Weather Investing,and whether the market is up or down,it keeps doing well.Equity and Gold, which is littlein equity and little in gold,so it brings in a flavor of gold as wellbecause we don't buy gold separately.Two where most of our money is investedare momentum investing portfolioswas where we investin the momentum strategy.I have seen this only in smallcase,I don't know where else is it,so Weekend Investing Momentumand Capital Mind Momentum,we have invested our moneyin these two smallcases,and here is the split.In All Weather Investing,at the beginning of 2022,our invested amount was â¹7.4 lakhs.That grew and by the end of 2022,it became â¹7.9 lakhswhich is a yearly return of about 6.8%.Equity and Gold,we invested around â¹7.5 lakhsat the beginning of Jan 2022,and towards the end,it has now become 8.3which is a surprising 10.7%,which I did not expect,because I never expected 10.7 inEquity and Gold in this market.Weekend Investing, â¹22 lakhs,22.1 to be precise,and at the end of the year,it is 23.7 which is an annual returnof about 7.2%.And then Capital Mind Momentum,37.8 lakhs, and in the end it is 42.1,which is approximately 11.4%.So this is the performance of smallcases.Again as I said these arenot recommendations these are justsmallcases that we have got.I have not added the cost of transactionand the cost of ownership here,so these are just absolute returns.Their cost would be separate,and of course, the dividends,I haven't actually trackedthe dividend as well,so the dividends will also generatea return additionally,but let's assume that this iswhat it is broadly.It doesn't have the cost of transaction,the cost of smallcase,and the cost of smallcase charges also.Then comes mutual funds.We have taken two mutual funds.One is Axis Focused 25 Fund,and then the Parag Parikh Flexi Cap.We invested â¹20 lakhs in eachat the beginning of the year,and both of them have given usnegative returns this year.So Axis Focused is down to18.3 lakhs from 20,and Parag Parikh is down to 19.1 from 20,which means an annual return of -8.5%for Axis Focused,and -4.5% for Parag Parikh.I am totally ok with that,because as I said, the marketwas fluctuating a lot this year,there was a lot of volatility,and both of these mutual fundsare high-volatility mutual funds.Out of this, there are international,like Parag Parikh made someinternational investments,international was as it is messed up,specifically US stocks,and there was a fair bit of volatilityin India as well,so to manage that I am totally okwith these negative returns,because as I said, in the long term,these negative returns will gradually,over a period of time, 5-10 years,become positive.So overall this was the India portfolio.If I were to summarise India portfolio,â¹1,15,00,000 approximately wasthe starting value,and by the time it reached December,it became â¹1,19,00,000, not a high jump,but whatever it is has been delivered.Second, let's talk about the US market.The US market should be absolutelya great lesson for all of you,because I made the same mistake therewhich I tell all of you not to do.I picked stocks.And which stocks did I pick?Which I thought are good stocksaccording to my bias.I am a tech entrepreneur,and I am in the tech industryfor the last 10-12 years,so I thought tech is everything,the whole world will work onlybecause of tech,so I had bought numerous stocks of tech.Of course, I had bought them forthe last 2-3 years,and this year, I started doubling downbecause I thought the rates are reducing,but I started making the big mistakewhich is when the price goes down,you start betting more on them.So you are kind of trying to timethe marketwhich is not a smart thing to do.So I bought a lot of US stocksnamely Shopify,which is an Amazon equivalentin e-commerce but for direct retailers.Block which used to be a companycalled Square,it's a payment companyand really good at what it does,but of course, it failed.Tesla!I really like the guy,but of course, Tesla also failed.Asana is a software thatwe personally use.So when we started using italmost a year back,I bought its stocks becauseif I am a consumerthen I would love to do that as well.Cloudflare.We use Cloudflare a lot.It is basically a server management tool.Snap.I really believed in Snap,I still do which is whyI am still holding on to it.Affirm.Affirm is a financial services company.They had a tie-up with Amazon.And then to ensure thatI don't get carried awayand blow away all my moneyin the US stocksbecause I am such a bad stock picker,I'd also bought ETFwhich is the equivalent ofa mutual fund in the US.And I took the ETF of Nasdaq 100which is basically the top 100 stockson the Nasdaq index which isa big index in the US.And to give you a sense ofhow the market has been.Shopify's stock, 72% down this year.Block's stock, 59 % down this year.Tesla's stock, 53% down this year.Asana, 81% down this year.Cloudflare, 57%.Snap, 76%.Affirm, 82%.And Nasdaq 100,only 28%!Now it seems only,but if you really think about it,that's the beauty, right?A portfolio of stocksthat is actively managed by someone else,you are not putting your mind into it,you have diversified,every industry is represented,and all the ups and downs ofthe volatility are managed,based on that,US Nasdaq 100 ETF is 29 % down.And the stocks that I,Ankur Warikoo had picked,all down!Now that would also mean an opportunity,because now I know,since my income tax refund is due,and it's going to be a good amount,I definitely know that I will investthat money in the US stock market,because I also have to rebalance,and I'll come back tomy rebalancing strategy,that how I have to rebalancemy portfolio so that it gives methe alpha with the beta that I want,which means gain with the volatilitythat I am ok with.So this is my US and to give youspecific numbers.In Shopify, I invested 10 lakhs,they are 2.8 lakhs right now.I invested 9.8 lakhs in Block,they are 4 lakhs right now.I invested 6.3 lakhs in Tesla,they are 2.9 lakhs right now.I invested 5 lakhs in Asana,they are not even 1 lakh right now,it's 90,000.I invested 5 lakhs in Cloudflare,they are 2.2 lakhs right now.I invested 4.5 lakhs in Snap,they are 1.1 right now.3.7 lakhs in Affirm,they are 0.7 right now.And thank God,I invested 60 lakhs in Nasdaq,they are 42.7 lakhs right now.In a way, that investment of 60 lakhssaved me a lot of money.The total investment in the US marketat the start of the year was â¹1,04,00,000,and at the end of the year,it is around â¹57,00,000.So a big big dip, but I'll come towhy that is kind of ok.Then the third one was crypto.Actually, let me start with startupsbecause it was more in startups,and then crypto can be last.Startups are whereI do personal investments.If it is an Indian startup,then I try to do it withthe company itself,because it is far easier to do itthrough the company.So my personal investment in startupsis where I have to invest internationally,because I cannot send money abroadthrough the company.So anything which is a US companyor an outside India company, any startup,I invest my personal money there,and that was a total of â¹60 lakhs.It is very difficult to tellits current value becauseunless the startup does not exitor raise another round or shuts down,the mark-to-market value,basically the equivalent ofif it was a stock thenwhat would be its value,is very difficult to tellbecause this is a private limited companyor privately listed company,so you don't know.So I assumed, which is by the waya wrong assumption that this is 60 only.The reason why it is wrong isbecause this year there wasa lot of re-annulmentaround the startup world,valuations were hit big time,funding has dried up,many startups are doing layoffs,or some of them are on the brinkof shutting down.Now none of that has happened tothe startups that I have invested in,but it is fair to assume thatit has reduced from 60,but because I don't have a number,I have assumed it to be 60.So my returns would be over-reported,but you should know that.Finally, coming to crypto.I have a focus in Crypto thatI have to get1 Bitcoin, 10 Ethereum, and 100 Solana.These are the only 3 coins thatI invest in because these arethe 3 projects which I thinkfairly represent web3and the blockchain revolution.All others seem to be hogwash to me,nor do I understand them,but I have fairly understoodBitcoin, Ethereum, and Solanato whatever extent I can.And my focus in this is one:ten:hundred.A large part of that I had boughtin 2021 itself,and then I stocked it in Vauld,which means basically,you can keep these coins thereand earn a regular fixed rate of return.Unfortunately,Vauld went through a bad time,and that money is stuck,still cannot be withdrawn,I had 30 lakhs there.And I have assumed to be safe,that I won't get anything of that 30.I do know that the invested valueof that 30 is 10 lakhs right now,but I am assuming that I won't getthat 10 lakhs while I keep tracking iton the weekly emailsthat I receive as a Vauld customer,but I have assumed that 30 to be zero.But to get back to myone:ten:hundred target,I started investing again,so I have invested â¹4 lakhs each inBitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana,and over a period of timethrough this year to maintain that ratioabout which I will talk.The value of that has not been reallygood because crypto went througha bad phase this year.So my Bitcoin of 4 lakhs is 1.2 lakhs,my Ethereum of 4 lakhs is 1.9 lakhs,and my Solana of 4 lakhs is 0.3 lakhs.So Bitcoin has gone down 69% for me,52% gone down for Ethereum,and 92% gone down for Solana.So Crypto essentially has beena complete wipeout.So approximately, I investeda total of 42 lakhs in crypto,and now they are 3.5,because I wiped out 30 lakhs.And then 60 lakhs in startups.So my investment is in these four areas,Indian stock market, US Stock Market,startups, and crypto.And the reason why these specific numbersis because I have to maintain a ratio.So approximately35% in the Indian stock market,35% in the US stock market,20% in startups, and 10% in crypto.This has been my allocationfor the last 3 odd years,and I want to maintain it.So if you will see, this year,how did I do it?I invested 37% in the Indian stock market,34% in the US stock market,10% in Crypto, and 19% in startups.So this was essentially my layoutfor the start of 2022.Now, these values have changed.For example, since my valuein the Indian stock market is1 crore 19 lakhs right now,57 in the US stock market,3.5 in crypto,and I have assumed it to be60 in startups,the ratio has changed.So as of now,my Indian stock market portfolio is 50%of my total portfolio,US Stock Market is 24%,only 1% is left in crypto,and 25% in startups.So what do I have to do?Basically, I have to rebalance.So my focus in 2023 would beto invest more moneyor whatever money I invest,the ratio of that money should be suchthat I come back to35% Indian, 35% US, 20% startup,and 10% crypto.That means in 2023, I will allocatea lot more money to the US marketand to crypto,and slightly less money tothe Indian stock market and startups.That may not be that I am investingless in terms of the absolute amount.It could be that the moneyI invested last year, I may invest more,but as a ratio, these four will change.I also believe that that is smart.Why?Because the US stock market isso down right nowthat it's a great time to invest.Historically, whenever tech stocksare battered so badly, that iswhen they have given the highest returnsover a 10-20 year period.Last, this happened in 2000 I guess,around the stock bubble when it burst,and it happened kind of temporarilyin 2007,but such a big bubble bursthas not happened since then.So I genuinely believe that tech stocksare wonderfully priced right now,but again if you want to invest,please do not try to pick tech stocks,because you don't know which stockwill go up or not,I certainly don't, given my expertise,but if you can invest in an ETFthat is tracking the tech stocks,or you can invest ina portfolio of stocksthat is representing the tech stocks,then that is a better strategy.Crypto, only if you are a believer.I am a believer in Crypto.I will only focus on these three,Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana,and I will try and get to thatone:ten:hundred target thatI have set for myself,and if I do that then that's great.Prices are very attractive right now,so if I can deploy that amount of moneythen I can certainly get to this point.Platforms that I use.For smallcase, I use Smallcase,it is something that I haveactively spoken about.Smallcase has its own charges.Some smallcases are not freebut they are paid for, so that's a charge.There is another charge forthe rebalancing of smallcases.And then, of course,the brokerage charges that you haveto pay which is driven bythe Demat account or the brokerage accountthat you are using.All my stock market purchases,buy and sell, are through Zerodha,so that is my favored platformfor buying all that.For mutual funds, I use coin by Zerodha.That is a great place becauseit's free,as in there is no transaction costattached to it.You buy directly into the mutual fund,and you are the custodian of thatwhich I wonderfully love.For the US Stock market,all my purchases are through INDmoney.I am also an investor in INDmoney,that is a disclaimer here.If you use it, please be aware thatif I am saying something,it is a biased opinion,but I really love the product,and you can see more than a croreof my personal money has been deployedby INDmoney.For Crypto, earlier I used to do itthrough WazirX and Vauld,now I do almost all of it through Binance,so that is where almostall my crypto lies,and at some point in time,I will move it to an offline drive,so that I secure it,and that's the way thatI am thinking about it.For startups, I mostly do allmy investments through AngelList.I am an accredited investor on AngelList,so I get access to a lot of deal flowthrough AngelList,and that is something that I use.In India, either I do it directlythrough the founders itselfbecause I know them personally,or I use AngelList Indiawhich is also available in Indiaor LetsVenture.These are the two platforms,if I am not going directwith the founder itself.These are the platforms thatI use to deploy my money.Is there something I am missing?No.This is pretty much it.And so to summarise,my Indian stock market performancethis year has been 4% return,my US stock market performancehas been -45%,my Crypto has been -92%,and I assume that in startupsit has been so far no loss no gain,which is as I said,most likely is not true,definitely, I had some loss,but if I were to assumethat it is 60 only,then my overall portfolio this yearwhich is a total deploymentof â¹3,11,00,000which started in Jan 2022 istoday valued at â¹2,40,00,000,and that gives me an annual returnof -22.8%.This is a very risky portfolio,which I said is something thatmy wife and I are comfortable with,because most of our money is throughthe company which is not owned by usbut technically by the company ofwhich we are the only owners,but nonetheless, it is in the company,and that is safer, Indian mutual funds,long term, consistent growth, and so on.But with our own money,our personal income thatwe get through our salary,we adopt a risky approach,and that has given us a negative 22.Last year, this very same approachhad given us a positive 40%.So these ups and downs area part and parcel, it is by design,it is not something thatwe are surprised by,it is something thatwe have consciously chosen.According to your risk profile,you can also do your deployment.The key is in which mixwill you deploy your assets.You can do it in gold, in real estate,Indian stock market,US Stock Market, crypto, startups,whatever it is that you wish to consider,all the things are at your disposal.However, it is important thatyou stay true to that,and most importantly,you are comfortable with whatevervolatility or risk emerges from that.My biggest lesson of all.Never make any investment in lifebecause of which you haveto lose your sleep.I thankfully did not loseany of my sleep in 2022,because everything that I didwas according to my principles.I could have done better,a lot better,but I have learnedand that is far more important.I wish you all a wonderful investing 2023.Hope this year is the best for all of you.You learn a lot, your money grows,and through that, you also grow.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
