Iâve tried a cinematic recordingin this one, Piyush.So, take that, music, light.Again, instrumental, piano.And itâs a reflective type of reel,so please pick music based on that.Relationships.Relationships are strange, arenât they?When we start a new relationshipof friendship, of love,then everything is perfect,everything is beautiful.Because everybody wants to showhow ready they are for this relationship.And then we slowly start seeingweaknesses.Slowly, arguments start.There is anger, there is resentment.And we become so sad in that relationshipthat we forget that we startedthis relationship to be happy.We forget that if weâre not happyin this relationship,then why is that relationshipeven required?And I always remind myself,that if Iâm not happy in a relationship,then I need to do everythingwith which I can be happyin this relationship.Because that is why I wanted to bein that relationship in the first place.Whatever that means,whatever that takes,I want this relationship to make meand the other person happy.
