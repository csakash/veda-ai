Number 1:And to show this,I read a very funny quote.At the age of 20,we all think what peoplemight be thinking about us,at the age of 40,we don't care what people think about us,but at 60,we realize that people are not thinkinganything about us.They were thinking aboutwhat people must be thinking about us.And that is the biggest lessonthat we learn very late in life.What people are thinking about us,what people will say,how people will see it,that is a trap.This is such a cage whereif we get trappedthen it is very difficult to get out.From childhood we are taught, told,and shown that what people will say,what people will think is very important,because we are social animals,we live among people,so everything depends onhow we behave in front of people,and what people will think about us.So if you went to IIT or became CAor went to AIIMS or cleared UPSC,then you have some status,otherwise while feeling embarrassed,don't even express thatyou have studied froma lousy Warikoo Institute of Technology,because what will people say!If you have decided not to get married,or have children very late,or not have children at all,what will people say?If you want to sell your house,sell your car,move to a nicer bigger house,which is rented,or want to settle in the mountains,or live in Goa, what will people say?If you want to move outof your parents' house,and live an independent life by yourself,staying close to your parents,giving them all the happiness they want,but not living with them,then what will people say?It is very late in life thatwe realize that because of thinkingabout what people will say,we have taken so many decisionsfor people and not for ourselves,and that has to be something thatyou recognise,has to break inside of you.What will people sayand what will people think,without caring about that,you should bother aboutwhat you will say and think.In fact, we should talk about two people.Your 8-year-old selfand your 80-year-old self.What will your 8-year-old self thinkabout you?What will your 80-year-old self thinkabout you?If these two are happywith your current life,they feel proud in a way,then you are set.If these two don't feel good,then how do other people matter, dude?Number 2:We should not wait for tomorrowto do the thing that we should do today.Till the age of 32 years,I abused my own body a lot.Not substance abuse,but just by eating, and simply...It was not simple,so I will not use that word.I grew up in Delhi,so eating chole bhature, aloo tikki,chat papdi, bhelpuri, sugar, fried,fritters, samosas at any time.Sleeping and waking up at the wrong time.No rhythm in eating and sleeping.And I kept telling myself,I'll do it tomorrow!Or all those people who are stuckin their jobs and keep telling themselves,Once we are retired,then we'll live life,because till then it's time to work.Friend, by the time of retirement,your teeth would be gone,hands and feet would be weak,and in a way your body would be likean unemployed being,then what to live for after that?Start living now.So whatever you have to do today,do not postpone it till tomorrow.This is the biggest mistake,which you realize very late,and by then it might have been too late.Don't make that mistake.Go and live your life.If you want to go and travel,please make your budget and go,and do it.If you want to say I love youto the person that you want to,please don't wait till tomorrow,say it today.Probably if you don't say it today,then you will never be able to say it.If you want to do something for yourself,if you want to leave that toxic job,if you want to get out of thattoxic relationship,if you want to spend well on yourselfor your parents or your siblingsor your friends, please do it.Don't wait till retirement.Don't think that I have to dothese things today,I am compelled to do them,and I just have to do them.When I will have more timeand money tomorrow,then I will think abouthow to live my life.Wrong!It may be too late by then.Number 3:Take care of your mind and your body.When we are in our 20s,as happened with me,we don't realizehow much we misuse our bodies,because our 20s is still young,and we don't see any signs in our body.No matter how much crap we eat,how much crap we drink,abuse our body in any way,don't maintain our sleep cycle,don't keep any routine,don't do any physical activity,whatever, still our body moves well,because it is still young in 20s.Gradually, when we reach 30-40 years,then we realize our mistakes becausethose mistakes start showing.Diabetes starts showing,weight gain starts appearing,joint pain starts appearing,back pain starts appearing,and then it becomes too lateor too expensiveor too complicated to solve it.Don't make this mistake!I have been through this mistake,and I would never want that an incident,an accident or a compulsion shouldforce you to change your life.It happened to me,and I consider myself very fortunatethat because of that incident,I got a second life.I genuinely got a new lifeat the age of 32 years,where through surgery,I had to be on bed rest for 3 months,I walked using crutches for 5 months,and for those 8 months,I couldn't do everything thatI wanted to do in life becauseI had gone through that surgery.And at that point, I promised myselfthat I will not treat my body like this,I would not want to livemy life like this.I wanted to change it,and then I started getting fit,being physically active,going to the gym, playing a sport,eating healthy, sleeping on time,taking charge of my time,#time management.It's happening a lot today,as if it doesn't every day, Ankur!And it then became a ritual.It is genuinely my way of living life.And I am so thankful for that incident,but I don't want you to changebecause of an incident.So please, until it's too late,don't wait for it.Make your move towardsmaintaining your body,both physically and mentally.Number 4:One such realization that we oftenget very late in life is thatour studies do not end inschool and college.And this is a big problem in India.Often parents in India,we ourselves also think thatwe should finish our studies soon.What does it really mean?What does it mean to finish studies?Will you stop learning?Will you finish learning?Will you not read something new?Are you realizing that now in the worldof AI, everydaysomething or the other is changing?Growing so fast...It's changing and growing so fastthat no one can keep track of it.So what you studied in school and college,if that study is over,and you don't want to study anymore,then my friend, bye-bye, tata,see you later, nothing can be done here,life is finished!You have to be learning every single day.This is a reality now that only thatperson will progress who knowshow to read and learn.Reading and learning, not from books,not by joining a school or college,they can learn whatever is neededwhenever.And you all excel in that.You can go and type anything on YouTube,and your generation which hasthe ability to learn online,the ability to learn through free content,the ability to make use of that content,practice on your own,and become such great graphic designers,coders, visualisers, product managers,product designers, anything.Many among you have learned these thingsby themselves, nobody has taught them,that passion never has to stop.Never at all!Because if you stop learning,and if you say,studies are over, education is over.Game over, my friend!You won't be able to progress.And now the world is going to be such thatevery 5 years one has to learnsomething new,and every 10 yearsone has to change careers.Career not in the sense of the job,but in terms of industry itself,in terms of the role itself.The role you are playing may not bethere in 10 years,a new role will have been created,and you will have to adaptto that until you die.That is the reality.Don't make the mistake thata lot of people make,and they realize it much later.One should never stop learning.Number 5:I will try to explain this beforegiving you what it is.I am 42 years old, so there isa gap between your generationand my generation.There is a fundamental differencebetween your generation and mine,which is neither your fault,nor our supremacy,or whatever, our caliber.When I was growing up,and I grew up in India,it's the story of the 1980s and 1990s,we got everything by waiting,and nothing happened quickly.You had to wait to get milk,you had to wait to get a phone,you had to wait to watch TV shows,you had to wait to listen to songs,you had to wait to watch pictures,you had to wait to buy clothes,you had to wait for schoolor college admission,you had to wait for joining a club.Everything was done with waiting,because it was a new country,new in the sense thatit had just got independence,there was a lot of demand,the supply had not been built up yet,and the internet had never come.So there was a lot of demandfor everything, limited supply,and infinite patience was required.So without any choice of ours,it was not that we were very happythat we had to wait,it was our compulsion that we had to wait.But this led to a good habit,of waiting, and waiting createsanother very interesting habit,that of patience.You recognize how to be patient.Now with your generation,again not your fault,the problem is patience,or rather the lack of it,because you were born in a generation,a world where everything happensinstantly.If you want books, click.If you want the latest videos, click.If you want the latest moviesor songs, click.Love, swipe right.Whatever you want,at the speed of thoughtdelivered to your doorstep.So you don't have to wait.You don't know the value of patience,and it is only much laterthat you realize,and I hope it's not too latewhen you realize thatthe most beautiful things in life,the most valuableand the most important things comewith waiting.Love, fulfillment, satisfaction,and joy are not achieved overnight.You can get entertainment instantly,but happiness and peacecome with time only.It will come onlywhen you can do one thing so wellthat you will feel that peace inside,and you will then see the joyof long-term patience,of waiting it out,and seeing good things take time.People realize this thingvery late in life.They want everything overnight.They want to be rich overnight.They want love overnight.They want fame overnight.They want promotions overnight.I get so many emails,Ankur, I am 18, my aim is to becomea billionaire by 21.I hope it happens,but it is not going to happen.Even if it happened,you would not even know how it happened.You will not be able to repeat it again.Why do you want such a life?You'd rather that whatever happensto you happens slowlyand so beautifully that younever miss anything,and you still keep moving forward.That will be true life,and that will be a life of patience.Number 6:And it is very hard-hitting.Your duty in this lifeis not to save people,it is to help them.I'll say that again.Your duty in this life is to help people,not to save them.But we spend our whole lifein saving people.We feel like we have a responsibilityto save people.We feel that if we do not save them,then we will not be called a savior,we will not be able to changesomeone's life,we will not be able to give someonethe meaning that they should seein their life.Hey dude, first save yourself,first help yourself,first take care of yourself.When you go on an airplane,and there is a safety announcement,the air hostess says,if there is a shortage of oxygen,then oxygen masks will fall from above,put it on your mouth and pull it,then the oxygen pressure will start.Before putting the mask on others,make sure that you have put thatmask on yourself first.And that is a truth of life.Save yourself before savingsomeone else in life,take care of your own life.You will never find peace in the factthat you saved someone else.You will only find peace in the factthat you saved yourself,and through that,you were able to save others.That is the essence of life.And I have seen so many people in lifewho put their whole life at stakejust to save people, and in the end,all they have is regret,and worse, resentment,because they feel that the peoplefor whom they sacrificed their whole life,they did not turn aroundand thank them even once,did not accept or acknowledgehis entire role.And then you are like,why did I do this?And it feels like a waste.And I am not suggesting it is a waste.All I am saying is,if you had focused on yourself first,anybody else that you end up helpingwould never feel likethey have to return that favorbecause it is not a transaction,it is something that has becomea part of you.And number 7:The most important realizationwhich happens towards the end.There is a very beautiful book,The 5 Regrets of the Dying.There was an Australian nursewho used to work in a hospitalwhere there were a lot of elderly people.And because she experienced deathon almost a daily basis,in conversation she figured outthat all these people had some hopesand some regrets.And then she realized that these fiveare very common.And one of them was,I wish I had chosen to be happier.What does this mean?Our mind is our dearest friendand our most harmful enemy,because our mind can convince usfor anything.If it says thatwe'll not be able to do it,then you know what,we will not be able to do it.If it says we will do it,then you know what,maybe we will.And it will have no sense,no foundation either.It will just happen becausewe thought of it.So when we indulge in negative self-talk,when we just keep cursing ourselvesthat we will not be able to do it,no one loves us,we will never be worthy of anyone,we'll never be able to keep anyone happy,we will never be able to do anythingbig in life,every person will go ahead of you,you are confused, you are stupid,you will not be able to do it,you are lacking something,you are worthless,then it becomes a reality.Our mind convinces us that it's the truth.But the truth is nothing,truth is a perception.Now if we reverse this truthand assure ourselves thatyes, I am not where I want to be,but I can reach there, with hard work,with time, with full dedication,by doing whatever I want to do,I can get there.That negative self-talk translatedinto positive self-talk is allthe difference that is needed.The best example of thisis Olympic athletics,where if the interviewer asksthe athletes before the race,How are you feeling?And 2 answers are there,either excited or nervous.And it has been consistently seenthat those who are winners,say excited,and those who are mostly,not losers actually,because how can they be losersif they are participating in the Olympics,but those who do not win the race,usually say nervous.But interestingly, biologically,excitement and nervousness generatethe same body reaction,there is no difference.The body doesn't differentiatebetween excitement and nervousness.We just give it a name.And whether we call it excitementor nervousness makes the difference.If you call your nervousness excitement,because it is the same body reaction,then you have a higher chanceof actually feeling excited.But if you call your nervousnessnervousness,then there is a higher chanceyou will feel nervous.It is very late in life thatwe discover that the storieswe tell ourselves about ourselvesin front of the mirrorbecome our reality,and we can change that realityif we choose to.Will you or will you not?We realize these 7 things so late in lifethat by then it is probably too late.And my aim through this videowas to make you aware of these 7 things,which aren't new or unique,you all have thought about it,maybe heard about it too,but today through this video,you will make a promise for yourself,not for me,that you would not allow any ofthese 7 to become a long life regret.You will make the change today.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
