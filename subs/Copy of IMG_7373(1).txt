Three things that I spendmy most money on.Last year, me and my wifecollectively madeeighty lac rupees.Out of which,most went to taxes.We invested a lot,But here are the three thingsthat we spent ourmost money on.Number one, education.Education for our kids,and education for ourselves.On books, on courses.That makes us move forward.Number two,on freeing up our time.We want our timeto be free, so thatwe can use that timeto think and do.So anything that we can doto buy our time,getting help,getting technology,making people work for usso that we can workfor ourselves,is an important ingredientof spending wisely.And number three,experiences and travel.A thing that opens upyour mind, and you get toknow so much about the worldand yourself.At the end of it,why are we earning money?Precisely for that!
