Today with us are YouTube industry'sJai and Veeru,Ramesh and Suresh,Karan and Arjun, Ram and Laxman,they are known by many names,but we all know them by the name ofBhuvan and Rohit.Thank you so much Bhuvan,thank you so much Rohit for joining us.It's a pleasure to have youon the channel.Thank you, Ankur!Thank you!I will ask both of you,and this question will be for both of youfor yourself and for each other.You have known each other for a long time,and have worked for a long time.Bhuvan and Rohit,what has been the biggest shiftor change in you as a personin the last 10 years?So let's start with you Bhuvan.What do you think has changedthe most in you in the last 10 years?There are two notable changes.One change I am working on right nowis patience.Earlier I didn't have it at all.Earlier it used to be that everythingshould be done immediately,everything should be done asap,but now many peoplehave taught me patience.And they have also taught me thatit is very important to havezero expectations from life,it is very important to havezero expectations from things,from people,because if you set a benchmarkof expectations,and it doesn't meet slightly,then you feel that there is somethinglacking in you only.So I have reduced those expectations.Even from yourself?Even from myself.Absolutely!Meaning one is self-trust and self-belief,that is there, but I never say thatI will do it,because when I try to do itand it doesn't work, then it disappoints.That's so wonderful!What about you Rohit?Same, I think I am a very impatient personand react intensely.But I think in the last 7-8 years,not because he is here,but I learned patience from Bhuvan.One has to work a lot to become patience,it needs hard work.Everybody works hard but you canrerun everything to make it better.For example, Bhuvan sits on an editfor 4 months,which needs a lot of patience.The one who made a video in 4-5 hours,edited and released it in 5-6 hours,for him spending 5 months ona piece of contentneeds a lot of patience.I think I have learned from him that bea little, not a little,be very humble, and be very patient,and that's a big shift in my life,and now I feel like 20-30% more patient,and a lot of work remains to be done.Lovely!I love that you too are feedingfrom each other.Now you will answer this questionfor each other.Bhuvan what do you think isthe biggest change in Rohit?And you can't give the same answer,anything other than patience.The best change...Could be bad.Could be bad.I think punctuality has improved toa great extent.Rohit's heart stopped becausehe did not know how you are goingto complete the sentence.punctuality to a great extenttill the top of the head.Has improved to a great extent.Like before,now it is also tough becausewhen I call him,it is very rare that he is not busyon the call.Whenever I call him,I am on waiting,because I know that he is talkingto someone somewhere.Some work is going on, anything at all.But despite that, I do not understandhow is multi-tasking everything together.So many times we have to leavesomewhere early,be it 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning,so bro gets up before me at least.Great!You made Rohit happy.I always get up early,but Bhuvan is ready and waiting outsidelet's go, let's leave.Yes, that's there.That's there.And Rohit for you?Frankly Ankur, I'll tell you,Bhuvan is the same as when we met in 2016,apart from that he has gained 10-12 kgs,and everything else is the same.He doesn't know about some numbers,he doesn't know his popularity.I am saying on his face thathe doesn't know what, where,what he has done for himself,and what will he probably do for himself.He is the same, and he is going aheadwith the same passion,I hope it happens in the future as well,but he has gained 10-12 kgs.How do you feel about that Bhuvan?Cool!Should have gained more!Were you underweight when you started?Very much.I was 53 kg at the same height.Exactly!Now I am 75 or 76, but I feel thatit is slightly lessaccording to the height,so I am aiming at touching80-82 this year.Muscle mass?Yes, because the dietI am following right now,is a random diet!My diet is so random that thereis no set time for lunch or dinner.The eggs I am having right now werefor breakfast, but now,I don't know.It's just that I've gained weight.What is your favorite dish or cuisine?My favorite dish, I can't do without eggsin the morning.Is it?Yes.Is it with the yolk?With the yolk.I've heard that it increases cholesterol.Yes, but the good cholesterol.Good cholesterol?Then I eat.And one problem is that milk isgone from my life.Oh!So milk has been replacedby tea or coffee.Have you become lactose intolerant?No, no chance, but now I drink milkwithout sugar,but one can eat many things with tea,so I drink tea only for that purpose.Milk has reduced in life.And that's it.What else do I like?I like all vegetables,I like apple gourd, zucchini,bottle gourd,bitter gourd curry is my favorite.Apart from that chicken is there,minced mutton is my favorite.Are your food habits very similaror very different?They are the same.They are quite similar, I think,there are 1-2 cuisines that I like more,and 1-2 cuisines that he likes more,so they match somewhere,but the rest is the same.Lovely!The second question that I had wasOf course, you all have workedextremely hard to reach this popularity,this fame, this success,and you have been consistent,which I think is the most important thing,and you have got a lot, a lot of glory,a lot of love, a lot of respect, status.What is the biggest thing you have hadto sacrifice that you feel bad about?Because there are some sacrifices thatyou actually feel good aboutor you don't care,but something that you can't do anymore,because Bhuvan,you and Rohit are together,and you wish that thing was there in life.Look, I've lost sleep.I've lost sleep to such an extent thatI cannot tell you.I used to sleep so much,I used to sleep so much that thereis no limit.my family used to get upset thatthey could not take Bhuvan anywhere,because I used to sleep wherever I sat,while sitting.I used to sleep so much!And many times it has happened thatI have missed Tuesday,I slept on Mondayand I woke up on Wednesday,that's how much I loved to sleep,but now it's gone.Now when I get 4-5 hours of sleep,I feel that it is an achievement for me.I don't mind that at all,because even when I get that5 hours of sleep, it good.My coke is gone from life.Coca-Cola is gone!Coca-Cola is gone from my life!And I am sad about this,but I do not regret anything,because maybe something goodhas happened to my body,and because of this,I have also started having some good food,but earlier I would have a cokewith every meal.And why did you leave?I left it because it was getting too much,I mean it became such that now,especially in lockdown,because I was binge-watching things,and that binge-watch was onlyafter 12:00 at night,and while binge-watching,I had Masala Lays, chips, Doritos,something or the other,and along with it I had Coke.So from 12:00 to 5:00 untilthat series ended, the season ended,and I watched that nonstop.I said, man, this is a mess,because then what was happening,I had random pain in the chest,or gas, pain in the back,pain here or there.So I said, what is the solution?So I said, I will try leaving cokefor a week or so.I left it.Then I didn't feel anything after that.I didn't feel like I was missing anything,so gradually, I got over itand now it's been 1.5 years.Wow!What about you, Rohit?I've left everything.For me, I think it wasa blessing in a way.For 2-3 years, I collected allthe boarding passes continuously,I collected so many boarding passes thata drawer was full of boarding passes.Then, now it seems thatin the last 1-2 years after the lockdown,there has been so much travel  that,Hello!Yeah.Bhuvan is stuck.He's back.Repeat again.Ok, I'll speak again.In the first 3-4 years of work,I collected a lot of boarding passes,so much so that a whole drawerwas filled with boarding passes.But after the lockdown,in the last 1.5 years,there has been so much travelthat I am unable to sit in one place...I guess Bhuvan has frozen again,but you can hear me?Yes, I can.Bhuvan?I'll text him.Bro, hi.Yeah, his internet is messed up,I think there's a power cut,even the WhatsApp message is not going.Got it.He will come back.He's back.Is it okay now?Yes.I don't know what's the issue.Yeah, boarding pass.Let's start.Boarding pass.Initially, I used to collecta lot of boarding passes,like it was a dream, going to the airport,taking a flight, it was like a dream.But now in the past 1 year,I am traveling so much thatthe one thing I miss the mostis I am not able to stay in one place,or spend time with my family on occasions,because life is very busy.But I also feel,like day before yesterday only,I was cribbing with my dad thatI am not able to stay in one place,every day there is a task in hand,waking up with an alarm, so he was like,Do it now, this is the right age.So since then, I have been feeling goodabout it.But the only thing is thatI am not able to stay in one placeor spend time,so I am just waiting for it.Yeah, that's a valid one.And the other end of the spectrum,there is something thatI personally realized,when you don't have money in life,actually, you don't know what to dowith that money,and you have random desireslike buying a car, house, phone,shoes, clothes,vacation, business class,blah blah blah,but the day you have money,you do all these things,but you also realize this not much to it.But the day all these things are settled,and the money still keeps flowing in,there are some things that you genuinelyenjoy about money,and you wish that other peoplerealize this about money,that all the things are there,they can be bought and all,but this one thing is just amazingabout money.What would be that one thingfor the two of you that you wishpeople would know this one thingabout money when they havea lot of money or they wishfor a lot of money?See, when you have the moneyto meet your needs, you already know that,and then you start living.Right now you are working.You wake up, go and work,come back and sleep,you are just earning money.The day you realize thatnow you have money, you start living.And how do you live?You will let go of little things.You don't fret over useless things,because you know you have somethingto fall back on.You always have a sense of comfort.You have bought a house, a car,you have bought whatevermaterialistic things you wanted,but you know that you can buy moreof those materialistic things,this is what money does.That now that physical thing,the thing you can touch,that tangible thing,you can buy it whenever you want in life,and when you know thatat any point of the hour,you can buy that thing,then I think that's whathaving money does to you.For me, contentment is thatif I do not do anything for 2-4 days,everything is ok, I'm not at loss,or I'm not getting troubled by anything.2-3 days?You will have to go to work for 2-3 daysout of compulsion?Such a tough life!Yes!That's how much I calculate.That's it!You can get a holiday for 3 days only.Lovely!What about you Rohit?For me, there are two things.I think people start working and earningby the age of 21-22-23,and I think more or lessI also started earningsome tangible money at that age.So as you said, at that time peoplehave desires to buy a house,or a new car, but first and foremost,I think once people have moneyand the biggest phenomenon in India is,people take things on EMIor keep a credit card.So I don't have any EMI on myselfso that is a great feeling that I have.So beyond anything,better than buying anything new,clear all the previous debts.And secondly, as Bhuvan said,when it happens,one thinks what's the need,I can take it later also, will take it,it's ok.So, that feeling comes for one's selfand also for others to make it happento them.Like my parents, my sister, my wife,or my friends,I feel that I can do something for them,so I would outrightly go and makethat thing happen.That feeling is very good that ifsomeone asks me and they need some thing,whether it is something materialistic,or some important investment likefor education or books or whatever.Recently, Bhuvan doesn't talk about it.A creator's house totally burned down,I think he lives in the North East,but that feeling when he said,Rohit, should I send these things for him?And he didn't have tothink about it twice.That feeling that I might empower someone.Or like my family didn't haveto think twice before taking a callthat which college to take admission in,or which city to live in,or establish themselves becauseof a job and all that,I felt that just because there wassome money in the bank,nobody had to think twiceor be worried about it.I think that feeling is really solid.Yeah.At that point, money becomesa very strong and powerful enabler,whether for the purpose of givingor for the purpose of making thingswork for you.And Bhuvan, I really like what you saidthat the biggest power of moneyis that you know that you can do itbut that doesn't mean that you do it.You just know that you can do it,and that option itself is so powerfulin life, which is brilliant.Yes, the choice that you can do itor you can't, that's a luxury.Yes.Often, some people are on that sideof the fence where they can't do it.Yes.When you are at that pointwhere you have a choice thatyou can either do it or not,then it's your call, as a humanwhat is it that you wantand what are your desires.But yes, it's a nice choice to have.Yes, it is definitely a nice choiceto have, I certainly agree.Do the two of you get timefor personal travel,to go on a vacation, enjoy the holidays?Wherever we go for work,we say let's stay for two more days.That's our idea of travel.But yes, when a project finishes,we take out time, and we have free timethat nothing will happenin the coming weeks sureshot,then both of us make plans.Fantastic!We plan.I know! Exactly!Alright, let's talk about Taaza Khabar.Bhuvan, Rohit and I were catching upbefore this call,and he shared that the original planwas to make Taaza a film,and then it ultimately became a series.How was this different from anything elsethat you have done?What was difficult, what was easy,what was the inspiration,what was the motivation?I'd love to know from the two of you.More than inspiration,more than any feeling,the strongest feeling washow will we do it.Dhindora, it was the same in Dhindora,means when you take the next step,it is always a nervous step,there is a lot of risk in it,because one, you are fightingwith your own internal battle,means an internal battle is going onthat till now what I was doingwas in my hands only,but now there are other peopleinvolved in this,so how will we pull this off?Especially Taaza Khabar,for 6-7 years I have been doing comedy,for me to go out and outand do a drama series,that was the fear whenI was reading on paper,I was getting scared while readingthat how will I do it,this is the biggest fear becausepeople have seen me doing comedyfor 7 years,they have seen my characters,what if in Vasant Gawade,they could see Titu mama, Bablu ji,or any other character?Correct.So I used to go to the set every daywith that fear,and when I used to come back from the set,I used to ask Rohit,did you see anybody today?So this fear always remains,and will remain, will remainin the future as well.As the projects go on,there will be a new type of fear,fear of something else.Now frankly, I've overcome this fearof looking similar to the characterthat I play on BB ki Vines,because maybe the approachwas like that only,that if I played 21 characters,then Vasant Gawade is my 22nd character.But I think everythingis very different becauseit is a completely new horizonfor both of us.First of all, you never knowwho you're dealing with,they're bringing their expertise,but you don't know that,you're clueless until the cameras roll,everyone's going to be in suspenseas to what it's going to look like.Although we have done full preparationin pre-production that this show shouldlook like this and of this palette.Life has taught us that we havethe right to choosethe color palette of our show.Absolutely!At first, I felt very strange.But now when I seethe final output of the show,and now the thing is,because we have worked so muchon that show,now I get a cheap thrill to seewhat it looks like on different TVs.Watch on iPad, watch on laptop,watch on Dell's laptop, watch on iPhone,watch on different TVs,watch on different devices to seehow it looks,because what we envisioned,at that time it seemed likewhy are we making it such a big hassle,but now we realise how importantit is to choose a color of your show.Yes.So, I think there are so manynew things happening,and gradually a lot of thingswill unfold on the set, but yes,I think the first step towardssomething is to convince yourselfthat ok you are capable,and you can pull it off.I think that's very importantand that came very slowly,I think while writing only.Absolutely!And its so powerful,it's almost like whenI am watching you on BB Ki Vines,and then of course, Dhindora,now as Vasant, it's like you arebecoming an actor.Now you are not Bhuvan anymore,you actually mold yourself intoa new character a new role,and that's who you areultimately becoming.I wanted to ask another question thatfor the longest time,you were the writer,you were the director,you were the actor,you were the producer,you were in an as writtenand directed and acted, etc.Now you are getting directed by people,like other people are giving you guidance,somebody else has written the script,of course, all of that involvestwo of you as well,but how different is that afterhaving done years and yearsof self-management?It is different, and it will be differentin the future when I work withsome other director as well,because the director Himank Gaurwho directed Dhindora as well,and this one too, has a different POV.He views Vasant Gawade througha different lens.The lens through which I usedto see Vasant Gawade,it's not been shot like that at all.The Vasant Gavde you seeis his imagination,and it's so beautiful,and how beautiful that imagination is,because I wasn't thinking like that,frankly, I was thinking something else.But his sensibility and understandingof the script,and the effort he has put inbringing the script to the screenas he has envisionedis completely different,because he wants to see me on screenas Vasant Gawade.And frankly,if there was another director,the show might have lookeda bit different.Correct.So it depends on each person individually.And you can give this control to someoneonly when you have full faith in them.Absolutely!And yet it's not thatI didn't trust anybody or anything,I just feel that my comfort zonewas not there that maybethey can understand what I do.Because this comfort zone comesfrom Dhindhora,Himank's first project was Dhindora.Absolutely!And Himank was as clueless in Dhindoraas us, we were like,how will we do it because VFXwas highly involved,only one person is playing 10 characters.Correct.And VFX is required in carryingthe camera from here to here,if you move the camera like this,then it costs 2-3 lakhs.We said,how will we shoot this series?But then he thought intently, he said,let's keep it simple.And he said that gave us the confidencethat we can do this shoot easily,and that shoot happened.And then we are also the same age,this is the biggest plus point.So whenever anything happens,there is any discussionwhether show-related or whatever,then we all sit down, and we say,listen, I think this ishow it should be done.Then Rohit would give his ideas.Then Himank would give his ideas.What is the goal eventually?We all should work together and progress.So when we all are on the same page,we all bring a piece of our mind,that's added to the show,and we move ahead.The same thing happened in Dhindoraand Taaza Khabar, that it is so importantto give full control to someone,and when that person isthe same age as yoursand you know that they can pull it off,this is what happens.His hands were tied during Dhindorathat I cannot move one camerafrom here to there.I asked him to stop,because we were also learning.But during Taaza Khabar,we told him to combineand apply all the cinemathat you have learned in life,and that's what he did.So I think it's all about trust.I think it's difficultto have complete trust,but both of us have been so luckythat whoever we met whether Himank,background scorers likeSaurabh and Jarvis,or the DOP Remi,like we've been really lucky.Even our writer.Something I really want to bring here,because all of us are almost the same age,and all of us are bringingare different experiences.Himank has been on MA entertainment sets,he is been on TVF sets,plus he has studied filmmaking,and of course,he has seen a lot of cinema,so he comes with his own understanding.Then our editor has edited big showson Prime videos,so he brings is own school of thought.Our DOP has studied cinematographyfrom Europe,so he comes with his ownschool of thought.Plus our writers are the most experienced,because they are the senior most for us,as they have been writing for a while.So we all do a hurdle,from assistant directors to Bhuvan,Arvind, myself our writers,we all sit down, evaluate things,and have a discussion.Despite having full control,nobody is like, this is my last say,that doesn't happen.Correct.When everybody discusses togetherfor the betterment, when we are jamming,I am sure result would be better,because ultimately,we are not making it for this one person,we are making it for the people to see,so people need to come and give commentson this.So that's how it's been happening,and I hope it continues.Brilliant!The first of many!Not even first, actually!The many of many,and that's how it goes on!Awesome!To wind this up, rapid-fire,3 questions for both of you,but you will give your own answers.So we will start with you, Rohit.First question.What is Bhuvan's most irritating habit?He doesn't eat.He will have one meal,that too at an odd hour like 3 a.m.So that is very difficult to manage,because he has to work 12 hours a day,and he has to feed himself.Exactly! I agree!Ok, second.A character from a movie which you wantBhuvan to play?And this is something already happened.Allu Arjun's characterin Ala Vaikunthapurramuloowhich is now being remade as Shehzada.Wow!I think that would have been kickassfor Bhuvan.That is awesome! Perfect!And the third,specific question for you.What do you think will bethe most expensive thingyou will ever own Rohit,beyond real estate?Beyond real estate, I think I will havethe biggest garage in 10 years from nowand the best garage.Love it!Ok, Bhuvan for you.What is Rohit's most irritating habit?Rohit's most irritating habit?He is Dr. Trehan.If I even do something like this,he will ask me to take a tablet.Bro, I don't need a tablet.He keeps giving tablets to me.And if you see his bag,medical kit is one thing,he carries a full pharmacy in his bag!Anything at all!If you have a cold, or back pain,or even piles,you will find all those tubes with him,don't know why!Love it!This is an irritating but useful habit.It's useful,but it's plugs-in for everything,so I have to sniffle quietly, otherwise,he will give me a tablet.Love it! Perfect!A character that you would wantto play, Bhuvan?A character that I would want to play?All the characters that Ranbir Kapoorhas played to date.Which is the best among themthat touched your heart?Ved, his character in the movie, Tamasha.Oh, lovely!What a pick!That's a good one!I think you will be terrific in that!Great! Good one!Okay, last question.According to you, the most expensive thingthat you would ever ownbeyond real estate?The most expensive thing I would ever ownbeyond real estate?He knows it.Oh, that would be a waste of money!Beyond real estate.It's ok, they are availablefor 500-600 crores nowadays.What do you get?Yes, what else,Rohit was showing you that only!Yes, I know that, but...It'll be possible after the next picture.Such a small thing, man!Amazing!I was thinking of an island!Island?Yes!That's what!But you said beyond real estate,so I didn't think about it.Otherwise, I want to have a small islandin my name.But beyond that?You were thinking of something,I cut you in between,something was going on in your mind.I was thinking of makinga random investment,and that investment gets blown overnight.Something happens thatit multiplies overnight.What will happen with that,you won't stop working?Yes, but then many more choiceswill come to me,now I won't have to work for 20 days.Yes, it will be more than 2 days.But yes, what can we take other than that?We cannot take anything other than that.What are your materialistic randomsplurges for both of you?We spend extravagantly on food.Which you don't eat!Which we don't eat, that's true.Means we order food,but by the time the food arrives,our hunger goes away,then that food goes here and there.But apart from that,Rohit already knows, he has forbidden me,I have a great desire to buy a Ducati,but he has forbidden me to buya two-wheeler,it will keep gathering dust, so I said,that's right.Then apart from that,I really want to get a G63,but it will burn a lot of fuel,I am worried about that,that I will not be able to go far with it,and it will just be there downstairs.But we make a promise to ourselvesafter every project,that we must buyone or two pairs of sneakers,and I think that the maximum we splurge.Not more than that!This guy has been trying forthe last 8-9 months to get me the watch.We go to the showroom,and I see the watches, I say,no, no good.He says,bro, what's good?You have to wear the watch in your hand,you tell me which watch you want.I said, there should be such a watchthat makes you feel like oh my god,I love this one, now I have to take it.So we have not been able to buy a watchfor a long time.Apart from that,we both are very fond of shoes.Shoes are sometimes like this,and I don't know how to choose shoes,so I just go by the colors,if I feel that yes,this shoe will suit me, then I take it.But other than that,absolutely zero expenses,means no expenses, our CA is upset.How much time will you take,spend some money!Awesome!On that note, all the best!May Taaza Khabar remain fresh for life,and every year, every 6 months,every 3 months,a big production keeps coming along.And with that hope, Bhuvan and Rohit,thank you so much for doingwhat you are doing.Your pairing has created a big impact,and genuinely, you have a big contributionin building the YouTube industry.So thank you for doing what you are doing.All the best and take care!Thank you, Ankur!It was so much fun!Lovely!
