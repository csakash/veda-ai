Before 2024 starts,these 90-day challengesfor your mind, body and soul.Number 1: Structured Thinking.In our mind,we have innumerable ideas.We overthink, we think too fastbut when the time comes to speak, our structure gets lost. What we want to say,we are not able to say it properly.The other person isnot able to hear it.So this 90-day challenge will bringstructured thinking in your life. How?By writing.You have to write every day.Why?Because writing is the slowest formof expression. This means thatwhen you want to speak,you can speak in English or Hindior in your own language. If you want to listen,you can listen very quickly.If you want to see,you can see very quickly.If you want to do something,you can do that too quicklybut writing is alwaysdone in a slow way.I am not talking about typing.I am talking about writingon a paper with a pen,and when you write,the innumerable ideasthat you have,you select the most important thoughtand write it on a piece of paper.That will train your mindto structure your thought process.So every day, for the next 90 days,you will write one page,and you will end whateveryou are writing about.It can be any topic.You will end it too.You can write on any topic.You can write as long as you wantor as short as you wantbut writing is important.And after writing,you will end thatthing with a sentence.This tells me that ______.Fill in the blank.So suppose you wrotesomething about your work,and you wrote downsomething about it.And then at the end, you said,this tells me that ______.Fill in the blank.With this, you will bringyour structured thinkingto a conclusion,and within 90 days,your habitwill be established.Number 2: Confident Speaking.Do you know, in a survey,people said thatthe most scary thing forthem is public speaking.In fact, more scary than dyingor deathbecause people think that theother person will judge us,laugh at us, make fun of us.Public speaking orconfident speaking,very few people can do itbut almost everyperson wants to do it.This 90-day challengewill change this.Every day, for a minute,using your phone camera,record a video,and this has to be on the same topicevery single day.You cannot change the topic.Whether it is Apple, or jobs,or Steve,or pen or paper,mind, body, any topic will dobut the same topic,you will record a oneminute video every day.Here is why it helps.When you record a video onthe same topic every day,you will start gettingbetter and better and betterwith the mistakes youmake in that same videoon that same topic.If you keep changing the topic,you will keep making mistakesbut you will never get achance to correct them.So that is why, same topic.When you record a video,then your job is to watch that video.When you watch that video,you will note down what all thingsyou did wrong according to youwhich you can improve,which you can change,which you want to experimentand do something new tomorrow.And through that,and a 90-day process,you will get a new levelof confidence in yourselfwhen it comes to public speaking.Try it out.Number 3: Eliminating Sugar Craving.Sugar is probably the mostdangerous thing in the modern world,and if you don't believe me,please do your research.You don't have to trust me on this.I am not an expert,nor am I a dietician,nor am I a nutritionist.I am certainly not medicallysubscribed or qualified,but as much as I havestudied and understood,according to me,sugar is in our life,in our body, in our mind,in our body, is in some waycausing us to suffer.And I have been overthe last several years,trying to get rid of it,but it is very difficultbecause everythingcan be sweetened up,you can eat chocolate after anything,or you can have a toffee,or you can have ice cream or dessert,or you can have Gulab Jamun or Jalebi.How do you eliminate that?A 90-day challenge.Whenever you feel like eating sugar,Whenever you feel like eating sugar,try two things.A glass of water,and not every time,but maybe once or twice a day,sugar-free chewing gum.Sugar-free chewing gum,has brought a hugedifference in my life.It's sugar-free.Yes, it has chemicals.So if you are not comfortable,then please don't use it.Use water.But if you are okay,then your mouth remains busy.So it's not just one time intake,that you eat it and it's over.It keeps your mouth occupied,and because of this, youdon't eat anything else.Number 2: It instantlyreduces your sugar craving,because it gives youthat shot of sugarthat you would want.Try it,90 days,whenever,you feel like eating sugar.Try it,90 days,wheneveryou feel like eating sugar.Try it,90 days,wheneveryou get a chance to eat sugar.Oh God!Try it for 90 days,wheneveryou feel like eating sugar,either drink water,or eat sugar-free chewing gum.Number 4: Reading.Books are beautiful becausethrough a book,you can learn from someone's whole life,their experiences,their learning,their mistakes,their success.And that is incredibly powerful,powerful, not plowerful,because you can standon their shouldersand get even higher.That's why I love books,but reading bookshas become a difficult task.People's attention span has reduced,books are getting very boring,and that's why you feel,how to get into thehabit of reading books?A 90-day challenge.Every day,just 10 minutes,you have to read a book.You don't have to finish the book,you don't have to read those bookswhich you feel you should read.You can pick up anybook from your mindas long as it is a book.It can't be a magazine,it can't be an online article,it has to be a book,that you either readin your physical handsor on a Kindle,and that 10 minute interval,has to be done every day,for 90 days.You don't have to share thename of the book with anyone.You don't have to share that youare reading the book with anyone,You don't have to share thereview of that book with anyone.You don't have to tell anyonethat you are reading a book.You will only read itfor the joy of reading.And if you don't like that book,if you don't find that entertaining,if you don't find that interesting,close that bookand pick up another book.You don't have to commit yourselfto completing a book.You only have tomake one commitmentfor this 90 day challenge.You have to read a bookfor 10 minutes every day.That's it.I guaranteeafter 90 days,if you do this every day,you will learn to read books.Number 5: Meditation.Meditation has become soimportant in today's world,because our attentionis spread everywhere.There is noise everywhere,and there is a kindof silence everywhere.And in the middle ofthis noise and silence,our mind is scattered.We are not able to focus on anything,we are never able tolive in the present.Either we keep thinkingabout the past,or we keep worryingabout the future.Meditation allows you,to be in the moment,but it is very difficult.Very difficult.I have recently broken mymeditation record of 1,500 days.This is my personal record,and I am so proudthat for the past 5 years,I have beenevery day,without a single miss, I have been meditating.Only for 30 minutes a day,but you don't haveto do for 30 minutes.For this 90 day challenge,you have to meditateevery day for 10 minutes.No one needs to listen.There is no need to do anything.You just have to listen to a voice,you choose that voice.There is only one criteriathat in that voice or sound,there should not be a human voice.It can be the voice of animals,it can be the voice of rain,it can be the voice of water,it can be the voice of a storm,it can be any other voice,but you have to just listen to that.For 10 minutes,close your eyes,take a breath,and as much as you canfocus on your breath,try to give it.Take a deep breath in,and a deep breath out,and do it for just 10 minutesevery day for 90 days.I have done it for 1,500 days,and I can guarantee youthat if you do this90-day challenge,you will find such peacein those 10 minutesthat you will get addicted to it,and you would want togo back to that zoneevery day.Then increase it to 20 minutes or 30 minutes,and so on,as much as you want.first,But first,90 days,in 10 minutes of meditation,every day.Number 6:The most interesting challenge.Getting rejected.Often, if I ask people,that friend,why are you getting scared?The biggest reason is,rejection.Every person is scared of rejection.They are scared thatpeople will refuse them,people will not say things to them,people will reject them,people will laugh at them,people will scold them,and we do not knowhow to deal with that.To fix this,this 90-day challenge.Every day,do somethingin which you will get rejected.Guaranteed rejection,but with just one difference.That the cost of that rejectionis not big enough for you.Let me give you an example.You go to the mall one dayand ask someone for 500 rupees.It's quite possiblethat 99% chance thatyou will get rejected,but I want you toexperience that rejection.The things that happen,your ears turn red,you start sweating,your heartbeats change,your legs start shaking,you don't know how theother person will react,that's what I want you to feelevery day.The next day, whenyou go to the office,in the elevator,look into someone's eyes,and wish them good morning.It's quite possiblethat the person in front of youmay not even accept you,may not even acknowledge you.I want you to feel that rejection.This is not a sadistic challenge.This is not that I am takingyou through a painful pathso that I feel happy.The reason iswhen you do something likethis every day for 90 daysin which you have been rejected,you will build what iscalled the rejection muscle,and this muscleis very important for youto face any big rejection.It doesn't mean that you knowthat you will be rejected.It means that you areready for any rejection.You are ready for it.You are willing to embrace itif it comes your way.This challenge will change your life.Number 7:The way I live my life. Resist the obvious.We will discuss this a little.Suppose you are investingin the stock market.You buy a stock,any stock,HDFC, Reliance, SBI,ICICI, TCS,any of these companies,I am just taking the names.You have the same informationwhich everyone has.You don't have anyspecial information.You don't know anyone,you have not receivedany special information,you have not receivedany insider information.You are investing on the basis,on which the world is investing.So the company's financials,their revenue growthprofit growth,corporate structure,market share,whatever all the metrics are.Science tells usthat your returnwill be exactly equal toeverybody else's return.In other words,if you do somethingbasis the informationwhich everyone knows,then your outcome is the samewhich will be of everyone.This is the principle of life.This is the principle of life.Now let's extend this.That if youLet's extend this.If you want differentresults from others,then you will haveto do somethingwhich not everyone is doing.That's the only wayto get different results,and note that I am saying different,not betterbecause it is not necessarythat if you do somethingwhich not everyone is doing,then it will be better.No!It will be just different.So, resisting the obvious tells youthat whatever is obvious,which the whole world will do,try to resist it.Stop once anddon't take the pathwhich every person will take,but think of the pathwhich very few people will take,if anyone even takes it.Here's an example.In 2004,I was doing my PhD in the US.I was in a good university,I was on 100% scholarship,I was doing the same programwhich I wanted to do.I was on the first number in the class.I was doing that courseand program very well,butI was not happy.Now, ask yourself this question.If there is a studentwho is studying in the US,studying in a good university,is on 100% scholarship,is on top of the class,is doing the programwhich he wanted to do,and is doing well in that programbut he's not happy in that program,what are they mostlikely going to do?And 99% of the peoplewould have continuedwith that course.I knewthat if I keepdoing that course,then my outcome will be the samewhich every person will havewho has continued that course,and if I needed a different result,I will have to think something else.And what I thought of isthat I will drop out of this courseand start my life again.Here I am.And that doesn't meanthat decision was right.Don't make this mistake.That decision was just different,and I am herebecause I gave myselfthat opportunityof a different outcome.I resisted the obvious,which is what youhave to do as well.For the next 90 days,whenever you have a decision,just try to thinkthat in this circumstance,what decision will every person take?And it is not necessarythat you are rejectingthat decision.All I want you todo for 90 daysis that decision or option,keeping it in mind,think of some other option.An option that you knowvery few people will come up with.With this, you will train your mind.So when you feelafter listening to or seeing someone,that how does he think like this?How does he think so differently?It's because of this training.It's because for years,they have trained themselvesto resist the obvious.Your mind is like other people,but their mind ison a different path,and that sets them upfor different opportunities.Number 8:The desire of the whole world.Wake up on time.It's not necessary to wake up early,but we want to wake up on time.So suppose you wakeup at 8 a.m. today,and you want to wake up at 6 a.m.So what do most people do?They set an alarm for 6 a.m.Now if you set an alarm for6 a.m. for the first time,then you will wake up.You will wake up for a day,you will wake up for two days,three, maybe a week,but after that, the bodywill start screaming."Sleep.""Press snooze.""It's 6 o'clock. There is a lot of time.What will you do after waking up?"And slowly, with time,like a rebound,you will reach back to 8 o'clock.That's the wrong way of doing it.There is another way.The 90-day challenge.The 90-day challengearound waking up on timeis the following.If you wake up at 8,If you wake up at 8 a.m. today,then you will set the alarmfor 7:50 a.m. the next day.Just less than 10 minutes.You will do that for three weeks.For 21 days,you will wake up at 7:50 a.m.through that alarm.Slowly, your body willstart waking up on its ownbecause it's just a10-minute interval.Slowly, your body willstart waking up on its ownbecause it's just a10-minute interval.So it's not a big thing,it's not a big shock.When you will becomfortable with 7:50 a.m.,which will be approximately 3 weeks,then you will set thealarm for 7:40 a.m.Then you will set thealarm for 7:30 a.m.,and what will happen isover the course of 90 days,which is approximately 12 weeks,you will use this 3-week cycle,you would have reducedyour waking up time by 40 minutes,and those 40 minuteswould have enteredyour ritual in a way,like a root.It will be very hardfor you to go backto that 8 a.m. slot,because your body wouldhave got used to 7:20 a.m.Do that for another time.Do that for another 3-week cycletill you reach your desired spot.I wake up every daybetween 4:30-5 a.m.I used to wake up between7-7:30 a.m. at one point.To move from 7-7:30 a.m.to 4-4.30 a.m.took me three and a half years.But today, if I sleep at 9 p.m.,which I do every day,or I sleep at 11 p.m. or 12 a.m.,which sometimes happens,if there is a flight orsomething late night,I get up between 4.30-5 a.m.without a clock,without an alarm,without anybody waking me upbecause the body is set.90-day challengeto wake up on time.Number 9:It's a very interesting challenge.Overthinking.Every human is avictim of overthinking.Not a victim, but a prey, my friend.A prey,and by prey, I mean,we cannot even stop our mindto go into all thedirections that it goes into.Like there is no control.We don't even knowwhere we start fromand where we end up.The difference between anoverthinker and a thinkeris a very subtle onebut an important one.Let me explain.You leave your house every dayto go to office, college, school,or anywhere,and there is a possibilitythat you may have an accident.Is there a possibility or not?There is a possibility.Then why do you leave the house?There is a possibility.There is a possibilitythat a car, truck, busmay hit youand you may get hurt.Then why do you leave?I'll tell you why.You leave becausedespite the possibility,there is a small thing in your mindthat the probability ofthis happening is very low.So this thing can happen,but the probability ofit happening is very low.And that stops the overthinking.Now, extend that.We overthink becauseeverything is possible in our mind,everything can happen,but our mindmakes us an overthinkerwith one thing.That all those thingsthat are possible,to what extentare they possible?What is the probabilityof all the possibilitiesin our head?So yes, you can lose your job.Yes, your girlfriend orboyfriend can leave you.Yes, your parents can fall ill.Yes, your entiremoney can be wasted.Yes, your phone can fall.Yes, you can get lostin the bus or fall.Whatever the case may be,everything is possible.But which of thesethings are probable?Which are the thingsthat have a difference inpossibility and probability?That is what you haveto feed your mindbecause as soon as our mindgets a probabilitywith a possibility,our mind calms downand it stops overthinking.So, a 90-day challenge.90-day challenge is whenever youfind your mind overthinking,just ask yourselfwhat is the probabilityof this happening?And write down that numberphysically on a piece of paper.Instantly, your mind will stopbecause it would recognizethat what I wasthinking is possible,the probability of ithappening is very low.And finally,Number 10:The most important challenge of all.Procrastination.Pro-pro-crastination.Pro-crastination.Pro-crastination.It's crass, not gas.When I say it often,I say pro-castination,which is wrong.Pro-cras-tination.It meanswhatever you have to do today,you will do it tomorrow.And tomorrow's work will bedone the day after tomorrow,and it will continue.And to do this,there is a very interesting90-day challenge.Let's start with an example.Do it with me.If I say thatyou have to clap every second,then clap.Let's do that.Okay. Do it with me.1, 2, 3, go.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.Very good.Now, clap every 3 seconds.Okay?It's a little difficult.Let's try and do it.1, 2, 3, go.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.Okay, very good.Now, clap every 7 seconds.Okay. Let's see.1, 2, 3, go.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.And I say,clap every 33 seconds.Do you know what happened?The speed at which you will count,the speed at which I will count,at what speed someoneelse will count,it's different.At 33, I don't know,different claps will be being made.Someone is clapping here,someone is at 33,someone is at 37,someone is at 40.It's completely out of syncbut at 1 second interval,every personwill be clapping atalmost the same rhythm.What did we do?We broke down a taskinto smaller predictable tasks.A big task of 33 seconds,we broke it into smaller and smaller33 tasks of 1 second each,and because it was atask of just 1 second,we got predictability,we got control.We knew that what we were doingwas quite right.That is how you beatprocrastination.So, 90-day challenge.For the next 90 days,whatever task comesin front of youwhich you don't want to do,or are trying to procrastinate,or have already done,break down that taskinto 1-second tasks.Such a small onewhich cannot be broken downfurther by anyone else,and just finish that task.Just that task,and then stop.Just stop.You will recognizethat slowly, slowly, slowly,you have reached your destination.You will be shocked and surprisedat how breaking down a big taskinto smaller tasksand making it predictablemakes you not procrastinate themat any point of time.This 90-day challengecan change your life.In 2024,almost 3 months are left.To start 2024,Before 2024 begins,almost 3 months are leftwhich means that these challenges,for 90 days,which means that all these challenges,the 90-day challenges,you can finishthem before 2024 begins,which meansyou can start 2024as the best year possible for yousetting you up for success.Which of these challengeswill you use for yourself?Let me know in the comment section.All the best.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off.Thank you.
