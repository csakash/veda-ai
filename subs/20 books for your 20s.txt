I can look them in the eyeand know what this boy is thinking. But about women,about girls, about the opposite gender,I have no idea.I don't know how they think. I don't know how the behave.I don't know why theysay the things they do, or do the things they do.This book was a reallyinteresting introduction.In fact, it was interesting becausejust like I said,I started reading itat the age of 22 or 23when I was in the US,and this waswhen I was alreadyin a relationship.
