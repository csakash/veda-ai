Will you be my study guide and mentor?âEnter.If you are a student,then ChatGPT can beyour best friend.In fact, I would saythat ChatGPT can beyour best teacher. In this video,I will show you 5 waysthrough which youcan use ChatGPT to ace your examinations, conquer entrance exams, and also act asa friendly guide and mentorin that journey.Number 1: Asking questions.A lot of questionswhich are in our mindbut we never got theopportunity to ask them,or our teacher dismissedthose questions,or we couldn'tunderstand through books,ChatGPT could easily solvethat entire problem for us.For example, For example, you ask GPT, âCan you explain photosynthesis?â,which is a fundamentalscience concept. A lot of teachers have taught itbut ChatGPT tries toexplain it simply. It gives usa step-by-step breakdownof photosynthesis whereabsorption of light takes place.So, sunlight is absorbed first.That light is converted.That light is converted.Water from roots is absorbed.Then, formation ofsomething calledATP takes place.Then, carbon dioxide uptake takes place.Then, a Calvin cycle takes place, and then, glucose is produced which the parents, sorry, not parents, the plants ultimately need. Parents also need it. Glucon-D Anyway, and this is the complex process of photosynthesis simplified for youthrough ChatGPT.Let's ask more questions.âCan you explainthe fundamentalsof capitalismin 100 words?âAnd in just 100 words, a summarised form of capitalism is here in front of you using ChatGPT. âCan you explain the concept  of gravitational waves?ââWhat is the significance of French Revolution?ââTell me about the history of Gupta Empire.ââExplain the basics of machine learning.ââSummarise the plot ofPride and Prejudice.ââShare the 20 most important dates in India's history.â Many more questions like these,whichever questionsare in your mind, you can ask ChatGPT and they will give you an answer.Step number 2:Using ChatGPT as homework help.An important thing toknow in this step isthat homework help cannotbecome your crutch.GPT can tell you howto solve your homework,how to think about it,but if you use it tosolve your homework, then as a student,you will never beable to move forward. So, what you want to do isasking the question and then asking for a directionof how to go about solving it. For example, âCan you provide some ideas for an essay on climate change?âor âHow do I structurea research paper?â or you have written a paragraph, you have done your homework, and you want ChatGPT to checkyour grammar. So, âCan you check my grammar in this paragraph?âor our favourite,a math problem.âI am stuck on this math problem. Can you please help?âChatGPT will always try togive you the right direction. It will also tell you,âIn my prediction,this is right,but do not blindly trust me.Trust your own judgementand move forward.âThis is what a true friend,a true guide, a true mentorwill do to youif they are helpingyou in your studies.Number 3:Practicing any new skill.Let's say you have toprepare for a job interview. So, you will ask ChatGPT,âGPT, can we prepare for a mock job interview?âor you want to learnnegotiation strategiesand you will ask GPT,and you will ask GPT,âLet's role play anegotiation situation.â or you are learning coding.You want to practice coding and you will ask GPT, âWhy don't you give me a simplePython problem to solve.âIn fact, I made a video on how you can use ChatGPT to improve your English. A step-by-step guidewhere you can use ChatGPTto learn not just English but any other language or any other skillwhere it would provide you a complete schedule.It will tell you whatyou have to do every day,it will teach you howyou have to practice,and all of thisthrough an interfacewhich you control.Let's practice writing. âGive me a creativewriting prompt.â And GPT would give you that too.Number 4: Learning about new topics.In order to learn any new topic,we need to gathera lot of data frommultiple sourcesand understand it.GPT makes it easy for us.You just have to ask a question and that will be the startof a whole new skill that will open up for you.âHey GPT,give me an overview of cryptocurrency.â or âHey GPT, explain the conceptof dark matter.âor âHey GPT,give me an overview of the renewable energy sector in India.âor âHey GPT, what is bioinformatics?âAny question, any curiosity, any possible topic,GPT will surely providean answer for you,and that will be the start of you as a student.And then finally, number 5:Preparing for examinations.Any exam that you want to conquer, whether it is CBSE, NEET,JEE, UPSC, CA, or anything else,GPT is your true friendand guide if you use it properly. âHey GPT,I am in my class 12th preparingpreparing for myIIT-JEE exams.I am weak in Physicsand need your help.Can youprepare a 30-day plan for me to revise all the physics concepts that I need to know to make sure I get through the IITJEEexam.âGPT then makes acomplete plan for you.Week 1:You will focus onmechanics and optics.Week 2: Thermodynamicsand electromagnetism.Week 3: You wouldcontinue electromagnetism and start modern physics.Week 4:Wave oscillations and gravitation. Every single week,every single day is planned.Day 1: You wouldstudy the concepts.Day 2: You wouldsolve basic problems.Day 3: You wouldreview the same topic.Day 4: You would start solvingadvanced level problems.Day 5: You will practiceprevious year papers of IIT-JEE.Day 6: You would take a break.Day 7: You would consolidateyour learning and clarifyany doubts you have.Now, you can get into it. So, week 1, in mechanics,every single thing itwants to teach you, you would plan for it as well.So, âTell meeverything that I needto cover in the section mechanics,which is kinematics,laws of motion, work, energy and power.â And when you ask,it will tell youeverythingin every subject. What to study in kinematics?What to study in laws of motion?What to study in work,energy and power?Every single book,study resources,our favourite âConcepts of Physicsâ by H.C. Verma,âFundamentals of Physicsâby Resnick-Halliday, whichoh my god, we havestudied so much. Conceptual understanding,practice problems, numerical applications, every single thing. Letâs use thisfor something bigger.âI am preparing for my UPSCexams this yearand strugglingwith mypolitical sciencesection.Can youprepare a 30-day revision plan forpolitical science for my UPSC?â And that's it.Every day,every single dayâs plan, GPT has created for you.Day 1: Introduce,scope, methods.Day 2: Theories of stateand power.Day 3: Approaches to political science: Normative,empirical and behavioural. Day 4:Comparative politics.Day 5: Same as day 4 but it has forms of government and constitutions. Then, political parties,political development, modernisation. All of that is coveredand there is a step-by-step plan.You can get into every day and ask it specifically, âThis day,you have told me to studytheories of state and power, what do I need to study in it? From where do I study? How much do I need to study? Why should I study it?â And GPT will give you those answers.Not just this,In fact, a lot of studentswant to appear for mock exams, but taking mock exams is difficult,expensive,not possible,the same thing keeps repeating.GPT can take your mocks.So, you can actually ask, âCan you quiz meon on the Indian Independencemovement?âAnd GPT willstart asking questions.âWho was the leader ofthe Indian National Congressduring the IndianIndependence movement?â âIn which year didMahatma Gandhi launchthe salt march?âAnd all of these questions.You can answer these questions.GPT will tell you whether youranswers were right or not.In fact, if you feel that itâs too easy and you'll say,âHarder questions please.â And GPT will be like,âNo problem, my friend.Let's ask moredifficult questions.â âWho was the leader of the Ghadar Party, an organisationformed by Indian immigrants in the United States and Canada to advocate for India's Independence?â And so on. A lot of questions,one after another, and you can keep going up, up, up in terms of howyou want to assess yourselfthrough these mocks.âLet's practice some calculus problems.ââCan you explain this conceptI read in my biology book?ââCan you help me revise formy physics exam on optics?ââLet's practice somedifferential questionsthat are asked at the IIT-JEE.ââCan you explainthe digestive systemfor my NEETentrance examination?â In these 5 ways, ChatGPT,at your service,and you can conquer anything.But along with all this,one thing that every studentmay, or certainly does have, at the back of their minds,but they ignore it as well. And that is motivation, that is inspiration, that is confidencewhich they often needbecause there are momentsof self-doubt, moments of losing your sanity.And surprisingly,GPT can help you here as well.âHey GPT, can you provide some motivational quotes?ââHey GPT, how can I keep trackof my study progress?ââHey GPT, can you provide tipsfor remaining focusedwhen I am studying?â âHey GPT,can you help create a study schedule for me?âAnd GPTis at your service. Through the power of artificial intelligence, technology,as a student,with a phone,with an internet connection,you can tap resourcesin the entire world,and GPT is there to help you with that.
