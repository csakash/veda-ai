It will be in HD only,it cannot be 4K because apparently it is notsupported by my display. So my display is cheap,donât scold me, but that is what Iâm going to do, 1080.Ok, letâs start recording.3 2 1 goFirst of all, not surprisingly, time management.I have spoken a lot about time management.I have my own course also,but time management is themost important soft skill in life.I am repeating it.Time management is the most importantsoft skill in life, because if you cannot controlyour time then you will not be able tocontrol anything in your life.If you do not have your time,there you will neither get an opportunityto do anything, nor the intent to do itnor even the motivation for it.This course on Udemy ontime management is a great course.More than 18000 students have already taken it.It is a cheap course, but in 2 hours it willset you up for the fundamentalsyou need to know about time management.Next, change management.In the last two years, if there is somethingwe've got to know very clearly,it is that the world will keep changing,and it will change in such a waythat we cannot plan for it.So the only thing that you can do is tomanage the change that is happening.You can make as many business plansas you can, make as many planningon excel sheets as you can,make as many schedules as you can,it will change come what may.But when the change happens inyour world, in your life, in your work,then how do you manage that change,and how do you distribute that changeamongst your team, your colleagues,that is an important andnecessary soft skill in life.Third, clearly, communication skills.There is no order, so I am not givingany rank 1, rank 2.So, communication skills are necessaryand absolutely critical for your success.Whatever you may know,if you cannot communicate, it is useless.If you can not present your ideas,if you cannot listen to other people's feedback,if you cannot implement themproperly and present it back,then everything is useless,and that is why communication is thebedrock of soft skills, on whose foundation,every other soft skill is built upon.There is a very important aspect incommunication skills, which is storytelling.You must have observed that in my videos,I often weave a story somewhere or the other,because that is the way we got to learnand understand the world.When we were kids, our parents,grandparents used to tell us stories,and through those stories,we tried to understand the world.We did not learn Hindi and English alphabetand counting first, we listened to stories first,so that kid still exists in our mind somewhere,who tries to understand and listen to stories only,and whenever we get to hear a story,we get excited. How can you weavestories in your communication,how you can merge them seamlessly,will be taught to you by this course on storytelling.Next, charisma.Close your eyes, think about all the speakersand leaders who have impressed you.You like whatever they say.It could be anyone, a historical figure,a present leader, and one thing thatbinds all of them is something called charisma.Something which you cannot quantifybut you can absolutely feel it.There is an aura on their face,there is a foundational effect in their voice,their expressions are so magneticthat you feel like listening to them all the time,whatever they may be saying,and that is such an important ingredientfor you to hook whosoever you arespeaking to, or to build any connectionor relationship. That is why charisma issuch a critical soft skill before you turn 30,for you to master.Next, how to find a job?How to use networks?How to present yourself?This course, which is
The Complete Resume LinkedIn course.It seems like a hard skill but there aremany softer aspects embedded in it,because whenever we write a resume,we can make it in two ways.One is the approach through hard skills. It is,I have done this, I have studied this,I have succeeded here, that's it!But there is another softer aspect,which is about connecting the jobthat I am applying for with my resume.What are the things that I've done inlife that are applicable to this job?How can I present them?How can I tell its story?How can I express its emotion?All of that is not a robotic thing,it is something that only comes withexperience and this one thing,if you are going to have a 40-50 year career,is critical for your success.Recently, though it has been always there,personal branding has become very important,and it seems that personal branding means,to create content on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter,create a big following, and because of thatpeople will appreciate you, applaud you,but according to me, personal brandingis there in everybody's life.You are also a personal brand.The only difference is that is only afew people can feel your personal brand,but it is still there.When you step into a room,give your presentation, meet your boss,go for an interview, your personal brandcan be observed, and that is importantbecause if you can ownand control that personal brand,then how do people emote with you,how do they interact with you,how do they receive you,you start taking control of that.WritingWriting is something I am very fond of.And it is tragic that many people haveforgotten how to write because we only type,and that too in broken English,where awesome is awsum,so according to me, writing wellis a very very important soft skill,because if you can write well,you can gather your thoughtsand structure them,you can present them well,you get so much clarity in your mind aboutwhat you want to speak and why.So before making any video, I write my notes,and these notes help me in gettingthe clarity of knowing what to speak,when to speak, and in which flow to speak.I speak impromptu because that hascome through experience, but that isbeside the point. If I will not write thenI will be all over the place,I won't be able to bring any structurein my videos, which you think comes naturally,but it is a conscious thought onlyaccomplished through writing.The power of deep listening.If you want to be a good leader,if you want to be a good relationship owner,then you will have to learnthe skill of deep listening.Because till the time you don't listento a person and I don't understandthe purpose of listening, not to answerbut to understand.You are listening to a person to understandwhat they are saying, not to just replyto whatever you are listening to.And when you get to that point,people love you.They love you because, for the first time,they feel that somebody is listening to them,something which is very rare in theworld nowadays, and if you have this soft skill,you are God!Influencing and persuading.You have to influence someone atevery point in your life, whether it isinfluencing the vegetable vendorwhile buying vegetables, if you couldget some more free coriander and chilies,or trying to negotiate, there is aseparate course on negotiationabout which I will tell you,or you are trying to influence your manager,your team members to follow a certain path,you are trying to influence your partneror your spouse to go for a certain vacation,anything at all. If you learn the skillof Influencing and Persuasion,then you have a way of getting yourpoint across in a manner that peopledo not feel that you are imposingyour choices on them.Emotional intelligence at work.Everything boils down to emotions.People work in a company,people are not a data point on anexcel sheet, people are humans,they have emotions, they have feelings.Sometimes they are happy sometimesthey are sad, sometimes they areextremely motivated, sometimes they are not,and it is very important for you tounderstand and recognize these emotions,especially as a leader, equally importantas a colleague, because till the timeyou do not have the emotional intelligenceto understand others emotions,you will not be able to understandyour own emotions, and everythingwill just become robotic,and at some point of time,it will stop working.It is a new world now, everythingis done remotely because of covid,it is not going to go back, hybrid hasbecome a truth, you will never workfrom office for 5-6 days in a week.You will work in a hybrid modeand because of that if you do not knowhow to manage remote teams?How to bind them?How to keep them motivated?How do you get work done from them?How not to overpower them?You will be missing a major chunk ofthe biggest transformation that hashappened in the last 20 yearsin the workplace.Critical thinking.Critical thinking is very importantbecause we are often given some work,and we take that work like donkeys,I am not calling you a donkey butin a way I am, so we take up that worklike donkeys and start working on it.We never take a pause and think,why is that work assigned to us?What is the purpose?What is the objective?What will it do?And we very rarely try and stopand think about it critically.Critical doesn't mean find faults in it.Critical thinking means that you areputting pressure on yourself,for you to think deeply about somethingthat you have been asked to do,and that you have to solve for.It is a very very valuable soft skill.Creativity, design thinking, and innovation.I don't know how many of you haveheard about design thinking,but a process, a thinking processthat starts with the consumers.Design and creativity, when you givea solution for any problem, it couldbe a direct solution, or it could bea creative solution as well.Creative Solutions are very different.I'll give you a simple example.You are standing in front of a liftand this lift is very slow. So you pressednumber 8, and the lift is on its way,you are getting frustrated becauseevery day you have to wait forthe lift to go on the 8th floor,and you lose 10-15 minutes.Now if you are given this problem,that you must solve this problem,many people are getting frustratedand criticizing us,then your natural default would be,increase the speed of the lift.That is what is called straight-line thinking.Creative Thinking or design thinkingwould be, what is the problemthat needs to be solved?Not the speed of the lift but thewaiting period that people have for that lift.When they are waiting,they don't have anything to do.Now, suddenly if you give them something,whether there is a screen which isshowing some nice ads,or some nice movies, or some nice songs;or maybe there is some nice musicplaying in the background; or you cangive something to engage them,something which makes them feelthat their waiting period is actually nota waiting period or not that long.That is the way you apply design thinkingto solve a problem, that is notnecessarily driven by just that one solution,which everybody can think of instantly.Presenting with confidencePresentations happen in offices ona regular basis, but how to present them?How to present them confidently?What is confidence all about?How to acquire and build confidence?This course will teach you everythingand it will allow you to practice as well.Brilliant soft skill to have anda necessary soft skill to have.Ask better questions andbuild better relationships.I love questions!Because when we ask good andrelevant questions we take a step forward.You get answers only when you ask questions but....If you are able to ask the right questions,then the answers will gradually takeyou to new questions, which willelevate you to a new height, a new direction.If you are a good question seekerthen you will actually get to betterand better solutions and better problems.Negotiations secrets.I spoke about it, negotiator is so important.Negotiation for salary,negotiation for promotion,negotiations for a new opportunity,all of those things are critical to success,and if you are a good negotiatorthen this course will tell you to aboutthe basics of negotiation,and which techniques can you use,which are proven to workand then you can get startedon a wonderful negotiating experience.Assertiveness.Assertiveness means a way in whichyou can present your thoughts,your point of view, in a very clearand confident manner to the otherteam or an individual, but it doesn'tcome across as arrogance or rude,because there is a very fine line.I will not do this, is rude.But assertiveness will twist this to somethingwhich is not rude but confident.Keeping your self-respect intact andwithout being egoistic, you are ableto express your point of view.Write better emails.Emails are not going anywhere.If you do not know how to write good emails,then you do not know a veryimportant soft skill in life.I love cold emails.You must have heard, a lot of timesso many opportunities get createdbecause you write an email to aperson who doesn't know you,but if you do a good job,it can open up a whole new worldof opportunities for you.Giving and receiving feedback.Feedback is very important for growth.Giving feedback, so that you can tellthe person where they are going wrongand how they can improve.And taking feedback, so that you canunderstand how you can improve,and what are the flaws that youneed to work upon.This is so so so critical, and it is a skillto acquire which every individualdoesn't know, but if you learn it,it will set you up for life.Be a great mentor.All the courses, all the soft skills arenow getting to a next level. From anindividual contributor, they are nowprogressing to the of next level ofbeing a leader, a manager.It is a very important skill set to bea mentor, because eventually friends,whatever you may be doing, you willhave to manage people, and if that happens,then you have no choice but to becomea good mentor, you have no choicebut to become a good leader,and this is the first step for you to get there.Interview training.How to judge people during an interview.This is not about giving interviewsbut taking interviews.How do you judge a personby asking good questions,you can judge their skills,you can get to know how that person is,and also get to know if they willmake a good team member.All of this is so so important forbeing an effective leader.Inspiration leadership skills.Being a leader is a verypowerful position of responsibility whereso many people look up to you,trying to draw inspiration from you,trying to emulate you,trying to become you,and if you are not able to inspire them,then you will fail as a leader,and this course will set you upfor that foundation.Team facilitation.How do you facilitate your team?How do you get to know there skills,qualities, and strengths?How are you able to bifurcate and distributethe work amongst them?How do you get to know eachand every individual, and throughthat make a well-fledged capable team?All of this in this course.Become a master at conflict management.If you find yourself in a conflict,then you know how hard is it to managethat because when two peopleare arguing intellectually, of course,there is no physical tussle in offices,hopefully, it's not there,but there is an intellectual tussle,there is a debate happening,maybe it has become rude,and at that point of time as their manager,even as a colleague, how to managethat conflict is a skill.It is a skill that we are not taughtin school and college.It is a skill that we will only learnthe hard way in life, and this coursecan be a great shortcut to learn that.Effective delegation.You cannot do all the work yourself.You will have to give that work tosomebody else at some point,and trust them that they will dothat work properly.This is the way that you understandthe power of delegation.A great skill to have, a necessary skill to have.If you have recently become a manager then,the basics and more of becoming a great leader.A brilliant course which will introduceyou to how to think about your roleas a new leader, as a new manager.Based on that,Management skills, new managertraining in essential skills.This is a brilliant course which isa combination of soft skills and hard skills,which will tell you over 11 hoursabout the minute details that youmust know, for you to to establishyourself as a good leader,as an effective leader,and be trusted by your team.Team leadership, team management skills.All these different courses specificallyon just becoming an team leader,becoming a team manager.Very very very important skill set of your life.You may be in any role, you may bedoing anything, if you are early in your career,and you will start honing yourself inmanagerial and leadership skills,you will set yourself up for a far fastercareer progression than most others.And finally, a course which in 30 hours,will boil down all these soft skills tocome together to 11 essential soft skills.A course that combines everythingand gives you a basic summaryand foundation for you to understandhow important are soft skills,how critical they are in your career,and how you can develop them.Friends, all these courses will helpyou to understand and appreciatethe power of soft skills.Unfortunately, there is no emphasison soft skills in our schools and colleges.Even if it is there then it is a very basic level.But over time we learn all the soft skillson the job, because of which we make manymistakes, because of which we findourselves in a position where we arereprimanded, we get penalizedfor making wrong decisions,taking wrong actions, and I don't wantyou to be in that position ever,which is why through this videoand through the introduction of these soft skills,I want to give you a forewarning in a way,that before you turn 30, if you getmastery on all these soft skills,you will be a rockstar!Because I am convinced that youhave the hard skills to accomplishand to succeed, but the soft skillswhich we have not been taught properly,are going to be the only missingchink in your armor.
