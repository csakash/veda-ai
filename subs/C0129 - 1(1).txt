Ok.letâs get started.In this video I'll share with you 13 waysto save money smartly.Friends, who doesn't like to save money?So, in this video,Iâll share with you 13 such hacksthrough which you can save money smartly.Plus, a bonus hack, right in the end.I have used these hacks in my life,am sure, will work in your life too.And letâs get started on that.Hack No. 1. Automate your savings.Research has proved that wheneveryou have money,in your bank account or in your hand,you tend to spend it.So, if you want to save money,and want to invest it.Then you have to automatethose investments. How?Examples, ask the employer to deduct EPFwhich is the employees provident fund,automatically from your salary,Create SIPs,so as soon as the money comes in,immediately your EMI will go towardsyour monthly investment,Whenever your entire salary arrives,Open one more bank accountand make an auto debit there.So, that your investment amountgets paid from your main bank account.And whatever remains,you'll run your whole month in that.Whatever it takes for you to automate it,because if you cling on to motivation,then you may not be able to save money.Why to save? To invest.Hack No. 2. Do you keep fast?Maybe kept by mom and dad,you might have kept kept it as well.Letâs abstain from money.One day in a month,In a week, every fortnight,you will try a non-spending day.On that day, you will not spendon anything anywhere.Now, why does this work?One is, discipline comes in.You get to understand that,not everything in lifeis available just by spending moneyTwo, more importantly,you have to live life that day, right?So, you have to spend somewhere.So, what will happen is,if you're not permitted to spend money,because youâre abstaining,then you will have to plan.You have to think in advance, on this day,at this point, Iâll face expenses,so how should I manage that?And that discipline will train you,how to treat your money with respect.Hack No. 3.Use UPI Instead of credit cards.There are three reasons,No. 1, this money is yours,the money that the credit card gives you,is not yours. It is a debt.So, we think, this money is ours,but we have to ultimately pay it.And that is not a smart way to do it.Second, whenever you use a credit card,a surcharge is charged at many places.about 1%, 2%, even 3% sometimes.Why would you want to pay that money,when UPI is absolutely free.No. 3, as I said,UPI is your own money,comes out of your bank account,so, if you do not have money,you will not spend.And that will make you disciplinedabout your money.Hack No. 4. Use credit cards,but only when you have 100% money.Actually using a credit cardis not a bad thing,Three reasons why cardsare actually a good thing.No. 1, whenever you use a credit card,you pay that amount after 30-45 days.Means, someone is legallygiving you a month's interest-free loan.If your credit card spend is too high,by putting the same amountin a debt mutual fund,you can earn a little interestit would not be much.But itâs free money, then why not.No. 2. Whenever you use a credit card,your credit rating improves,according to your payments.So, you will always,make a full payment every monthand that will enhance your credit score.No. 3, for using every credit card,you get something somewhere,as free rewards, free points.Then why not?Continue spending,what you have to spend on.Instead of that a little more,not instead, on top of thatearn a little more rewardsand points as well.Smart way of using your money.Hack No. 4,whenever you go to buy something,Make a shopping list.Even if youâre buying online,the shopping list keeps you disciplined.You don't want to be the one,who will enter a mall and then say,letâs buy this, buy this,buy this, buy this as wellthen the folks at mallwill also play on your psychology.At the counter, will try to sella few more things.Buy this chocolate, buy that Maggi,buy that chewing gum.The money with which you cameto spend and buy things,on top of that, you have boughtfive more thingsand have spent thousands more,not the smart way to do it.Also online,whenever you sit down to buy something,make a shopping list,be it on Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra,be it anywhere.You have to stick to what you want,and are to buy only that and move out.Don't misuse your money.Hack No. 6,is a very brilliant psychological hack.It's called the 30-day rule.Whenever you want to buy something big.Donât buy. Stay back for 30 days,and ask yourself after 30 daysis that thing still important to me?Most likely that answer would be no.And that is how you actually resist,if there is a sale, buy stuffand instead, youâd buy only those thingsthat you really need.Hack No. 7,if you use something occasionally,then donât buy it, take it on rent,Everything is available on rent nowadays,expensive clothes are available on rent,gadgets are available on rent,vehicles are available on rent,then if you are not a frequent user,Then, please take it on rent,you will save a lot of money.For example, I'm very fond of photography,so anytime if I go to a wildlife sanctuaryor a national park,then I want to takea really expensive lens,those 400-500 mm with fixed focus.Those are Rs. 5-6 lakhsâ lensand in a year, Iâll hardly,go for 5 or 6 days to such parks.So, why do I pay the money in full?I rent them out.I get that lens for a few thousands,and that is a smart use of my moneyand plus I get to usethe product which I want.That is how you have to think as well.Hack No. 8. Buy larger sizes.It's not that make medium into large,the consumption item that you buy,buy that at bigger sizes.Because the per unit cost of small sizesis expensive.So, if you buy one Maggior a pack of four Maggi,there is a difference.If you buy one sachet of shampooand buy a large bottle of shampoo.There is a difference.If you take a small can of teaand take a large can or bag of tea,there is a difference.That's why, if you've place in the house,please buy big size things.Keeping an eye on the expiry datebecause then you will savethe per unit expenditure.And that is actually a smart wayof using your money.Hack No. 9,is very interesting.If you buy anything online,please buy it in Incognito or safe mode.Why? Now, I can't prove that,but I've seen it a lot of times.If you ever buy something online,cookies are inserted in your browser,and then those cookies track you.If you search for the samething again and again,You'll keep noticinga gradual increase in its price.Itâs true for flights, true for clothes,true for gadgets. So, anytimeif you intend to buy something online,buy it in incognito mode,so that that website will not knowanything about you.And they will give you the price,which they would offer a new user,which more often than not,is the lowest price.because they want to convert the new userinto buying something from that website,This would not be possible on apps,So, instead of buying on a phone,buy on a desktop or laptop,then, youâll be able to save money.Something for you to consider.Hack No. 10,repay your loans as soon as possible.Now many people say that education loan,home loan is at only 6%, only 8%.Why to repay? Because if we investthe same money in the market,we can earn, 10%, 12%, 15%.All of that maybe true,but what you are doing is,you are comparingthe complete loan tenure,and in that tenure,how much will be your rate of return.I am asking you to considersomething different.Initially, with loans,it goes more towards the interestand less in repaying the loanthat you have taken.So, in the beginning itself,if you try to repay your loan,You will actually be ableto pay your loans faster.Here is math,assume youâve takena 25-year loan for your home,every year, if you give one extra EMI,that is instead of 12, pay 13 EMIs,and increase your EMI by 10% every year.That means this yearthe EMI was Rs. 10,000 per month,next year in place of 10,000,Iâll pay 11,000,then your 25-year loanwill get paid in just 10 years.And your interest,means what you're paying as expensesto the bank, that will get reduced by 60%.Meaning, if you were givingRs. 1 lakh to that bank,then now you will giveonly Rs. 40,000 to that bank.That is the power of payingoff loans early,So, as much as possible,try to repay your loan as soon as possiblebecause if you repay early,you can save interestwhile paying your principal.Hack No. 11,Need to buy life insurance,It is very vital, but the sooner you buy,the better it will be for you.When you are young, in your 20s,your health happens to be good.The probability of your hospitalizationis very low.Your death probability is very low,so, because of this you get life insuranceat a very cheap pricefor the same cover.As you grow older,your premium too,keeps increasing for the same cover.Here is an example.If, at the age of 25.you take a life insuranceand if you take it for 65 years,gives a 40-year cover.So whatever premium that you'll paythat total premium will be less,if at the age of 35,you take the same life insuranceuntil 65 years.Means, the benefit of takinglife insurance at the age of 25 years is,you get a cover for 40 years, 25 to 65,And, in those 40 yearsyou pay less premiumthan you pay in those 30 yearsif you buy insurance at 35 years.Simple math.Why wouldnât you save moneyon something which is so fundamental.Hack No. 12.Develop a financial budget for your life.Budgeting is very important.People tend to spend money unnecessarilybecause it's unknown to themwhere their money is being spent.There are a lot of budgeting principles.I have spoken about 50-30-20 many times.You can also check the video on that.50% of your maximum incomewill go towards your needs,be it your EMIs,food, electricity, water,your basic clothingall of those things, maximum 50%.30% will go for your wishes,for your desires.So, if you want to buy a phone,go on vacation,want to party,you have to accommodateall of that within this 30%.And then at least 20%,you will invest for your future,through it, you can do everythingyou want to do.I am not saying that kill yourself today,completely crucify your youth,for your old age,with absent teeth or limb movementyou will be a millionaire then,whatâs the use of such money.So, party today, do as much as you want.But also plan for the future,And it can happen only through a budget.And hack No. 13.Use deal and discount sitesas much as you can use.There should be no shame in using them.Nearbuy, for example,I receive so many emails even todaythat sir during college life.we had so much fun.Visited five-star hotels,went to expensive vacations,all thanks to Nearbuy as money got saved.Do it. The more you respect your moneyand understand its importance,money will respect you back similarlyAnd this is a smart way of doing it.Along with all this,a 14th bonus hack.And probably the most important hack.Do not focus too much on saving money,because the reality is,you have to live lifeand to live life a minimum costis always needed.Youâll have to give a minimum rentfor a shelter over the head,Will have to eat the minimum food,for your life.Will have to wear the minimum clothingfor going out,So, every personneeds to make a minimum spend.Means, you can't always cut the expenses.But there is one thing,that you can increase as much as you wantand that is your income.If you focus on your incomethen it can grow far fasterthan how much you can save money.So, if youâre in a financial situationwhere you don't have a lot of money.Then of course, through these 13 hacks,please save as much money as possibleThatâs the smart thing to do.But for your entire life,don't just focus on saving moneyInstead, majority of your focus should be,how can I increase my income?And that is not necessarilythrough a job alone.Along with a job,you can make multiple side-income streamsYou can invest,you can run a side business,you can do freelancing.You can create your intellectual property.You can create a personal brand.Anything! Through which youâll diversifyyour income streams,will not survive on just job aloneand through that,youâll keep earning money,while being smartabout where you spend that money.So, these were the 13+1 bonus hacksabout how have you can save your money.If you liked this,then I will leave you allwith a wonderful quote,which Warren Buffett once quoted,and he said,âdo not save what is left after spending,but spend what is left after saving.âFirst of all, save yourself,Saving means, give respect to yourself.Focus on yourself.So, spend what is left after saving.First save for yourself,save for your future,save for your present,and whatever remains after that,spend that.so that you can live life well.On that note, Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
