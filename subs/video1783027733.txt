I will start the recording.Let's get started.Thank you so much Aman forcoming on this channel.I've been waiting for thisconversation for a really long while.Often we meet on videosor through other people,today we are meetingone-to-one for the first time.It's a pleasure to have you.First of all, thank you forinviting me Mr. Ankur Warikoo.I am feeling very good,and I will try to give somethingto learn to all the peoplewho are watching this podcast today.And it is great to meet you,and let's start this session.Awesome.Aman, I have this conversationto understand the relationshipthat people have with money.I often create contenton personal finance suggestingabout investments and all,but I've realized that every person'sexperiences with money duringtheir growing-up years,what their parents teach them,they learn from friends,learn from their own mistakes,that builds our own experience.You are very young,only 24 years old.I am 42 years old,and I have made a lot of mistakes.You have started your life beautifully,but my first question to you is,While growing up, how was it?Did you grow up with a lot of moneyor with a lot of difficulties?What was your relationship with money?Talking about the relationship with money,I belong to Rajasthan,and my whole familyhas always been in Rajasthan.Papa's job was in  Delhi,so after childhood, my remainingschooling was completed here.And here, Papa always kept me involvedin sports since childhood.The child born in our house,either goes to the army or the police,or gets into sports.So till 10th class, I was into sports.And if you see, mom was a housewife,dad had a government job,so there was not much money,and it was not even likeI had to struggle too much.I got all facilities.I was educated in a good school,and I was also given engineering coaching,and after engineering coaching,I got admission to NSUT inthe IT branch,and the goal was always the same.Papa's goal was to crackthe government job,and mom's goal was,after watching serials,that my child should wear a suitand go to do his job well,come back home on time in the evening,and get Saturdays and Sundays off,so I went to college with this goal.And earlier I was very sadthat I didn't get admission to IIT.Then someone said that thereare colleges like NIITs, and IIITs,where you get good packagesin computer science.Then someone told us thatwe had 8 seniors in NSUT who gotpackages of â¹1.25 crores in Google,so I thought we'll be able to dosomething through this college as well.If seniors could get â¹1.25 crore,then we can also do somethingwith hard work, we are next in line,so that's it gradually started.So this is how it was.The relationship with money wasvery much like the Indian middle class.Though the Indian middle classis a very broad section,almost everybody fits into that.But yes, my family never gave metoo much money.I still remember when I was in schoolif someday I would get â¹5,then I would buy a mango bar,and if I would get â¹10,then it would be like a lotterybecause then I could buy a choco bar.And when I used to go for coachingin 11th and 12th,I recently discussed this withmy co-founder, I told him,I was going towards Pritampurato meet a creator, and then I saw a bus,the TMS bus in which I used totravel to go for my coachingin 11th and 12th to Pitampura.So I was telling him that I usedto travel in this bus forabout 1-1.5 hours.The ticket for the green buswas from â¹15, which was non-AC,and the one with AC was for â¹25.So I always used to travel inthe â¹15 bus, so that I could save â¹10.And our coaching use to finishat 8-9 at night.Now there were not many choicesat 8-9 p.m., which bus comes first,you take that.If the AC bus for â¹25 used to come first,then we used to sit downand start revising,to take all the worth outof the expensive ticket,so we used to revise properly.So my parents always used to make surethat I should value money,and this is it.They never let me become a spendthrift,but yes, they ensured therewas no dearth in my studies.Very lovely!Your TMS reminds me of allmy Mudrikaa stories.I too grew up in Delhi,used to go to Delhi University,North Campus, and there were540, 447 Mudrika buses,we spent hours in these buses,studied, made friends.And I so understand these â¹15, â¹25,green line, blue line, red line storieswhich used to be there.Wonderful, man!And this is very interesting.Your father was in government service.Your mother wanted you to geta corporate job,her son should be well suited,and earn well.When you were growing upand you had all these experiences,what is it that you wanted for yourself?First of all, in childhood,I was getting coaching in lawn tennisfrom 3rd class to 10th classfor 3-4 hours a day, so at first,I wanted to do good in lawn tennis.But as soon as I came intothe 10th class, my father said,'Son, now is the time to geta little serious.You will not become Roger Federer,and I don't want to makeyou Leander Paes.'My father's goal has alwaysbeen very big.Although Leander Paes too usedto be our idol in India.He used to be India's one ofthe best players,and he also has a legacy.Then papa asked me,'What do you want to play?'I said,'I want to play sports.'Papa said,'Son, do engineering.'So I started doing engineering.And the first question that you askedthat how was my relationship with money.I still remember, when I usedto go to Pitampura,there are a lot of coaching centers there,and there was a McDonald's there.And from childhood, we are madeto think that all the brandslike Nike, Adidas are really good,McDonald's is a big brand,I had never eaten there.When you play sports in 3rd, 4th,5th, 7th class, you need to buy shoes,socks, shorts, but I was alwaysafraid of entering the Nike, Adidas shops,so there are other brandslike Lotto, Spark,that's relatively cheaper,so I always had it in my mindthat their bigger brands.In 11th and 12th, I always usedto pass that McDonald's,but always ate the potato pattiesbelow our coaching centerbecause that was for â¹10,I never entered McDonald'sbecause I thought it is definitelygoing to be expensive.But that's also good, it's likean anecdote which you can sharewith people today.When I went to college,when I was in my first year,I went to McDonald's for the first timewith 7-8 friends,and I took a selfie standingin front of McDonald,that today was the first timeI was going to McDonald's,and McAloo Tikki was for â¹35at that time, now it must be higher.Since childhood, through brand marketing,brands a given a higher imagein our minds.But my childhood was good, that's it.Wonderful, man!And Aman, I noticed that did youstart a YouTube channel in 2014?No, it was registered in '14,I started in '15.Ok.So even that was very early!Today you are 24 years old, right?I am 24.So that means you started thatYouTube channel when you werealmost 16-17 years old.Yes, I was 17 at that time.As soon as I finished my 12th,and I was in the first yearof my college, about to turn 18,that's when I started.My main motive was, I wasa very shy child, and I thought,'I am studying, listening towhatever my parents are saying.'Even my parents used to givemy example to my siblings saying,'Look at Aman,he is so simple and honest.'So my parents never had anycomplaints with me,like being called by school teachersfor being notorious,or getting scolded, nothing like that.But I was extremely shy.If someone would ask me to go upon the stage and say something,my legs use to tremble,I was dumbfounded,so I thought of beating this barrierin college, and entered intoas many activitiesand as many societies as I could.And then someone told me to speakin front of the mirror.I tried speaking in front of the mirrorand it seemed very weird and funny.I couldn't do that.Then someone told me to try speakingin front of the camera.I did not have a camera, so I startedwith the mobile cameras,the low-quality cameras availableon phones in 2014-15.And I wondered what is itthat I could create?Comedy was not my cup of tea.I thought, I knew my education,I had just passed out 12th,that's what I will talk about,that was the beginning.You know how the views are initially,about 5-10-15 views.And I don't know how, even afterthose 5-10-15 views,after 2-3 videos, my family came to knowthat I create videos,and that was my most embarrassing moment.I didn't want my family to know,and they saw my video.But they said,'It's good dear that you aremaking this, and that's how you willimprove on yourselfand learn how to speak.'Gradually, I saw in the commentsthat children used to say,'Tell us more, share these notes,teach us this.'And that's how I kept uploadingvarious things.And in the first year of college,that's how I started,I didn't know anything aboutmonetization or does it even work.In 2014-15 was very weak in termsof Indian monetizationat the world level,it's very weak even today.So I just startedand I was enjoying it.Brilliant man!And at what point did you feelthat now it has become serious?Like now, of course, you almosthave an education empire of sorts.No no.You will be humble when you saythat but go on.You describe in your own language,what is it that you do today?Today our goal is, and we startedwith the year, we were teaching8 lakh students every daythrough social media,and I discussed the goalfor the next year with my team.So people ask, what would beyour goal revenue-wise?What would be your goalin different arenas?I said to everybody,'Our one and only goal is,today we are teaching8 lakh students in a day,and by the end of this year,I want to increase itto 21 lakh students.So we have to bring in almosta threefold growth.'Last month, we taught around16 lakh students per day,so that is my biggest success.When it comes to tracking a numberon YouTube studio,the only number I see is,how many children are viewingyou every day?That make me feel good!If so many children are watching us,and even one percent of them areseriously studying thenthat's also a good number.I'd never even imagined that8 lakhs per day or 15 lakhs per daywould be learning from us,and that makes me really happy!That's why I enjoyed taking seminars,because that child who iswatching the behind the camera,in the seminarswe meet them directly one-to-one.That's nice!That's about it!I am enjoying it!And I am very grateful thatI was very shy till the 12th,and I don't know how,by God's grace or what,I am here today, but yes,I kept working consistently,and somehow I got this right directionwhere I get student's appreciation,and somehow it's in our controlthat how good can we teach.So we have decided on 5-6 pointsfor our company which areour basic values,and we chase that one simple goalwith those values,and better our systemsso that we can reach that goalin a more efficient way.Brilliant, man!I think the best thing I findabout you and your content is,first of all, the energy,unbelievable energy.Like you are sayingthat you were very shy,it's difficult to believe,because I can't imaginea shy Aman as against the oneI see today.You don't have to imagine,you can watch the oldest videoson my channel.I have delibeartely stillkept them there,they are very funny.In the first video, I thoughtI will speak in English,so I am speaking with an accent.But I've kept it intentionally so far.I guess there'll be some more kidslike me, and I always tell them,'See, if I used to speak so badly,and now I can speak a little bit,then if you will practice,you can start singing.'So if anyone ever feelsthat they can't speak,go and watch my very first videoon my channel, and if you getsome inspiration from there,it's all about practice.The more videos you make,the more you teach,or the more chances you geton different stages,you will go on speaking there,the more opportunitiesyou will get among people,the more this skill will become better.And every year, when I watchmy 6-month-old content,how I used to teach or speak, I feel,'Why was I speaking like this?It's really bad.That's how I should have spoken!'Again after 6 months,I used to think thatthe 6-month-old content is bad.So after every 6 months,you find the old content bad.I think even that is necessary.That's how you realizethat the more you work,the more this skill gets polished.Absolutely! So true man, wonderful!Aman, at the point when youdecided that you will not sitfor placements, you will not doa corporate job, you will becomean entrepreneur,theses 8 lakh students per daygoing to 21 lakh students per day,and by God's grace it willincrease even more,did you have to convince yourself?I am assuming that you weretotally convinced.But did you have to convinceanybody else, parents, friends,somebody else?Friends are not to be convinced as such.Those who need to be convincedare parents.And to be honest,I was not that seriousin the 1st-2nd year.I guess in the 3rd year,we achieved the 1st play button of 1 lakh.And I went to my familyand told them thatI want to do this, and obviously,my family refused,and then I also agreed.I agree with whatever my family says,I have a simple principle,especially with my father.If I see the history,9 out of 10 decisionsmade by my father were correct,so I trusted him with a 90% probability.If my father said,'Son, do this, don't do that.'I agreed, because he must havethought of something,he would only wish well for me.Then one day, my younger brothergot very angryHe was in 9th or 10th at that time,and few of his friends knew about me,and they said,'Aman bro, you should putin some more effort.'So he went to my father and said,'Papa, you are destroyingAman bro's future!'So papa got scaredand he asked me again, so I said,'Let's decide on a deadline.Let me work on it in the 4th yearand the next year.Let me put my energy intomy private work for two years.If it works out, perfect,otherwise, I can attempt UPSC anytime,there is a lot of time.'Papa agreed to it.So my father always hada principle that decidea deadline for whateveryou are doing.Everybody in my family is ina government job, so papa used togive a deadline to everybody.If you want to attempt UPSC,then you have these many years.If you want to attempt SSC,then you have these many years.After that, we will changeour goal, right,we will give these many years,we cannot keep attempting it.So that's it.And to be honest, if you willask me how many yearsit took me to convince them,then I think I have conveyedit in a very nice manner,but approximately I was convincing themthroughout the 1st-2nd-3rd year.Earlier he did not like YouTube only!He thought,'We are putting so much money intoengineering and he is wasting timeon YouTube by making videos.'I used to fool him by sayingthat it took me 15 minutesto make a 15 minute video,and he used to believe me.Mummy was still not very convinced,so I opened a YouTube channelfor her as well,I made her a part of the same thingso she could not scold me anymore.So that's how it was.I got my first incomearound 1.5 years later,it was around â¹14,000,and I was in the second yearof my college, I don't exactly remember,I think I was in the third semester,so I gave that.I treated my mother to lunchin DLF Mall in Saket.It's just that it wasmy first salary of â¹14000,and â¹14000 was a big amount for me,but otherwise,â¹14000 is not a big amount.So I took out â¹500 notes fromthe ATM so that I havea bunch of 28 notes,and I gave them that bunch,so that it feels good.And in the beginning,I guess I was getting aroundâ¹10-15 every day,but even they felt goodbecause I used to think thatI bought my own samosa.I really love the samosa,so whenever I see something,I start looking at it inthe form of a samosa.If this thing is for â¹2500,then it means 250 samosas,this is what I used to doin my childhood when I wasin 11th-12th class.I don't do it nowbut I used to do it then.I used to get â¹5-10 frommy family at that time.I had â¹100, I used to thinkit is equal to 10 samosas,so should I eat 10 samosasor should I buy this?So I would eat 10 samosas!That is so awesome, man! Very nice!And where you are today,you have Apni Kaksha,your own channel, of course,you have made Apni Kaksha for9th and 10th as well,you have opened a channelfor your mum as well,with all these incomes coming in,I am sure you must be havingbrand collaborations,you have your own course business,there's ad revenue...I would say more than business,I would like to say something,the way we are operating right now,all the courses that we havebrought out till now,I can save more than 100%,more than 99...%,our children study for free.The number of paid customersthat we have, we have launchedvery few courses till now,and the courses that we havelaunched are of very short duration.Last year they were longer,but this year they are short.So it's one thing to runa YouTube channel and you are solo,like I am the YouTube creatorand I have to run the channel alone,and in that particular scenario,if you have a huge audience,and you are constantly uploading,then you can pull off revenue,there is influence marketing and all,you can make a decent revenue with that.In our case, we have a huge team,and the teachers from JEE-NEETare very expensive.Their package goes from â¹50 lakhs-1 crore.And then you have a huge teamof video editors,a huge team of typists,then there's system management,so when you have all this,you can never match the expensejust by doing YouTubeand influencer marketing,and eventually, even the coursesthat we have launched,are at a price of â¹3000-4000,which is 1% of the market price.The course which was for â¹3 lakh,the faculties are now giving it for â¹3000.Basically, to tell you in short,in this also even 99% of the childrenstudy for free,less than 1% children buy the course,because we have not yet touchedall the segments,we have not yet worked on class 12th,I don't want to give a detailedanswer for this,you can even crop itif you want in your edit.No, it's really good, man!My goal is, if you want to teachso many children,15-16 lakh children every day,it would require a lot of faculties,a huge team,and if I somehow keep managingand putting in moneyfrom my own pocket,then it will be exhaustedat some of the other point,and the system will not be able to run.Absolutely!Yes.So obviously, it's a bootstrap model.If you look at the majority of businesses,which we call startups,are big unicorns.And to be honest, if you lookat the condition of thebig ed-tech unicorns today,they are not doing very well.Somewhere 400 people are being fired,somewhere 1000 people are being fired,you will soon get the news thatsomewhere 2000 people areabout to be fired.And in such a scenario, the thing is,content is easily available today,we upload our best contenton social media.What I tell my teacher is,'We have to create the content,I don't know if you will staywith me for 6 months, 1 year, or 3 years,I would like you to stayconnected with Apni Kaksha for lifr,but the chapter you will teach today,that chapter will stay there,and lakhs of children will watch it,and that chapter will be your brand,that chapter will decidehow good a teacher you are.So whatever energy you have,whether you have to give it5 attempts, 6 attempts,when a new teacher joins,we polish them for 10-15 days,we tell them how to make slides,how to give oration,where to give the pauses,this is how we polish themin the best way possible,and try to deliver the best contentin our recorded format.In the live format,the teachers are the same,and then during the live exam,they make them do revisions again.So my ultimate goal is,I started 'Apna College' channel as well,and it's doing pretty good in India,around 2.25 crores of childrenare studying through it monthly.Wow!And my co-founder in it,she is from Haryana,she belongs to a village,and she cracked Microsoft,and after cracking Microsoft,I got to meet her, and we decidedto try working on this,then she left his job in Microsoft.So the village that personbelongs to, she said,'There are not many facilitiesin my village, my family told me thatif I want to do something in lifeI will have to study,and I was studious since childhoodand that's how I cracked Microsoftand did all this.'She recently gave a talk somewhere,and in that talk she said,'I will feel good on that daywhen somebody from my village saysthat I learned this from you.'So the ultimate goal isthat we are able to operateat a level, that not onlythe children in 11th or 12th,not just children in college,not just children in coding,not just the children in 9th or 10th,we are able to reach out tothe children from 6th, 7th,8th, 9th, 10th,all the engineering streams,whatever content we can createto the best of our abilities,I should post that.And till today,more than 99% of our childrenstudy for free,and watch the best of thecontent possible while sitting at home.And the goal is that if somehowin the bootstrap model only,I can take it ahead and givemy best possible.I will work hard to the age of 30,I will not be able to do thisafter the age of 30.It will be 10-12 years of teaching,and then at the age of 30,I would like to do something new,something offline, which would be,I have a lot of interest in farming.I am from Rajasthan,I have seen farms from my childhood,so that's it.Brilliant, man!That's the goal.Wonderful, I love it!Aman, do you have any interestin politics?No bro, I don't have much interestin politics.Please don't ask me whichis my favorite party?No, no you yourself are a party.At some point in time, peoplelike you will have to come togetherand start influencing thepolitical system of this country.And of course, I am not passingthe burden on you becauseI am as responsible as youor any other citizen of this country.Mahatma Gandhi once said,'You don't have to be a part ofthe system if if you want tochange the system.'If you talk about Mahatma Gandhi,or there are so many otherbig freedom fighters who were martyred,they were not in any political powernor in any positionnor in a government job,so I really like this quote of his.Once BeerBiceps also saidthe same thing to me thatwhen we grow up we will makea political party.And I said,'We will do what we are doingtill the age of 30,only after 30, will we work onsomething else and see where it goes.'Brilliant, man! Amazing! Lovely!The ambition is so grand, so kind,so thoughtful,that I enjoyed listening to it.Awesome, man!So now out of curiosity,do you consider what you haveas a company,and run it like a company?I made it into a companyaround 9-10 months back.Before that, I used to run itas a proprietorship organization.Somebody told me that,'You have a lot of peoplein your company,so you have to convert itinto a company,you cannot run it in proprietorshipfor so many years.'So I formed it into a company.So to say, it's a company,but all of us operate together.This is the same office from whereI started around 3 years back.It used to be a garage earlier,and then gradually,we built it into a full building,and we have around 10-11 studiosin this building,and we work through those studios.We have studios in Kota,we run our classes from there too.So it's good, we are teaching!Amazing, man!So you...Sorry sir, go ahead.No, no please, please I getcarried away and keep talking.Oh no, I am really enjoying your stories,this is exactly the motive ofthe conversation, it's really good.Aman, I wanted to ask,do you draw a salary every month,or as the company founder,you take whatever you needfrom the company?How does money work for youpersonally now?I do not draw a salary.Let me tell you from the beginning,last year in August we launchedour self as an app and a websitefor the first time.Before August, the situation was,we had never sold a course forthe five years that we taughtthe children,we launched our app and websitejust 8 months back.And there were months whenthe whole company organizationwas negative â¹25 lakhsbecause we were not selling anything,and this happened with uscontinuously for 4-5 months,when such things happenedwe understood that it will be over soon,nothing will be left this way,it will be absolutely zero,so we have to do something.I saw that a lot of people werelaunching their courses,and I thought let's releasesomething at a minimal price,and today, one child studies with usfor 5-6 hours at a cost of â¹10.Wow!Yes, so you can watch it as many timesat whatever speed you want whilesitting at home, and study effectively.So that was it, that's how we started.Whatever is left at the end of the year,is for the organization, I mean,I have not fixed a salary for myself.See, it's a bootstrap.There are funded startups,and in funded startups,as the investor comes in,they will fix your salary,and tell you what you should do.In a bootstrap, you are investingyour own money, and when you do that,the profit becomes your,and if you are at a loss,then the loss is also yours.Just the wayAggarwal sweet corner operates,it's the same,it's just that we're operating in ed-tech.Exactly!What has been your biggest purchasein your life?Faculties.That is such a great purchase!That is actually an investment,calling it a purchasewould be inefficient.Then really estate would bea big purchase, to be serious,real estate takes a big investment.And if you ask me business-wise,the salaries of the facultiesor when we build studios,studios are quite expensive,so that's it.And you just mentioned that youhad a difficult duration of 4-5 months,was that the toughest periodof your life when it comes to money,or you have seen more difficult timesbecause of money?Oh no! I don't take so much of a load!What difficulty!Difficulty was in childhood,my parents took care in childhood,and after that,I had started working in college.And I had read somewhere that,the difficulty will alwayscome in the last.It is yet to come,the most difficult situationis yet to come,and when it will come,and when we overcome it,we will have overcome eventhe biggest challenge.So never thought of it like that!It's simple, there's a simple trickto bootstrap,you have to be cash positive.If somehow you are able to becash positive then the race can be long.It is possible that a funded startupwill do the same thing in 5 years,whereas you may take 10-12 years,so that's not a problem!Amazing, man!So I put my full energy on my content,and to be honest,I really like doing seminars.I've already taken around 94 seminars,and I go for it every day,sometimes it is at a far away place,so it takes about 2-3 days.My mother asks me why do you like it?I said I enjoy it,I feel good that's why I do it.You know, the way that I visualize youis you are actually a performer.And you have really very well polishedyour talent in this many years,you have groomed and improved yourself,and now when you perform, I can imagine,I would love to be in a seminarone day and see you,but I can imagine if the energyof your video is anything to go by,then you must be giving goosebumpsto the children,that Aman bro is right in front of us,and the entire seminar energy,and you not just teaching them,but also motivating them,inspiring them,because this role of big brother isso rare, and so precious for every child,especially in India,that somebody like you to adopt that,it is what they need.No, if I have taken it 94 seminars,whatever I have said,somebody cannot say different thingsin all the 94 seminars,let's say it would be contentof about 5-6 seminars.When I go to the seminar,sometimes they last foraround 3.5-4 hours,my main motive is that 400 studentshave come to attend this seminar,and I will stay there tillall 400 are satisfied.So I say,'Keep raising your hands.'Whatever a student asks,we have a discussion on it.And just as our Honest Talkis very aggressive,and there's a lot of energy,because that is a small sessionof 12-15 minutes,and you have to conveyan important message in that session.But when I go to a seminar hall,where will anybody go from there,you have come with your own interest,it's not like a video where peoplecan shift on to another one,and I have to retain themwith full energy.So when I sit there, I say,'Ask me all your genuine doubts,don't take out your cameras,try not to record it and upload itso that I can be as frank as possible,and I can give something of whateverI have learned to 300-400 of youas a takeaway.'I also try to have a one-to-one,like if I see a shy child like me,I bring them on to the stage,and start a small session with themwhere they tell somethingabout themselves.So the main motive is thatfor the 300-400 children sittingin that room, the best justicecan be done to them.So sometimes I talk very peacefully,sit casually with them,and sometimes we take it up a notch.So I would like to see myselfas a big brother ratherthan a performer.That's what I say in every video too,I have no other motive.Everybody tends to make mistakes,and definitely, I might have madea lot of mistake earlier,I can still make mistakesin the future, or even right now,and people learn from their mistakes,but I always try to givethe best of what I know,and sometimes I even say in the videos,'Don't mind, treat me as your big brother,I consider you as myyounger brother or sister,and let's start with today's session.'Awesome, man!I love it!Perfect, man!Towards the end of the conversation,I will ask you 5 rapid-fire questions,answer whatever comes to yourmind immediately, Aman,and if the answer would be interesting,I will definitely ask the reason.First, what is more important for you,money or power?I guess, power is in 4-5 forms.The first one is political power,where a person is electedand he gets a good position.The second one is when you havea lot of people with you.Let's say, there is a creatoror an influencer, and a lot of peopleare connected with them,then that is also a kind of power.The third power is money.Money is also a kind of powerbecause you can give people money,and get your work done accordingly,and create a product.And the fourth one is calledthe social norms.So I would say money is alsoa form of power, so obviously,money is a subcategory of power,so they sort of become one.Brilliant!I agree!Apni Kaksha or Apna College?If you have to pick one.Oh, man! What are you doing!Oh, man! All my teachers will diefighting among themselves!Ok, you like that channel!OK, now we know! What you said that day,now we understand why you said it!I am fond of both of them.What do you think, where wouldyou like to create more impact?Forget about where would it happen becauseit may happen on both the channels.If you ask me froman investment point of you,then Apni Kaksha needs more investmentbecause the faculties are ata higher expensive end.And if you ask from a future perspective,then I think Apni Kaksha is doing well,but Apna College must be givinga strong impact,and I have high hopes for it.I would 100% agree with that, man! Nice!Sleeping at 1 a.m. or waking up at 4 a.m.?Sleeping at 1 a.m.And this depends on my phases.Till the 12th class, you are ina different phase of a student,then you are in a different phasefor 4 years of college,and then when you are in a job sector,a different phase starts.So in every phase,the sleeping time was different.If a 12th class student is watching,please don't think that you haveto wake up at night and study,you should sleep on time.Sleep at a fixed timeand wake up at a fixed time.College students can do anything.And when you are running a company,then you have to work accordingto the company timings.If people are awake in the morningthen you are also awake.Absolutely!Though you are 24 years old,still I'll ask the question.If I were to give you 2 choices, thatAman, I will give you â¹50 crores today,do whatever you want to do with it,or I will once again make you 20 years oldbut with all the knowledgethat you have today,which one would you choose?I am still getting â¹350-400 crores,but I refused.But if you are giving me 4 years extra,then I will take the money.Awesome! I love it! Brilliant!Last question.As Aman of today, what do you think isthe most expensive purchase of your life,or what would you like to buywhich you think would bethe most expensive?As I told you, I want to do farmingat the age of 30,so I want to acquirea large piece of land,it would be a barren land.And the first thing is that,if I want to do farming at the age of 30,then its water level has to berisen up for 2-3 years.If you buy a land with a good water level,it will be very expensive,so you buy a barren land,so that you get a larger piece of land,and you raise its water levelfor 2-3 years,so I guess, that's where thebiggest investment would be done,but that's not happening now,it would be after 4 years.Awesome man!God willing it will be exactlyas you have thought,it would be much better than that.And it was so lovely tospeak to you, Aman.It was nice to hear your honest,transparent, and candid thoughts,and it is such a wonderful thingthat you are doing.Keep doing it, God bless you,and thanks for sparing time.I would like to add one thing in the end.Please.I don't want that this sessionshould be about me.The name of the session is,Session with Aman Broand Mr. Ankur Warikoo,but all the children who are watching,just make sure of one thing,whether you are in 9th-10th-11th-12th,1st or 4th year of collegeor even later, when it was my time,don't think about where you are now,always look at where you need to go,and what will be your way to get there.We sometimes see people,that this person has reached here,I don't know whether I will be ableto do this or not.I also see many people who havereached places in their life.But I always tell myself that runlike a marathon racer,keep your competition with yourself.This is a very long race.If our competition is goingon since childhood, in school,in college, everywhere,you will continue to competeleft and right,you will always be worriedto come top in the class,but you should competewith yourself, focus on yourself.Mr. Warikoo, in the last 1.5 years,I have just learned one thing,when you are in a race,many people come to distract you.In childhood, relatives distract you,friends distract you.When you are running a company,big corporates come to distract you.And their main purpose is,if see so many cases,the one who in the middleof big companies,a big company will tryto acquire a small company.They will waste their 6 months to 1 year,and it will vanish itself,and the other one may loseits momentum meanwhile.So you will see these typesof wolves everywhere.If you get distracted from your goal,let me see what they are doing,let me compete with them or that.Learn from every personif someone has a good thing.Learn even from a treethat it is growing,learn from a dog how loyal he is,he wakes up suddenly,and falls asleep immediately.Learn from every animal,every person,learn from everyone.But if you start competing with everyone,I have to compete with this one too,see, a lion has a lot of energy,it brings instant energy,but the wolf kills with stamina,while the elephant kills using its size,and the python kills with patience.So you have to see what powerGod has given you,or what is something that youhave strengthened since childhood.If you haven't found it yet,it doesn't matter,even we didn't find it for many years,so you keep searching.And in the first-second-third year,you will be very confusedabout what to do,I have so many things to do,I should study for college,for a job, for government,do my own work,all this is very normal.But as you get into the 2nd year-3rd year,eventually you'll have to decidewhich one rabbit I do want to run after.Never run after two rabbits.Catch one,we will never be able to catch both.And invest most of your energyon that one.No work is small.The question is, are you ableto do anything good atthe India level in that work?Never underestimate yourself.Always believe in yourself.You will fall, you will fallnot once but many times.And each one has many flaws.There are thousands and millionsof shortcomings in me.My mother wakes up every morningand tells me thatI do not eat breakfast on time.The scolding I used to getin childhood,I am still being scolded.But I see that there is one thing,and that is what I have to keep improving.Yes, every day I try to bea better version of myself.Everyone will be demotivated,you pickup yourself back.In today's social media era,where a lot of information isavailable on our left-right,but a lot of distractionis also available.So if you make some good booksas your friend,keep yourself surroundedby some good mentors.If you can meet those peopleas you want to be,they will save you from many pits,you will continue to geta good direction,you will feel thatif they have done it,then I can too.And sir, you will keep movingforward in life.And if anything, like Mr. Warikoo asked,did you start in 2015?So if you count the total,it is going to be 7 years,this is what happens,but these 7 years flew by like this.So you too might be sittingat your home in shorts today,in AC or cooler in summer,you can also change your destinyin 5-7 years from today.And in fact, it's a digital age now,if you right-click things,then even within 3-4 years,you can go up with a pretty good hook.People will pull you down,but that is very normal.Even after seeing your age,they will say that you area very small child,that thing will be spoken.But keep going on,keep learning.Have humility, the needfor humility is very high today.Arrogance should not be therethat I know everything.There should be humilitythat I can be wrong too,otherwise, this is life,it will do you wrong oncein an unbelievable way,then you will be humble.Recently I read a book bya US investor,you must have heard of him,Ray Dalio,he has published many good books.And that person said that in1982 I had run a hedge fund of mine,and I had made a predictionthat the entire US economywould collapse in 1982,and I had bet all my money on it.And I was very confident,very arrogant.When someone used to speak,I used to say,'No, it will definitely happen in 1982'.Now from 1982 tillthe next 18 years,the complete economy had a boom,and all his money was lost.So he said thatthat one lesson instilledso much deep humility in me.So always be open, that'Yes, I could be wrong too,I have to learn from everyone else.'Keep your last decision afterlistening to everyone,and just go ahead, boss.There is no one to stop you.In your 20s, there is no oneto stop you except you.Sometimes we try to be our worst enemy,that is basic human nature.But man, if you keep the belief,then gradually, you will be reachingyour goal within the next 5 years.With this, I would like to end.I hope that I have been able tohelp all the students here a bit.And see you, that's it!Amazing, man!Brilliant ending!I love that!This is going to be the start!Thank you so much, Aman!Thanks for everything, man!It is really good,I really enjoyed myself!And I hope I get to meet youin person sooner than later.Until then, keep doing your good work,and may your energy be maintained.I have a small request.Please.As for this year, I decided thatwe will not be launching any coursesfor our children.
