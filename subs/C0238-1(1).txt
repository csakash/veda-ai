Alright check 1 2 check 1 2So, in case this is the first videoyou are watching, new setup.For you Shivam, I am recordingbut there is the sound of rain fallingon the rooftop, I have also placedanother phone in the backgroundwhich is recording the ambient noisebut of course, it is recording my voiceas well because the room is this much.See if that helps you, if it doesn't,too bad, we'll figure it out.Ok, let's startI learned a very important thing aboutlife from stock investing, which I willshare with you in this video, that is notimportant that you have to focus on growthall the time, it is as muchimportant to focus on another element.Friends, I recently made a video onalpha and beta of stock investing,and when I was making this videoI realized how much I use alpha and betain my life but not for investing,instead to take my decisions in life.So, through this video, I will try toexplain alpha and beta once again in short,and then explain to you that how do I usethis concept of alpha and beta inmy life outside of investing.Why is it so important?And how you can also apply it to your life?First of all, what are alpha and beta?So, in stock investing whenever you buya company's stock, by the way, I havemade a video on this in which you canwatch it in detail, but to complete this videoI want to give you a short descriptionand definition of alpha and beta.So, in stock investing whenever youbuy a company's stock,then more often than not evaluate 2 things.Number 1, how much return will thisstock generate for us? And this return is alwaysmeasured in relative terms, not in absolute.What is that relativity?If you buy every company's stockwhich is called an index fund.Index fund means, BSE or Bombay Stock Exchangeand NSE or National Stock Exchange have grownin the last 10-20 years, there is a numberattached to it and that keeps growing,so if you are betting on that numberand 10-20 years back you had bought a fundor stock of that index, then your growthwould be according to the growth of the index.And in the last 20 years, the index has returnedanywhere close to 12-14% annually,which means your money grew by 12-14% every year.Now if you buy a stock and that givesyou the same to 12-14% growth,then what is the use of that stock?It would have been better ifI would have bought an index fund,and that is why Alpha or the metriccomes into play, and this tells youhistorically how fast or slow this stockgrew in comparison to the index.A positive alpha means that it showedmore growth than the index, a negative alphameans that it grew lesser than the index.For example, if the index grew by10% in the last two years and youinvested in a stock whose alpha is 2,then it means that this stock beatthe index growth of 10% by 2% which meanson average stock grew by 12%.But if this alpha is -1, then it meansthat this stock grew -1% as comparedto the index, whose growth rate was 10%,which means this stock grew by around 9%.Often we only observe alpha and make a decision.We think that its alpha is positivewhich means it will show more growththan the index, we must invest,or its alpha is less, the growth islesser than the index so don't invest.Which is why the second metric isextremely useful because there isa possibility that the thing whichis giving you good growth hasa lot of risk attached to it.It is also possible that the thingwhich is giving you less growthor relatively lesser growthbut the risk in it is extremely low,and you may want to prefer that.So, let me ask you a questionListen to this question with closed eyesand then you can answer it in thecomments section after pausing the video.You have option of 2 stocks,one has alpha 5 which means it beatthe index by 5% add another stock has alpha -1,if you have to buy one of these two stocksthen which one will you choose?And I would imagine most of you will say alpha 5.Great!But now I will introduce the other metriccalled beta which shows how risky is a stock.If I ask you that the stock with alpha 5is very risky which means it fluctuatesrapidly and your heart would always be pounding,you would always be nervous,but at the end of the year itwill give you that 5% extra return.The others stock with alpha -1 is very smooth,it grows slowly and gradually very comfortable.It doesn't grow as much as the indexbut the growth it shows which is -1% of indexis very consistent, it doesn't make you nervous,it grows at a steady pace without fluctuations.Now which one will you pick?Maybe the answer is not alpha 5Maybe you are not the kind of personwho wants to to play the game ofa fluctuating stock, but maybe yournature is such that you are totallyok with it, you are likeBring it on, it doesn't matter,we are risky playersRisk is fun! So we'll do that!Now that changes the equation, right?That is what beta does.Beta is the measurement of volatility/riskin the stock, which means if the index isfluctuating then how much will this stockfluctuate in comparison to the index.If the beta is 1 then it means it willfluctuate identically as the index,so if you are in line or balanced withthe equity market risk, you are agreeableto what happens in the equity marketor the stock market, then for you betaequals 1 which means as stock market fluctuates,this stock will also fluctuate.I am ok with thatBut if a stock has beta 2...But if a stock has beta 2, which meansif the index goes up, this stock will go as much up...But if a stock has beta 2, which meansif the index goes up then this stockwill go twice as much up,and if this stock goes down...But if a stock has beta 2,which means if the index goes upthen this stock will go twice as much up,and if the index goes down thenthe stock will go twice as much down.Now that made seem like its balanced.It is as much up as it is downNet net is fineNo, because if you look at one year,it is possible that in that one year theindex mostly degrew or declined or went down,so this negative stock which has beta 2 willgo twice as much down, and you willthen have a lot more volatility.If the beta of the stock is less than 1,let's say it is 0.9 or 0.5,which means when the index goes upthen this stock will grow by half of it,when the index goes downthen the stock will go down by half of it,which means there is lesser volatilityand what I argued in the videowhose link you can see right now,and it's there in the pinned comment,that what you are looking for in lifeare high alpha low beta stocks.The stocks whose Alpha is highwhich means there grow more thanthe index but beta is low which meansthe risk is less than the index.And when you extrapolate that,you get a way of living life.It is so important to understandalpha and beta in life becauseso many of your decisions can besimplified using this logic.Let me give you an example.I'll start with a very small example.Let's say you are partying today.It's Friday night, you are happywith your friends, you are drunk,you are high, you are above thealcohol limit, you know that maybeyou should not drive a caror if you have a bike then maybeyou should not ride on the bike,but you are likeIf I don't take my car or bike,then I will have to take an Ola or Uberand its expense is more than the petrolor maybe I will not get it,I will have to wait for it,or it's altogether a differentfun of driving when highSo you feel that you willmiss out on all these thingsI will either end up paying more money,I will either end up waiting for late,Or I will not get that enjoymentthat will come by drunken driving.This means that your alpha,what you are looking for in terms of growthis saving money, saving time,and having a good time.But what is it beta, friends?Because if you only concentratedon Alpha then the answer is right there.We should absolutely go ahead with it,you should drive the car or bikeeven though you are absolutely drunk,it doesn't matter, you will savemoney and time and have a good time as well.But what is its beta?What is the risk associated with that?And when you think about that,you realize that it's beta,there is no capping on the downside.Unfortunately, if you lose your balance,if you lose your senses at that point in time,you could actually die!Your life can get over!That is the beta.The beta is so negative thateverything can get done with.So you realize that whatevermay be the alpha, it will never be ableto compensate for the fact that betais negative unlimited, and that makesit super clear at least to me,that there is no point in chasing this alpha.You should not run behind this alphaAnd this is such a simple examplefor thinking about life,and I would love for you tostart making it part of your vocabulary.Oh man, its alpha is good butthe beta is not worth the risk!Another exampleYou are not happy in your jobYou have joined a job but you hate the jobYou are getting good money, it'sa stable income but the boss is toxic,work is not good,you are not happy with your colleagues,brand is not good, whatever the case may be,and you want to quit and look for another job.What is its alpha?If you quit...What is its alpha?If you quit the alpha is that you willnot have an income, so you may not beable to pay the billsand that could be a serious condition.You may not get a job for some timeand that could be a serious condition.Your parents may not be happy with you,they may be upset with you,that could be a condition.Your friends may make fun of you,that could be a condition.But what is its beta?What is the risk attached with it?The risk attached with this is,if you continue in this job you maylose your mental balance, you mayactually be extremely unhappy in life,you may not be able to do anything else.So if you really think about it in my head,the alpha which is the potential loss of income,the potential loss of respect in your society,beta is much more negative than that,that I don't want to be here.But if, if your entire family is dependenton your salary, then it is not aboutwhat you are feeling, it is about the factthat if you will not get next month's salarythen how will you manage your house,then the equation changes,because then your alpha is notabout that people will make fun of youor get upset with you, it is aboutyour life not moving forward,there will be no money food, for studies,for household expenses, whatever is it.So now even if the beta is thatmy mental state is not right,my health will get affected,I will not have time to do thingsthat I want to do, your alpha isfar far far worse, and you haveno choice but to continue with that.Now that's not what I am recommendingI am not saying that if you are ina job where you are not happy andyou are dependent on that incomethen also don't leave that job,but what you have to do then is,if the alpha-beta of this decision  is not right,of quitting the job right away,then what do I have to do?I have to increase the alpha of this decision.How do I increase the alpha of this decision?Find another job and make that my only job.My full attention will not be on doing this job,it will be on finding another jobso that I can leave this job,but not say goodbye to the income that I need.This is how you have to think about it.This is how decisions in life have to be thoughtful,that what is the alpha and beta of anything?If I do this then how does it affectmy growth and what is the risk in doing this?Another example, cryptocurrencyCryptocurrency suddenly becamevery famous last 2-3 monthswhere everyone was buying Bitcoin,everyone was buying Ethereum,everyone was buying SolanaEverybody was liking all the coinsWhy?Because of AlphaAlpha was through the roofsIt was growing by 10% 20% overnightGrowth of 100% in a monthBrilliant right?Beta, it's almost as if no one thought about itAnd all those people who invested in Cryptoat its peak are now regretting itbecause the investment is down by 40% or 50%.It's slowly recovering but they are likeShit! Whatever little moneyI had even that has gone down,now I have no more faith in crypto.And that is your first understandingof how alpha and beta play with your mind,your emotions, your personality.You have become fond of alphabut never checked the betaYou were in love with what is the growththat can come by but you did not ask forwhat is the risk associated with it.Alpha and beta are two sides of one coin!And that is why they can never be separated.If you like alpha thenit is important to ask about its beta.If you do not like Alpha then does it haveless beta, it is important to know thatBecause in life it is not alwaysabout going for the highest growth potential,it is also about lowering therisk to get to that potential.This understanding of alpha and betahas changed my life.There are so many decisions in my lifethat I have taken that even if alphais a little bit low but sincethe beta was low I have been able to take it.Even if Alpha was very high,but the beta was also very high,then I did not take it.There are so many examples like thatDoing my MBALeaving my job after my MBA and doing a start-upLeaving that start-upand then doing another start-upLeaving an extremely comfortable job in Grouponand starting NearbuyMaking Nearbuy profitable andthen leaving it and then start a new journeyGetting into content creationGetting into teachingMaking the videosInteracting with all of youAll of those were like their alpha is unlimitedIf this game of content creation,if this relationship works out,then it can change my life,and the risk in it is almost zero,because if it doesn't work,what's the worst thing that would happen?People will make fun of meThey will say that I startedcreating content at the age of 40and see where he landedAnd that's okI am totally ok with thatBut if it worked out, it can changeeverything!And that means unlimited alpha at limited betaWhy wouldn't I select that?Why wouldn't you select that?If you want to run your own start-upand you genuinely believe thatthat is the next thing thatyou would want to do, can youimagine the high alpha that you can getbut limited beta if you havetaken that decision wisely?You have income for the next6 months or 12 monthsYou have the understanding, the agreementof your parents, of your partners,or whosoever you care aboutYou have a good team that can deliverAll the things by which you can reduceyour risk while ensuring thatthe alpha is as high as possible.That is what the game isSo in life, in summary,go for the highest Alpha with the lowest beta.And whatever decision that you want to take,before taking it ask yourself,what is its alpha? Which meanswhat can it do to change my life?And what is its beta? Which meanswhat is the risk associated with it?And if you are not happy with the answer,then do everything that you can to increasethe Alpha that means go and figure outhow it can change your life,and do everything to lower the beta,that means all the risks associatedwith this decision, try and reduce themto however much you can.Once you do that, you are not justa great investor, you my friend,are also the best example of someonewho has applied the learning of livinglife in all dimensions of life.On that note, Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
