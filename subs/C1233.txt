Aditya, one thing that I want to insert,and you will have to help me do that isthe following:It is important to know thatthe biggest disadvantage ofCoffee Can investingis that it can only see the past data,of course, it cannot predict the future.So we are looking at the growth ofthe revenue for 5 years,ROE for 5 years,ROCE for 5 years,but that doesn't meanthat those things will be correctin the next five years or not.We don't know!That is why you would want to keepbetting on large companies,and that is why you would want to keeplooking at that portfolio every year,despite the fact that you have plannedto invest it for the next 10 years.Ok, that's enough.
