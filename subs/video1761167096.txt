Awesome!Also make you spotlight, perfect!Thank you so much Radhika for joining me.It's such a pleasure to have you,especially at a momentwhere your book Limitlessis rocking the charts,and for the right reasons.We will speak about the book as well,but I wanted to spend timewith you today trying to understandyour relationship with money.You would have hada personal relationship with money,you are also a professionalwho manages money,not just of yoursbut of millions of other people.So my first question to you is,growing up and that too ina diplomat family,traveling across continents,and so on,what were your early impressionsof money and how did you thinkabout money in general?This is a really interesting questionand one I must tell you Ankur,not many people know about diplomats,so people assume,especially on social media, etc.,that I come froma very privileged background.Whenever I talk about strugglesor anything, they think,'Oh, privileged diplomatic background!'And I don't deny, I mean my fatherworked for the government.You know the one thingI realized growing up Ankur,is that money is deeply relative.Nobody is rich or poor in absolute,you are rich or poor in relative.So, I will give you an example,my early years, till I wasI think 10 or 11,we were in Delhi or Pakistan,Pakistan, I was obviously too youngto remember anything of course,but in Delhi, I was goingto Delhi Public School,most people know what that's like,and everyone felt the same.You know, my father workedin government, some people'sfathers were professionals.This was the 90s, so peopledidn't really have big corporate jobs,so I was very new-thrilled about money.When I moved to Nigeria,I went to an American school,and I've said this in my talks,but everyone else was suddenlymuch richer than me.I refer to the school as'Student Of The Year'of today back in the 90s, right?So then I became very consciousabout money for the first time.I realized that there isa difference between people.There is a difference betweenwhat my classmates wearand what we wear,the number of timesthey could go on vacationand the number of timesI could go on vacation.My father was not poor in absolute,so this is not a rich kid's struggle,but money is deeply relative.That was my first actual learningabout money.And then I think my second profound onewas in Italy, which is whenI was applying abroad for college,and this is a story I tell in the book,where suddenly my counselorbecause you are applying abroad,and clearly we could not affordfull fees at that time,I think a US college educationwas about a crore then,that is not happening.So, for the first time,I started realizing that your choicescan be constricted by money,even though you are very good,you might have to makedifferent trade-offs.So, that was my firstset of relationships with moneyand that has obviously of courseevolved over the years.Wonderful!It's so true!It's very very hard to compareone's money with another,because at the end of it,people's desires, their needsare so vastly different.For some people,even lakhs of rupees seem less,and for some people,even thousands of rupeesare good enough,and it just becomes a conversationthat you don't even know.Like, what is rich is somethingthat you never know.But a question that I often ask is,While growing up,a lot of people wish that one daythey would have lakhsand crores of rupees,and then I would do this and that,so while growing up,did you also have some sort ofa number in your mind,that if you havethis much money in life,then your life will be set?No, I didn't have a number,but my mom tells me,I used to say thatwhen I grow upI want to be rich and famous.I didn't really understandthe meaning of rich and famousat that time,but when people used to ask me,what do you want to bewhen you grow up?I didn't really havea passion or hobby,that I want to becomea doctor or engineer,but I used to say thatI want to be rich and famous,and probably this iswhat we are taught.So I didn't have a numberwhile growing up.Since my father was in the government,we had very little corporate exposure.His world was the public sector,and the rest of the worldwas private-sector.Is no differentiationin the private sector.And I must tell you thatwhen I got my first internshipat Microsoft, and my father heardthat I was earning around $5,000 a monthfrom that internship,that was probably more thanwhat he was earning at the peakof his career as a diplomat.So I felt rich and famous,because of the background I came from,I got rich very early, not famous though.I know, I so relate to that,when I went to the US formy PhD Radhika,you get a stipend for teachingother students in the formof a teaching assistantship,and I used to get $1500 per monthat that time, which was far morethan what my dad ever earnedin his life per month,and suddenly as a student,someone was giving me money to study,so it was a wild wild time,and I can so relate towhat you are saying.And do you remember yourfirst job Radhika what was it?I will tell you about my first job.So I studied in the financial college,and I did a lot of campus jobsat that time for some of my expensesbecause everything was very expensiveon the campus, even books were $200-300,and buying clothes,everything was very expensive.So, first I was a lab assistantin the computer lab,I used to help there a little bit.Then in the second year sinceI was a good student,I became a teaching assistant,and I used to get $15 per hour,it was an hourly wage which wasa lot of money,if you do it for 10 hours,that was actually quitea bit of money,and my first real job wasin Microsoft which I didin my second year.Nice! Awesome!And what did you do with yourfirst salary,whether it was a lab assistant one,or TA, or the Microsoft one?I'll tell you, I just spentmy first few salaries on my expenses,and this is probably a mistake,because we were studying on a loan,and my father used to paya certain amount for the education,and some of it was on loan,and I wanted that the amounthe was paying every year got less,but I should tell you somethinginteresting which I also coverin the book.Ankur, the first luxury purchasethat I did, was after gettinga job in Mackenzie and Wall Streetin 2005-6, because by then,there was no more college burden,so there was some freedom,and you can spend money only then,I think you can enjoy moneyonly when you are mentally free,so I made that purchase in 2006.Was it an experiencelike Louis Vuitton's 'Bagwati'?Yes, it was Louis Vuitton's'Bagwati' experience.I love that story.Please tell that story to my audience.Ok, let me tell you.So, this was in 2006,I was working for one year,and I had gone to meet a friendfor lunch, and I was carryinga leather bag worth $10,and when she saw me, she said,'You are working on Wall Street,what are you carrying?And I felt quite good about my $10 bagbecause I am a little bit ofa penny pincher at heart even today.Then I said,'What should I do?'She said,'You should go to Louis Vuittonand buy a handbag.'And I had never heard any of thisbefore but my pride was insulted.I think money is related to pridein a big way.So after that lunch,literally the moment that lunch finished,that girl went away,I straight off went tothe Louis Vuitton showroom,and I did not buy justany Louis Vuitton bag,I bought the most expensiveLouis Vuitton bag.It's not like I just boughtsome Louis Vuitton bag,it was called Epi Leather,it was for $1400,and that bag was like,there was another bagto carry that bag,like you know there arefor the expensive handbags,and I walked out with that black bag,feeling very powerful,and I think after some timeI told my mother that I boughta Louis Vuitton, she didn't understand,then gradually I could bring myselfto tell her the cost of it,and my full family in North India,Australia, Canada, everyone knewabout the cost of that bag.And when I would go home,when I would go to Delhi to traveland meet people, they would say,'That $1400 bag! Don't touch it!Don't look at it!'True 'Bagwati' experience!True 'Bagwati' experience!What were you able to tellthe actual price to your mother,because it's quite commendableif you did that?No, I told her, I took my time.And then my mother with great pride,told everybody, my auntsin Australia and that bagwas really looked after.After a point, my husband used to joke''I wish I was that bag,because of the great treatmentthat bag gets,even I don't get it.'Do you still have that bag?I still have that bag,I tweeted that bag,it's sitting there,I tried to let my mother use it once.Ankur I said,'Now I am bored of it mom,you can keep it.'She said,'I won't be able to use it.'I remember, this happened to mewhen I got some money in my life,and I always wished to buy Nike shoes,because those are the best athletic shoes,so I bought Nike shoes for myself,and when I bought them,my parents asked me,'How much are they for?'So I bought the cheapest ones,because at that time,that was what I could afford,so there for â¹1000.That itself was big because,at that time, Bata shoesfor â¹100-150 were available.And I remember one dayI proposed to my dad,'You go for a walk every day,why don't you buy Nike shoes?'So his instant reaction was,'I will never be able to wearshoes worth â¹1000,I can only keep them on my head.'I think gifting something toIndian parents isthe hardest challenge.It's far easier to buildan asset management company,running millions of dollarson assets and their managementthan trying to gift your parents,and them being gracious about it.Because they were born ina very different India, Ankur dude!My father says, and he is very goodat these global statements,that he was born in Indiawhere there was scarcity,they had to struggle for eventhe smallest things,and let go of even the smallest wishes.We are still born in an abundant India,and a generation ahead of us,of course, is very different.Their times were very different,so I agree it is hard to gift thema fancy watch.I mean what I had gifted my parentson their 25th anniversary,which was my first gift to them,they still have kept that stuff.Wow!And that just shows true parentsand wonderfully so.Radhika, did you ever reacha point where you felt thatyou got enough money,probably you don't need to workfor money now?You know I am answeringthis question right beforemy bonuses and increments,so I hope this video releases after that.I think I have hada very funny relationship.Right now, I am at a pointwhere I am financially very comfortable.I'll tell you, my graph has beena little weird because I madea lot of money on Wall Streetin my job from 2005-9,but after that, I came to Indiaand became an entrepreneur.I have mentioned some of itin my book as well, but in that phase,I went from here money to here money.Ankur, I literally went to livingin a one-bedroom housethat we could not invite anybody to,because it was so damn small.And remember what I told you,money is relative.All my classmates from Whartonwere industrialists' kids.And when we used to live in the US,we were all alike, we all usedto buy Subways, eat at the same place,all of that.When I came back to IndiaI realized there is a big income gap.I was an entrepreneur, and I madea lot of personal finance mistakesas well in my 2005-10 phase,so I had that phase.Then, of course, we sold the company,and you know now I have been workingas a CEO, now things are comfortable,now I will tell you, I am at a pointwhere money matters,but I would not change a jobjust because someone's payingme more money, there are other thingsthat matter far more.It's not that I don't want good moneyor I don't want to be paid fairly,all that is important,but I will not take a steponly because of money.That's so true!I so relate to that as well, wonderful!And your reference to personal finance,you made a lot of mistakesbetween 2005 to 2010 despiteearning so much,could you tell us a bitabout those mistakes, Radhika?Yes, I think I am talking about thisalso because you are boundto make mistakes with personal financeand there is nothing wrong with it.So what I did was I started earningin 2005, and I started investingin 2006-7, and I had investedall my money in equities,and that was a great timeif anybody remembersthe period of 2006-7.And somebody advised me that,'You are here, you have a long career,invest everything in equity.'And then came 2008, and everybodyknows what happened in 2008.The thing that is unique inour profession Ankur, is naturallya very high-risk profession.See, in a good year, everything is good.In a bad year,in an asset management company,the NAV of mutual funds goes down,your bonus goes down,you get compensation in stock,the stock price goes down,and you double all thisbecause my husband wasin the same situation,he worked for Goldman Sachs.If my husband was a doctor perhapsthis would be very different,so suddenly our portfoliois down 50%, and this isa middle-class personwho has just saved.And then what happened in 2009,we decided to come back to India,and we have to redeem all that moneyat not very high valuations.So that has been my biggestpersonal financial learning of my life.One, don't listen to people,'You are 25 years oldso invest everything.'There are no rules to it.What works for you works for you.I think the decision-makingof two very high-risk professionals,and two other 25-year-old peoplewho are maybe doctors,there life is not linkedto the market,their life is different.And the second thing I learnedwas that there are different thingslike equity, and debt.You learn all these things in college,I was a finance student,and I am from one ofthe best business schools,but till the time you don't applyand experience these things,you don't get the actual earnings.Absolutely! It's so so so true!Personal finance is somethingwhere someone may teachyou as much as possible,but you will never be ableto learn about the mistakes,because you learn fromyour own mistakes only.I so agree with that.I also remember I graduatedfrom a business school in 2006.Same time.That was the peak, it was crazy,there were jobs left, right,and center, money was being thrown,the market had gone crazy,so everyone thought,nothing will go wrong now,and then within 2 yearseverything was just crashinglike it had never before.The one thing this professionhas taught me is balance.I always say don't leta bull market get to your head,don't let a bear marketget to your heart.That is what I keep tellingmy team as well,don't be too happy or too sad.But the thing in India is,there's a saying in UP,Either in rail or in jail!We are very extreme,extremely emotional people.So the best thing this industryhas taught me is to live lifein a balance.Absolutely!I am curious how do youinvest your money today?First of all, I do very simple thingswhich might surprise people.I invest most of my money in mutual funds.I do not invest in direct stocks,because I don't have the time,and I really like mutual funds,I think it really works for me.Most of my money goes intoa conservative fund which iscalled a balanced advantage fund,I have mentioned it in Limitlessas well.But it is a fund that hassome equity and some debt.So for my profession,for my personal life,even my husband's profession,this is absolutely right.And then I invest some moneyinternationally,in US and China markets,and some of it insmall-cap and mid-cap.I invest through SIPs Ankur,because I am salaried,so I get a salary every month,and from our post-tax savings,we target a certain amountto be invested, and to date,we haven't canceled any SIP,that is is what,we are real believers.I think the simplicity of thisis just powerful,because once you startwitnessing the compounding effectof this over a long term,very few things can beatthe power of this.Great!I think this is justa wonderful message,and you have been trueto your own professionand also true to the simplicityof how investing works.Radhika, I'm curious to knowwhether you have any thoughtsabout crypto?First of all, I am trolleda lot because of my thoughtson crypto,and I think after this show again,I will be trolled a lot.But I do not invest in crypto,I know people have differentperspectives, but quite franklyI do not understand it,and I invest only in those thingswhich I can understand,and where I have absoluteregulatory clarity.This is my perspective,I don't understand it.It's like besides my primary house,I do not invest in real estate,I don't understand it.So I like to do very simple things.Ankur, I think life isas it is very stressful,I should not be stressedbecause of money.That is one principle overthe last 3-4 years.I see a lot of my colleagues,as it is our profession isso demanding, it is so demandingto manage people's money,when the market goes down,so many people and media is after you,the last thing you want isthat your personal moneyshould give you stress,and this happens a lot in our industry.So I try to keep my lifevery very simple.It's so so so powerfulwhat you just said.I often tell peoplewhat is the use of that investmentthat would give them sleepless nights.You will be scared,what if the government bans it,what if you lose the money,what if you are cheated,it's useless, right?Because at the end of it,you are growing this moneyfor your own happinessand mental balance,and if that only goes away,then no investment will everbe worth it.I always say that you are notmaking money for some contest.Ankur has to earn more than Radhikaor Radhika has to earn morethan somebody else.You make money for your own happiness,for a better life, for goals,for all of that, so whatever gives you,and there is no judgment, right?If someone else does crypto, it is ok,but you have to do what worksfor your personality, I feel.Absolutely! So true!Among all these things Radhika,my question to you iswhat part of your success,and you undoubtedly had a wonderful,I am so impressed by the factthat at the age of 39,you are so young,you still have a wonderful lifeahead of you,you have achieved pinnaclesthat people wouldn't ever getin their lifetime,and all of that has not been easy.After reading your book,it was very evident that youhave had a life that has taughtyou a lot of hard lessonsalong the way.What part of your life's successwould you attribute to luck,something which you can't reallyexplain and thus have categorizedas maybe it was luck?You know I think life isa combination of chance and choiceand all of it comes together.I think nobody gets a perfect opportunity.Life keeps giving you chances,and it's up to you to makethe best of those chances.There is some amount of luck,some amount of hard work,and some amount of,you know I am old school,and if you have read my bookyou would know thatI am slightly filmy too,there is a dialogue by Shahrukh Khan,'Tried to get you so desperately,that every particle conspiredto join you and me.'I also think, the universealso conspires to make yousucceed in life, and that isI think my belief in luck.It's wonderfully put!I remember reading this inyour book Limitless,where you were describingyour experience after youhave been getting rejectionsback to back, and suddenly youwere in Mackenzie which isthe place to be for consulting firms,and as luck would have it,the person opposite to youwas interested in bridgewhich was somethingyou also used to follow,and according to what you narratedof that experience,your interview was a full conversationon a card game,without any discussionabout what do you do,what grades do you have,and all of that.And I found that fascinating!In so many cases, I sold my businessto a company called Edelweiss,they didn't havea large mutual fund business.One day they wanteda mutual fund business,they couldn't get a CEO,I joined, so at the age of 32,I got the opportunity to becomea CEO, so this is luck.There are a lot of instanceslike these.A lot!I want to go to one episode of 2018,where you have mentionedthat Captain Raghu was takingthis storytelling exercise workshop,and that is where your brilliantbrilliant talk,'Girl with a broken neck'was recorded.And you've shared,which I didn't know of,I used to think that you didshare this story earlierbut it seems that was the first timeyou publically sharedyour insecurities,your difficulties,your apprehensionsof being who you are,and I would love for you to shareit with the audience thathow did that change you?Because I'm certain it haschanged you in so many ways.One thing is experienceand then sharing that experiencewhich is so vivid.It has been definitive,and my parents say this.People who know me now,they may not believe it,I was a very shy person,and I am not at all self-confident.I was a good studentbut I was afraid of talkingto people, you will findsuch stories in Limitless.I was very conscious of my looks.Till the age of 30, I usedto dread getting pictures clicked,that is how I was,I was convinced that I was ugly,and that is just how I was,and I haven't told many peoplethis story.And I did this talk,I had so little confidencethat I did this talk becauseI trusted Captain Raghu.I didn't even tell my husband,not even my parents thatI am about to give a talk.And they didn't know this storyin completion.Like my husband knows of some parts,my parents know few parts,so when they saw it,even they were shocked.People say that aftergiving this talk,I got a lot of public benefits.The most benefit I had wasthe internal benefitbecause I just let go of the baggage,I was relaxed, I was like,'I am good as I am!'Now if somebody trolls meabout anything, I can take on the troll,I'm not scared anymore,so the confidence and fearlessnessthat I had in my childhood,I got that back.I even say this book is a bookabout finding self-confidence,because my journey is a journeyof finding self-confidence,so I think admitting one's flaws,talking openly,I have that in your talks also,you don't do it for anyone,you do it for yourself.Actually!It's almost like,I love one thing that you saidwhich was I wasn't speakingto anybody, I was actuallyspeaking to my own self,and the best speakersthat I know of,and I have heard youspeak live as well,are very rarely speaking tosomebody.They are genuinely speakingto themselves, there just happensto be an audience in front of them,and you cannot that level ofconnection anywhere else then.And I love this one quotethat you have writtenin the book which is,Authenticity travels fartherthan we estimate and stayswith people longer than we imagine.I'm a big fan of authenticity,because I feel people carryso many fake personasand fake identities in this worldand they spend their entire lifetrying to live that identity,that if you are just truly yourself,then you don't have to think about,'How was I with this person?What did I say?I will have to recall how to behave.'You are just your own selfand the little that I've knownyou from a distance,your content that you share on LinkedIn,on Twitter, and in talksthat you engage, I've alwaysfound consistency in there.Like it's almost like,I know and this is happeninglive as well,you are not a different person ever,and that just feels so wonderful.Did authenticity come naturallyto you Radhika,or is it something that youhad to work on?Did that talk change that about you?Talk us through that.It totally changed after the talk.I was born in an environmentwhere I was told,my father was in the government,a diplomatic household isa very formal household,you know my impression wasthat when you are a leader,a CEO, you are in a corner office,you are distant from people,you don't talk about yourself,so this talk changed everythingbecause you know...I will tell you one thing,after the talk,when prospective interview candidatesused to come to meet me,and they don't know me, right?They used to tell me their storiesin the first interview itself.Somehow, they feltthat I connect with them.Girls call me and message me,and their questions arenot about their career,you know the most common questionthat I get when I talk toa young girl is,what kind of person should I marry?Wow!And it tells you what womenare thinking about,ambitious women are thinking!But that is the strange connectthat people feel to you,without knowing you.And as I said, I've also realizedthat when you are authentic,when you have nothing to hide,you lead a much easier life.And in today's world,you have much more knowledgeabout social media than I,but there is such a push.If you go on Instagram,it will seem everyonehas a perfect marriage.On Twitter, it will seem everyoneis earning from a portfolio.On Facebook, it would seem everyoneis having a perfect vacation.This is actually the world we are in,and the reality is,that it is not like that.Every day I have conversationswhere I tell my team members,'It is ok to have a bad day.It is ok to not like your boss.'I actually tell people,Do you think everyone lovestheir boss every day?That's not possible!So I think that has helped,and I think we need to haverealistic conversations in lifeand in offices.That is so true!Life will be so simpleif you stop covering upor showing off thingsbecause you are just who you are.Awesome!One last question beforewe end Radhika.Most of my audience is between18 to 24 years old,and they have rarely had any formaltraining around money.It is something that they recognizeas important for life.Two tips for them fromyour own experience,not just as someone who has managedher own money,but is now managing millions ofother people and of course their own.I think it's hard to put itinto two tips, but I would saya few things Ankur.One is to start saving.It is a consumerist world,start saving but spendsome of it as well.I apply the rule of 80:20.Save 80%, but I also boughta Louis Vuitton bag so moneyshould also be enjoyed,so find that balance ofsaving and spending.And secondly, people like youare doing this very well,learn a bit about money.Don't take randomdecisions based on tips.Learn about it, understand it,then manage it and make mistakes,evolve, etc., but be informed.Be an informed investor,don't do something becauseyou heard it somewhere.I think that's brilliant advicebecause, beyond the technicalsof where to invest and how to invest,these are two larger principles.First of all, you haveto invest consistently,like that has to be a discipline,and do it in a mannerwhere you understand money,like how does it work,how does it work for you!What is your risk appetite?And I love what you said,this is what has happenedin the last two years.When the market was going up,everybody was happy!'Oh wow! Look all is well,this is the best!'Now when the market is going down,everybody is scared.Maybe the next 1-2 yearsare going to be even more difficult,so there will be more fear,and that is actually when most peoplemake the best returns.When markets are downand under representative of the valuethat they have,and smart investors enter at that point,and not-so-smart investors move out.Don't make that mistake.Not suggesting that you shouldtime the market,but please understandhow your risk appetite plays outover the long term.Wonderful!Thank you so much, Radhika!Thank you for the book!I absolutely loved it!I would recommend this toevery single person,particularly people in their 20sbecause this book has so much,which if you know in your early life,from the experiences and mistakesand learnings that Radhika has madeand gone through in her life,you will only thank her and bless her,because this is like literallyfor the cost of a pizza,somebody's wonderful lifehand-delivered to you in a mannerthat you will never get otherwise.Thank you for writing the book,thank you for sharing your story,and thank you for being outthere despite sucha hectic demanding professionyou have.I am a big fan, and I wish youabsolutely the bestin everything you do.Thank you Ankur,and all the same goes to you.You are doing an amazing jobwith finance content and life content,so it was just a delight to do this.Thank you so much!All the best Radhika!Bye-bye!Thank you!
