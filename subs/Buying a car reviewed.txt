How to buy a car?Should I rent a cab?Or buy a car?Or rent a car? Let's see through the Excel sheet. Let's play with Excel.First of all, setup.All the green cells can be changed by you at any point. This sheet in factwill be in the pinnedcomment and description.So, you can click on it.You won't be able to use this sheet.Download it anduse it as much as you want.So, first of all,what is the time frame foranalysing this decision? I have assumed 5 years.Then, every month, on an average,how much do you travel in a car,weather it is Ola/Uber,your own car, or a rented car?I have assumed 2,000 km.What is the inflation? 6%. And the cost of capital,let's assume it 6% as well.It means thatthe money whichyou could have invested somewhere,what will you earnafter investing it?And we are assuming thatthe basic fixed deposit can be made by anyone. No thought needs to be put into it.No need to investin the stock market.So, let's assume 6%. It could be anything.Actually, let's assume 7%but it won't matter a lot.You will get to know.Then, buying a car.So, we are buying a car.Which car are we buying?This is also a decision.So, we have assumed that we are buying a car for â¹10,00,000. Actually, let's check theprice of Swift Dzirebecause Ola/Uber usually send a Dzire.So, Dzire cost on road. Let's check the on-road price. City, I am assuming for New Delhi butyou can be anywhere else.So, let's assume South Delhi.Andthis is the cost.So, â¹6,50,000.So,let's go and add â¹6,50,000.Then, what are the taxes and insurance?And taxes and insurance are â¹52,000 plus â¹34,000.So, around â¹86,000.Then, rate of interestif we take a loan, because we are taking a loan, what would it be?Let's see.Car loan interest rate,how much is it? 8.8%.Let's assume it.8.8%. And the duration of our loan. So, we have assumed 3 years. What will be the down payment? It is usually 20%. So, 20%.What will be themaintenance cost of the car? So, on an average, 2% of the actual value of the car.The value of the cardepreciates every year.So, the maintenancecost also depreciates and this is on an annual level. What will be the insurance cost? Let's assume it 2% as well.And depreciation, meaning at whatpercentage will the value ofthe car decrease every year.I have assumed 15%. Now, this can differ. So, you could say, âIt will be 10% for a Maruti.âOkay. Let's assume 10%. What is the mileage of the car? So, let's see the mileageof this same car.So, a Swift Dzire,and it has a milage of 22 km,but it is the ideal case.Let's assume 18 km.Okay. Cost of petrol, what is it today? Let's assume â¹100.Driverâs salary,why is it here?It is here because Ola/Uberhave drivers.Now, you could say, âIf I ambuying a car, I willbe driving it myself.â So, I will assume it as zero.So, we will begin with zero.Parking cost is important.Why? Because we are makingapples-to-apples comparison.There is no parkingcost in Ola/Uber.You can get the cab from the app, cancel it from the app,and thatâs how it works.But parking cost isincluded for your own car,which we have assumedâ¹1,500 per month.You can enter youractual cost here as well.Then, what if we rent a car?So, we rent the same car. I donât know how many of you knowthat a lot of companies now have a subscription plan. For example, Maruti Subscribe.What happens in this is,you pay a monthly fee and now,you donât have to do anything to maintain that car.Your insurance willbe paid by the company,your maintenance will be paid by the company, it will be regularly serviced, so on and so forth.You donât have to payan upfront amount. So, you donât need a loan,you donât need tomake a downpayment, you donât need to pay tax.You get a white number plate.Itâs not like you geta taxi number plate. So, it is your car by nature,but you have not purchased it.You will use it by payinga monthly subscription fee.You need to make a commitment. For example,we will try to buy a Dzire.So,Dzire is here.We will buy Dzire for 5 years because the analysis period is 5 years, and LXI,which we searched for,basically that is our car.So, lets click on it.And it has an annualkilometre package,and because we have assumed 2,000 km per month,we will select the20,000 km planwhich costs â¹17,900.So, if you pay â¹17,900 every month, then Maruti will give you a car which will be almost brand new, or actually brand new.You donât need to payfor its insurance,or maintenance cost.Just the cost of using itlike petrol, driver, parking. All the other costsare included in this subscription.You do not have to payany upfront amount, and it is a beautiful thing.By the way, I have boughtmy car on a subscription, a Nissan subscription,and we have bought aMagnite automatic version.We pay â¹25,000 a month for it,GST included,and that in fact seems like a great deal.You will also get to know why and how. So, â¹17,897.So, letâs go back. 5 years as it is. â¹17,897.This is your expense to rent a car,if we have rented the car as a cab. So, we used Ola/uber.It also has variable ratesfor different cities,but it is nearly â¹13 rupees.The first 2 kms,or 20 kms,are cheaper and it rises later on.There are waiting chargesand night charges. Adding all that gives usâ¹13 per km on an average.Now, letâs see how we go through thedecision. So,here is how you have tothink about this.By the way,you have seen the result.Result iseffective rate per kmif you rent a cab, it is â¹9.40. If you buy a car, then â¹11.20.If you rent a car,then â¹12.40.Now, letâs see how this happens.First of all, renting a cab. How do its financials work?So, your monthly expense is â¹26,000.Why?Because you travel2,000 km per month. You pay â¹13 per km.So, â¹26,000.Butthis is not your entire expense.There is something calledan opportunity cost. It meansthat for renting a cab, you donât have to make a downpayment,you donât have to pay insurance, you donât have to pay for parking,you donât have to pay for a driver.That all is brilliant cost, right?Saved.Now, if you invest all that moneywhenever you have to spend that money,and you earn the same 7% return, which is the return of FDs,then in these 5 years,you will earn nearly â¹4,35,000,which means your net expense of renting a cab is â¹26,000 per month times 5 yearsminus â¹4,35,000,which means nearly â¹11,25,000.And if you divide it by number of kmsover 5 years,then â¹9.40 would beyour effective cost.This is the financialof renting a cab.Of course, renting a cabhas its own problems. Sometimes, the ride isnât accepted. They donât work well in rainy season. The cars arenât clean.Safety is a concern.The challenge of not owningyour own car is there.So, there are a lot of emotionaland of course, practicalreasons as well but if you overlook them,then you can get it done for â¹9.40. Now, letâs talk about buying a car.The first cost of car,which was buying a car, was â¹6,50,000.In addition, â¹86,000 were taxes and insurance expense.Then, we need tomake a downpayment.So, our downpaymentwould be â¹2,16,000, which means 20% of â¹6,50,000plus â¹86,000 which isnot financed by loan.We need to pay it ourselves.â¹5,20,000 would be the loan amount,which would be at 8.8%.We are taking it for 3 years.So, our EMI would bealmost â¹16,500.Brilliant.So, the interest that we wouldpay over this period of 3 years, that will be â¹73,000.This is the additional costof owning the vehiclebeyond the cost of the vehicle. Correct? You bought the car for â¹6,50,000, but on top of it, you paid â¹73,000to the bank as a loan.And then you would haveadditional expenses as well.So, the maintenanceand insurance expense,which would be almost â¹1,00,000 over this 5-year period.The mileage of your car is18 km per litre as assumed.Cost of petrol is â¹100 right now.It will also keep increasing.So, over a 5-year period,for travelling 2,000 km per month,you will have to spendâ¹7,50,000 on petrol.You have assumeddriver salary as zero.Your parking cost over the 5-year periodwill be almost â¹1,00,000.So, the total cost of using your carwill be almost â¹17,70,000which means,oh, sorry,and when you would sell this car after a 5-year period,it would have a value of â¹4,26,000. So, it would be your income.â¹17,70,000 would be your expense.So, the net expenseof owning this caris â¹13,42,000.That means effectively,your per kilometre cost is â¹11.20.And finally renting a car. In renting a car, â¹17,900was our rent expense. So, over a period of time,which is 5 years,we spent almost â¹10,70,000for subscription. On top of it, the other expensesof owning a car are also there. So, the petrol expense, driver expense, parking expense. So, almost â¹19,00,000 is our total expense to own this car, sorry, to rent this car over a 5-year period. But we did not pay insurance and maintenance, and we did not make a down payment. So, this money that we saved, if we deploy it somewhere else at the same 7%, which is the basic rate of return of FDs. So, â¹2,60,000, which was our upfront cost as down payment, â¹16,000 which was our expense for insurance and maintenance over our period of time, 7% return which we can generate. So, â¹4,35,000 would be our amount, which means that the net cost of renting a car over a 5-year period is â¹14,91,000, or effective cost per kilometre is â¹12.40. And that then gives you the comparison at these three levels. Now, let's see. So, according to thisdriver expense, parking expense.So, almost â¹19,000 issorry, â¹19,00,000if only it was â¹19,000.So, â¹19,00,000 is our total expense to own this car, sorry, to rent this car over a 5-year period.Butwe did not pay insuranceand maintenance,and we did not make a down payment. So, this money that we saved,if we deploy it somewhere elseat the same 7%,which is the basicrate of return of FDs.So, â¹2,16,000, which was ourupfront cost as down payment,â¹1,06,000 which was our expensefor insurance and maintenanceover a period of time, 7% return which we can generate.So, â¹4,35,000 would be our amount,which means that the net costof renting a carover a 5-year periodis â¹14,91,000, or effective cost per km isâ¹12.40. And that then gives you the comparison at these three levels.Now, let's see.So, according to this,So, according to this,if you travel 2,000 km per month,and you want to buy a Maruti Dzire,and after consideringall these contours, then you should buy your own car,which is great. Now, let's see how this changes, basis how we change the numbers.So, lets say you do nottravel a lot by car.You travel only 1,000 kms.Your office is close to your house, or maybe you don't go to an office, whatever the case may be.So, you travel 1,000 kilometres by car. Now, when you go back,the decision becomesstill the same,but the numbers become very different.So, go back.For 2,000 km, your per km cost was â¹11,butfor 1,000 km,your per kilometrecost has become â¹16. Why? Because to drive the same car,you have spent more money.Now, because the otherexpenses are the same.the value of the car is same,so on and so forth.Now, let's considerthat you drive a lot.So, 3,000 km.And see how thenumbers change.â¹9.50.In fact, now renting a cabbecomes more expensive.So, I often say thatif you travel a lot,your house and youroffice are too far away and you need to cover the distance,you go to the office, it is not in hybrid mode,etc, etc,it may make sense for you to buy a car as against to rent a cab.Renting for you is still â¹10.40which is higher than buying the car. Now, let's look at things differently. Let's say your cost of capital is, which you assumed 7%, now becomes 10%.Basically, you take that moneyand invest it in a mutual fund.Why should you put it an FD? Because we know it will give 7%,but the worst-casescenario for a mutualfund over a periodof time of 3-5 years can give 10-12%.Let's see if that changes things. So, go back to2,000 kmand see.Now, let's change something.Suppose you wantto analyse this not for a5-year periodbut for a 3-year period,which is what I didbecause our rental is for 3 years.Itâs not for 5 years.And in these 3 years,our cost of capital, I assumed it to be 10%.Why? Because I know that Idon't want to invest in FD.I will invest it in mutual fund,and a mutual fund can give10-12% even in worst cases over a 3-year period hopefully.And so far, it's beenfar more than that.So, if we look atexactly the same thing,calculating our numbersat the same 2,000 km,you see there is a big difference.Suddenly, buying a car is â¹11.60but renting a car is â¹10.50.Of course, renting a cab is still the cheapestbut as I said, it has some cons that it is not on demand, the car is not clean,or anything else that would happen.I wanted to havethe feeling of having my own car without having my own car.So, the entire fight ofinsurance and maintenance,I have now become abstract to it.It just automatically happens.I just have to pay a subscription feeand they take care of everything,and my job now is tomaintain the driver and petrol.And this is how the number comes up. If I do the same thing for 1,000 kms. So, you don't drive a lot,then you will see the cost increases. It becomes â¹17 and â¹15.If I do it for 3,000 km,you drive a lot, then it becomesmore attractive. â¹9.70 and â¹8.90.So, reducing the periodand increasing the cost of capitalmakes renting a carmore attractive,which is why I chose that decision because we know that 3 years, meaning at the end of 2024, at the end of the next year,our subscription will end, and at that point of time,I will say,I could either rent a new carand completely go through this,or maybe buy anEV or something, right? Because the entire cost of mileage, that will completely change if you do this entire math for an EV.The other thing is also the cost of the car.So, if the same car is for â¹10,00,000,and everything else stays the same,and we calculate this for 2,000 km, then you will see What a huge difference!â¹24,062.So, I will go back to the sheet and make this â¹24,062. This then becomes the conversation.â¹13.60 for buying a car, â¹11.60 for renting a car,and â¹5.90 for renting a cab, still remains the attractive option.This is at these numbers.Now, if we change this to 6%.We don't want to take a lotof risk or do anything else,then it also becomes cheap renting a car.Why?Due to this cost of your car,the insurance and maintenance is saved and you are deploying thatto an investment.Not even an investment, you are putting it in FD. So,the more expensive a car is, it makes more sense to rentif you preserve thatopportunity cost of surplus capital and invest it in an FDor a mutual fund or anywhere else.This becomes the basic.So, this Excel sheetis a good way for you to decideshould you buy a car, rent a car,or rent a cab?And through the calculation and sheet,you can rightly,not rightly,wisely, smartly, financially,and in a prudent manner,make this decision while keeping emotions aside.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo,signing off.
