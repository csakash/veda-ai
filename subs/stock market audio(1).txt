There is no intro in this too Piyush.We'll go straight into the video.In this entire month,we will not keep any intro in any video.We'll go straight in.Let's just seewhat difference it makes to the retentionIf you want to invest in the stock market.Then, these are the seven unique waysto invest in the stock market.Number one, what is commonly calledas delivery of stocks.This is the most common formof long-term investing,where you pick a stockthrough your researchand then through a brokerage accountyou buy that stockand at the end of the day,take delivery of that stock.When that happens,the stock moves into your demat account.So as your money is storedin your bank account,your stocks are stored in a demat account.What are the pros and consof this approach?Number one.When you buy any stockafter doing your research,then you have ownership of that stockand through ityou can make a long-term investment.If you've got a stock that you knowwill grow well, is a stable company,something that I can take a bet on,for 5, 10, maybe 20 years,then that will allow for compoundingto happen and will help your money grow.But this requires research,for this analysis has to be done,technical analysis, fundamental analysis,have to understandyour company's financialsor have to be understandhow the stock price is moving.So it is a lot of effortand that's why at least my recommendationis, if you are a new investorin the stock marketthen picking stocksmay not be the right approach for you,but it remains your choice.If you want to follow this approachthen you will need a brokerage account,through which you can buy and sell stocksand a demat accountwhere you can store these stocks.Zerodha is a great exampleof a brokerage and a demat account.This video is not sponsoredby any brand that I would name.These are just brandsthat I personally use.I have been using Zerodhasince the last 7 years.It is Indiaâs number one brokerage accountand the best thing about it is,If you take delivery of the stocks,then they do not chargeany money for that.So, it's absolutely free.You buy,buy at the pricewhatever the stock price would beand then you take delivery of thatT+1 which is, 1 day after the dayyou bought it,So, on the third dayyou will have those stocksin your demat accountand then you can do whatever you want.Continue holding themor sell them or anything else.Anything else isn't possible,these are the only two options.That is how you do long-term investingthrough delivery of stocks.Itâs exact opposite,which is number two,is trading of stocks.In trading of stocks,you trade within the day.So you are not bettingon the long-term view of that stock.The price fluctuationsyou have during the day, you bet on it.Let's say a stock is worth â¹100and you feel that this â¹100will turn into 101 today,so, you will actually put in that moneyto buy that stock at â¹100.lots of themand as soon as it hits 101,you will sell those stockswithin the same day itself.What you did is, you got a profit of 1%.which is not bad at all'cause if you can do the same thing daily,which is not possible as such,But if you technically, theoreticallyare able to earn 1% every day,you will actually have 37 times more moneyat the end of the yearthen you started with.Off course, most traders,do not make money.Because it is really, really hardto predictwhether the price will go up or down,and it requires very active vigilance.So, the biggest prois that you can earn moneywithin a day itself.You don't have to wait a really long time.But its biggest conor its biggest disadvantage,is that it requires active research.and you have to sit in front of the screenand make that happen.Definitely not somethingwhich I would recommenda new investor to start with.It is very easyto get trapped in its greed.There are many people,whose lakhs and crores of rupeesgo into this.I would not want you to be one of them.Which is why, please start itonly when you are knowledgeable,are research oriented,you have the expertiseto do it with your own money.With your own money,start with a very small amount.Only when you become confident,do you increase that amount.And definitely,don't take someoneâs else moneytill you get to this point.That is option number two,on how to invest in the stock market.No, before that, let's say this.Also, to do this trading,a demat account and a brokerage accountwill be required.Demat account is not very important anywaybecause you are never taking a delivery,but a brokerage account is a must.Also, this is charged.so Zerodha, for example,let me just very quickly check,charges flat â¹20or 0.03%, whichever is lower.So, if you have traded for â¹100,imagine if you traded for â¹100,then it will charge you â¹20 for that tradeand that will become your cost of tradingwithin that day.If you do delivery, like I told, is zero,so it doesnât charge any amount for that.Third option.Investing in stock marketis something that we all are familiar withand those are called mutual funds.What are mutual funds?There is a bank or an institutionwhere there will be a mutual fund manager.One such personthat focuses on a specific idea.It could be about the Sensex.It could be about an industry,pharma, technology, agriculture, all this.It could be about specific needs.I want to focus on growth.I want to focus on dividend, so on,and they will then gatherthrough their researcha portfolio of stocks.So donât bet on one stock,they bet on multiple stocks,and they will manage that for you.So you don't have to goand buy those stocks individually.You just buy a unit of the mutual fund.Mutual fund charges you a fee,which is called the expense ratioand with that expense ratio,it runs the entire machineryin the back-end,research, which stocks to buy,which ones to sell.All this happenswithout any of your involvementand what you get is the risein the unit value of the mutual fundwhich is called NAV,net asset value.This NAV is the equivalentof the stock price.So, if the stock price of Relianceis â¹2200,but the NAV of a mutual fund is â¹100,you assumethat both these things are the same.You buying a mutual fund stock worth â¹100or buying a Reliance stock worth â¹2200,there is no difference as such,but the big difference is,here you are buying a Relianceâs stockand that is a stock.so, when Reliance goes up,your money will go up,if it goes down, money will go down.But in mutual funds,you are buying a portfolio of stocks.So if, god forbid,one of the stocks goes down,there is still enoughand more in the remaining stockswhich might still keep you up even then.That's why a portfolio approachor a diversified approachis a very safe wayof a new investor coming into the market.That is why Mutual fundsare highly promoted."Mutual Funds Sahi Hai,"we often see its ads,and there is a reason why,it is because, mutual funds are a good wayof entering the market.Itâs risky even now,it's not that your moneywill never go down.It will definitely go.Because the stock market by designis a volatile market.Sometimes down, sometimes up.Sometimes down, sometimes up.But what you're doingthrough a portfolio of stocksand the right mutual fund,you are diversifying that riskor mitigating that risk.If you don't know anythingabout mutual funds,then a good mutual fund to start withwill be an index mutual fund.This is one such mutual fund,which tries to replicate our entire indexwith either the Bombay Stock Exchangeor the National Stock Exchange.A good index mutual fundis the Nifty 50 Index Mutual FundIt replicates the top 50 stockson the National Stock Exchange of India.So, it says thatthese are the top 50 stocks.These companies are really good.Large enough.Has good growthover a long period of time.Itâs top 50,so there is this stable growth as well.So, Iâll bet on them.So, the Nifty 50 Index Mutual Fundis a good, good way to start.If you do its SIP,then you remain committed as an investorover a long period of time.And to give you sense,In the last 5, 10, 15 years,the Nifty 50 has given, on an average,an annual return of 13% to 14%.Meaning, your moneyhas almost doubled every 5 years.So if you had put that money for 15 years,So, in the first 5 yearsyour â¹100 became 200,or your â¹1 turned into â¹2.Then in the next 5 years that 2 into 4and then in the next 5 yearsthat 4 into 8.Means eight times the money in 15 years.That is the power of compounding,which is somethingthat you should experience.You also need a demat accountto buy mutual funds.It doesnât necessarily needa brokerage account.A good way to buy mutual funds,what I personally use,is Coin by again Zerodha.Coin is absolutely free.Whenever you buy a mutual fund,you have two options.One direct way and one regular way.The regular way is,what our parents are used to.Where you used to buy mutual fundsthrough an agent,But because you are buyingthrough a person,So, you'll have to pay their expenses too.So, your expense ratio,which is the amountyou paid to the mutual fundto run their company, is higer.Because it also involvesthe commission of that agent.Direct way is better than regular way.In the direct way,you donât buy through any agent,buy through a platform like Zerodhaand you buy straightfrom the mutual fund itself.Your expense ratio is less in this.And thatâs why, it is a better wayof managing it.The better part,an additional part is, Zerodhadoesn't charge anything for this purchase.So, the transaction is also free,expense ratio is also lower,and thatâs why it is a good wayto approach it.You can also do SIP.Itâs become a bit complicatedBecause SEBI has put a lot of rules, etc.of SIP online.But still, please be diligent,please be disciplinedand activate your SIP mutual fund.Because investing the same amounton the same date every monthis the most guaranteed wayof creating wealthover a long period of time.Let me tell a bit about expense ratio.They're usually in Index Mutual Fund's,they are usually in the rangeof 0.2 to 0.3%.Means if you invest â¹100,So, your â¹99.8 or â¹99.7 is investedin the marketand the remaining 20 or 30 paise,is used by the companyto run its expenses.That's the only thing you have to bear.There are also some mutual funds,which have an exit load.Exit load means,if you sell that mutual fundbefore any period,then you have to pay that exit load.Ideally you should choosesuch a mutual fundwhere the exit load is zero or is minimal.Some very good mutual fundshave an exit load.Typically, about six months or a year.Which should be the case as it is,before 6 months to a year,you should not sell any mutual fund,Because in that short periodyou will not have any movement or growth.It will only happenover a long period of time.Then the fourth wayof investing in the stock marketare called ETFs.This is a recent phenomenon in India.ETF stands for Equity Traded Funds.So, when you buy mutual funds,you buy a unit of mutual fund,which is NAV.But if you want to sell that mutual fundthen you have to sell that unit again.and it is not traded on the market.You are buying or selling directlyfrom the mutual funds.Itâs like a shop,but imagine, like stocks,if these mutual funds could be traded.Means, you can trade them even in a day,like a traderor you can take a long-term delivery,like a long-term investor,and that is what ETFs allow.ETF gives an option to trade a fundon the stock market itself.So, like you buy stocks of a company,similarly, you can buy ETFs of a fund.that is in my knowledgethe biggest differenceand perhaps the only differencebetween an ETF and a mutual fund.But there is also a bigger,better difference.ETFs, in general,are much cheaper than mutual funds.So, to give you a sense,if you remember the expense ratioof mutual funds is 0.2 to 0.3%.The expense ratio of an ETFis around 0.5 or 0.1%.So almost half or one-fourthand that makes it even better,if you want to take the same fund,but instead of buying its mutual fund,you buy its ETFMy understanding is,there is no other difference.If I am incomplete in my understanding,then please tell me in comments section,what is the differencebetween ETFs and Mutual Funds?My understanding tells methat ETFs and mutual fundsconverge at some pointand the only big difference is,the trading of ETFsand of course, the expense ratio,Which is very low in ETFs.You need a demat account to buy ETFsin addition to that brokerage account,from where you can buy them.Because you may take deliveryof that unlike a mutual fundWhere you can storeit in an app like Coin.Then number five.The way to invest in stock market,is smallcase.I have talked about smallcase quite often.So, what do mutual funds do?Mutual funds by focusingmostly on an index or an industry,build and give you a portfolio of stocks.Smallcase takes this a step further.It says,what if there is a different thesisthat you believe in?For example,you feel that middle class Indiais growing very fast.Which is actually a fact.So those companies,which are making somethingfor middle class India,I want to invest in those companies.Unfortunately, that is not a mutual fundthat exists.But smallcase allows for that.Because smallcasethrough smallcase managers,The same peoplewho are probably running the mutual funds,or independent finance professionalswho are certifiedand are allowed to make these,They make a smallcase.And you follow that smallcase.So, what it does is,it connects the smallcasewith your brokerage account,it can be anything.It can be Groww, can be Upstox,can be Zerodha, or any other,and you buy and sell through smallcase.At no point will smallcasehold ownership of these stocks.You will have it, in your demat account.But the best thing is,it allows for you to, one,track an idea which could be on smallcaseand number two,get 100% ownership of the stocks.So, as those stocks change,Like it happens in a mutual fund,maybe every month,every three months, every six months,accordingly, you adopta re-balance approachwhere through a single clickyou refresh all the stockswhich were in your portfoliothrough that smallcase.I have made many videos on smallcase.A particular videowhich I would like to share,Which is how smallcase worksand what is the cost of that,is something that you should watch.It's definitely a great approach.I have personally taken two smallcaseson something called momentum strategy.Momentum strategyis where a stock keeps on risingbefore it begins to falland that momentum,on the short-term momentum.you take the bet.Now that is not somethingwhich I have an expertise on,nor do I have any understanding.But there are two such companies,or there are two such investorswho do it with great skillsand I follow their smallcase,Capitalmind and WeekendInvesting.And through them,whatever suggestion they give me,which happens every week,I replicate that suggestionwith a single click on smallcase,on my demat accountand continue to enjoy the benefitsof momentum strategy.Number six, is called F and Oor futures and options.If I were to ask this to everyone,in the stock market of India,if â¹100 is traded every daySo how much of that are deliveries?Means long-term investing,which I am explaining,and how much is trading?Where there is no delivery.It is just simply buy, sell, buy and sell.Youâd be shockedthat over 90% of it is just tradingand very low percentageis actually delivery.Futures and options are the biggest wayshow people actually get involvedin the stock market.Not something that I would recommend,but it is important to know and understandbecause futures and optionsare such a big playin almost all the markets, not just Indiathat you will be left incompletein your knowledgeIf you didn't know about it,I have made a very detailed videoabout futures and options.But to give you a sensethat how does it really work,there are essentially two thingsyou need to know.One, whatâs called a Call Option.Second, whatâs called a Put Option.Call option is whereI can buy a stock in the futureThat is the right that I have,but not an obligation.This means I have a choice,at a certain point, in the future,to buy this stockat a certain price or not,There is no obligation.And a Put Option is,that I have the choice,whether or not to sell this stockat a future date at a certain price.Again, there is no obligation.Now why do people tradein Futures and Options, is because,for a value much, much, much lowerthan the actual stock price,you get options to beton the price movement of that stock price,which are Call or Put.to understand that look at the screen.Letâs pick up Reliance,So, this is the current price of Reliance,2549 and 60 paise.This is on the National Stock Exchange.Here you can see the optionsand the options are very interestingThis is Call Optionand similarly there is also a Put Option.What was the Call Option?That you can buy this stock.What it says is, that if you pay â¹64.95,then you get the optionon the 24th of November,which is about a month from now,to buy this stock for â¹2040.How much is it now? 2549.Means people are sayingthat you can buy Reliance stockon this date at this price.Now as the price changes,similarly, its price will also change.For example, if I say,that I want to buy this stock for â¹2160,then there is nothing,there is no option around that at all,because at such a low price,most likely, nothing will happen.Let's increase,I say, on 24th November,I want to buy this same Reliance stockfor â¹2620 and that is only for â¹30,Now, why has it decreased? Why?Because people thinkthat on November 24th,which is about 24 days from now,this stock will not be of â¹2620.So, we can give at lessbecause I know,I will most likely make money from that.Similarly, Put, means sell.On 24th November,I can sell the Reliance stock at â¹2620,is an option that I need.This is quite high, â¹89.If I make this same thing 2560,which is close to the current price,then it only becomes about â¹60,Means, at this priceyou will be able to sell,because there will always be some buyerat the other end, willing to buy it.So, you see that, for the â¹2500 stock,you are getting an optionto buy and sell it at almost â¹60and thatâs why, it is so attractive.Because for a much lesser value,you get the option of trading onor betting on the price movementin the future.This November 24, December 29, January 25,these are all the dates,which are called expiry datesfor these options,and that is how the world functions.No need to be more technicalthan this for now.Because there is an entire in-depth videomade on Futures and Options,which I would encourage youto go and read.Finally, number seven.Way of investing in the stock marketare called PMSor portfolio management services.when you have lots of money,then you want some expertto manage all your money.They open a demat account for you.They invest for you.Not only in the stock market,can also invest in the debt market.You can off course do in mutual funds.Maybe even buy stocks, so on.But PMS cannot do trading.PMS can only invest.And the investing could beshort-term investingWhere for a short period,for 30 days, for 7 days, for 60 days,youâll park your money somewhere.Which many big companies do.Because they have so much moneyin the bank account,They say,even if you earn a little interestfor a short time, itâs not badand they invest for the long termfor building capital.As an individual, you can also do a PMS.PMS has regulation for Indiathat you need to invest a minimumof â¹50 lakhs per yearor I think cumulative, am not too sure,to start a PMS or enroll in a PMSThat's why there are very few peoplewho adopt a PMS in India.because it is with a very high barrier.Clearly, not somethingthat is a must for a new investorat this point.These seven methodsare the methodsfor you to enter into the stock market.If you want my opinion,then this would be my opinion,that you enter the marketthrough a mutual fund.Choose an index mutual fund.A Nifty 50 Index Mutual Fundis the right way to start,itâs SIP.And that will be when you startgetting used to the ups and downs of that.Slowly when you become a bit comfortable,where you know my heartbeatdoes not get faster due to falling price.Increase in price doesn't get me excited.That is when you get into the next order,and the next order, and the next order,and over timebuild your risk appetite with moneyand thus, your wealth as well.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
