I am a student, age 22 years,residing in India.I can read English but not speak itvery well, and I wish to learnhow to speak fluent English.Think of yourself as an English tutorand design a 30-day program for meto speak English fluently.Enter.The English Fluency Program.Friends, Chat GPT isa very powerful AI tool.AI means artificially intelligentor artificial intelligence tool.This means Chat GPT gathersall the information on the internetto answer your questions.It could be any question.For example,how to speak English fluently?And through this video,I will show you what are the stepsthat you can use chat GPT to actuallybecome superfluent in speaking English.First of all, what is Chat GPT?Chat GPT is an open software toolthat any one of us can use.You will have to go to openai.com,log in there or create accountto access Chat GPT.There is a plus or a premium versionof Chat GPT also available,but you don't need to do that at all.You will be able to access everythingthat I am also getting withoutany difference.As you saw, I asked Chat GPTthat I am a student studying in India,I am 22 years old,and I know how to read Englishbut can't speak it fluently,pretend that you are an English tutor.You are fooling Chat GPT...So you are telling Chat GPT to actlike an English tutor,and design a 30-day program for methrough which I can learnto speak English fluently.This is the responsethat Chat GPT has given,and now let's try to understand it deeply.First of all, Chat GPT says thatfor the first five days,we should build our vocabularyand grammar.Spend the first 5 days of the programfocusing on building yourvocabulary and grammar.Start by reading short articles.Watching English-language news or TV showswith English subtitles.Take note of new words and phrases,and practice them in sentences.This will help to improve your vocabulary,and get a better understandingof sentence structures.Now this is at a high level.We will make Chat GPT work more.And you can actually in thatconversation start chatting with itso that it can build.So you will say,can you build on day 1 to 5with more specific tasks and exercises?And it gives you day-wise tasks.Day 1:Start by taking up a placement testonline to identify your current levelof English proficiency.It asks you to first determinewhere you stand,which is always a good start, right?Because then a baselinewill be established,and we'll have to measure ourselvesaccordingly.Set a goal for the next 30 days,such as learning 100 new words,mastering a specific grammar rule,or improving your pronunciation.So it's according to where you stand.But my question is,start by taking a placement test onlineto identify your current level.I don't know where to find this test.So I will go and copy that.I will say,where can I find the placement testthat you've suggested I take on day 1?And it will give the answer.There are severalfree online placement tests.So there'sthe Cambridge English placement test,the EF standard English test,English Central.These are all the links.By the way, all these links arein the pinned comment and description.It is important to notethat placement tests are justa starting point,and may not provide a completelyaccurate assessment which we all know.It will broadly tell us the levelof our English-speaking capability.Great!Let's go back.So we gave this test.We have also set a goalfor the next 30 days.The goal could be,learning 100 new words,or as it suggests,learning a specific grammar rule,or improving our pronunciation.So I will choose to workon my pronunciation.There are a lot of words thatwe are not able to pronounce properly.So whether we say schedule or skedule,caff or cafe, hotl or hotel,I don't know these things.And English is anywaya very twisted language.So I actually say,I want to set a 30-day goal of improvingmy pronunciation in English.Please design the 30-day programaccordingly for me.And hence, we have this.Day 1 to 5, all this.And now I will say,elaborate on day 1 to 5 withspecific exercises and tests.And it goes here.Perfect!Now let's start.Start by listening to a recordingof a native English speaker talkingfor 5-10 minutes.So this is your day 1 exercise.You have already done your placement test,so you know the baseline of your English.Now on the first day, you will listen toa native English speaker for 5-10 minutes.You will go to YouTube,take any Ted-X talk or Ted Talk,or watch some English seriesor movie for 5-10 minutes.Take notes of any words or soundsthat you find difficult to pronounce.So you will specifically pickthose words which you find difficultto pronounce.Using online resources such asYouTube tutorialsor pronunciation apps to learnmore about the sounds of Englishand how they are produced.Ok.Day 2:Record yourself saying the wordsand sounds you find challenging.So you will say, cafe instead of caff,hotel instead of hotl, so on and so forth.Listen to your recordingand compare the pronunciation to thatof a native speaker.Native speaker is also very interestingbecause the accents also differ.There is an American accent,a British accent, an Indian accent.Like right now,I am speaking in an Indian accent.I am not talking to youin an American accentor a British accentor an Australian accent or anything else.I am talking to you inan Indian accent becausethat's the accent that I have learned.American accent becomes very different.I can't even try an American accent,now I've become very conscious.Use online resources such as Forvoor YouGlish to listen to recordingsof latest speakerssaying the words correctly.Day 3:Practice minimal pair exercises.These are words that differby only one sound,such as ship and sheep.Quite interesting, right?We often get confused by this.I have to ship something out.I saw some sheep.Or bit and bet.I bit my tongue.I bet you can't do this.I bit my tongue,or I bet you can't do this.Pronounce each pair of wordsand compare the differencein pronunciation.Use online resourcessuch as English Centralor Phonetics Focusto practice minimal pairs exercises.Now I find minimal pairs exercisesquite interesting.Give me some exercises for minimal pairsin English.And let's see.So it's all here.Create a list of minimal pairssuch as bit and bet,ship and sheep, cot and caught.Practicing each word.Then there is a learning exercise.There is a sentence completion exercise,then a word list exercise.So, give me a word list of50 minimal pairs in English.Let's see.Here it is.It has given us 50 words.Bet and bit, sell and cell.This is sellingand this is the cell in our bodiesor the battery cell.Bin and been.Bin refers to dustbin,and been means he has been to that place.Cap and cab.Cap means the cap we wear on our head,and cab is like Ola and Uber.Cat and cot.To and two.I am going to Delhi, or I have two pens.Die and dye.I am dead, or dye it in this color.Deer and dear.Deer is the animal,and dear is like Dear Ankur,I love you, thank you.I have subscribed to your YouTube channel.Fair and fare.Fair can mean light complexionor it can also mean fair for everyone,and fare means fees for ridesin a taxi or a bus or a train.Foul and fowl.One is the foul you make in football,you hit them with your foot or something.And this fowl means an animal,the jungle fowl which looks like a cock.You can Google it.Why should we Google?Let's ask Chat GPTWhat is a fowl?Fowl is a general term usedfor domesticated birds.Examples are, oh, fowl meansa lot of birds like chickens, ducks,geese, turkeys, koels, and pheasants.Ok, very interesting.So you have these 50 words.Let's go back to it.And you are seeing how this is becominglike your litral tutor.You are not clicking on any website,not looking for any links,nothing like that.It will give you all the links,it will show you all the videos.So you can say, share five linksto YouTube videos where I can learnhow to speak English fluently.Here are the 5 links.They have been selected most likely by,let's see, let's just check on that.Video isn't available anymore.Chat GPT has failed!Sorry!Not even this one!Wait, am I on Incognito?No!This can't be the case.Ok, hold on, something is wrong,let's just regenerate.Ok, here we go.Let's use thisbecause this one didn't work.And you see these.These are 5 channels that give youeverything that you need to know,how to learn English fluently?So if I click on English Lessons For You.This is the one.4.58 subscribers.English with Ronnie: EnglishLessons4UAnd it seems likea very interesting way to do that.7 ways to use of...Ronnie's top tips for teachers.Can you guess the verb?Seems interesting.So you have YouTube channels as well.But let's go all the way back.So we have done day 1 to 5.Now we are on day 6 to 10.Learning pronunciation rules.For the next 5 days,focus on learning Englishpronunciation rules.So it's not like it is a random language.It has rules just like Hindi, Gujarati,Bengali, Tamil, Marathi.So if you understandand learn those rules,you will, of course,become better at speaking the right way,pronouncing it the right way.So you will go back and we'll say,elaborate on day 6 to 10with specific exercises and tests.And now let's go.Here it is, right.So now we have the program for oursecond set of 5 days.What will we do on day 6?Start by learningthe international phonetic alphabet,called the IPA,which is a system of symbols used torepresent the sounds of English.This will help you understandthe pronunciation rules more easily.Now we need to learn something about IPA.So we say, tell us where to learnabout the IPA.Here it is, you've got all the links.You can go to these links,or you can go to IPA.So you will see,International Phonetic Association.But in all of this, one thing is missing,which is often a very important criterionfor learning anything.Why did we never like our school?We did not like our schoolbecause we were not learning anything,because learning was not fun,learning was boring, it seemed a drag.We felt likewhy do we have to go to school again?How can we make it fun?How can we make it better?So we will ask the same thing.How can we make these 30 daysmore fun and engaging?Let's ask.And then it will give you some answers.Use gamification.What is gamification?Gamification is where try to learnsomething by playing games.Intuitively,everybody likes playing games,whether they are simple gamesor complicated games.Not necessarily video games,it could be any type of a game.Ludo is also a game,Snakes and Ladders is also a game.If you watch IPL, even that is a game.If you play video games,even that is a game.Why are we addicted to that?Because they appeal to our senses,to our psychology.And what this says is,turn language learning into a gameby setting up challenges,earning points or badges,and competing with friends.So you can use language learning appssuch as Duolingo or Memrise.If you haven't used Duolingo,this is not an endorsement,but Duolingo is a great appthrough which you can learnmany languages, not just English.And the best thing about Duolingois that it gamifies it.It keeps giving you tests,it gives your rewardsafter clearing that test,that's how you earn badges,you can show off those badges,you can compete with your friendsor strangers,and it just makes learning a lot of fun.Include cultural activities.Learning about the cultureand customs of English-speaking countriescan make the English languagemore engaging.Watch movies, TV shows in English.Read books by English authors.And this is somethingthat has been proven.In fact, there's a friend of Uzma,I kid you not, she is 5 years old,she speaks in a British accent.Do you know why?Because she only watches Peppa Pig on TV.Peppa Pig is a very famous cartoon,which is a British cartoon abouta lady pig, a child pigand she has a brother called George.So it is a story of Peppa and George.Both of them are pigs,the whole world is ofpigs and other animals,and of course,because it is a British comedy,they speak in a British accent.That is her exposure to English.She doesn't go to a school,she goes to a preschool,but they don't talk much in Englishin the preschool.So her introduction to Englishis just British English,and not surprisingly,she speaks in a British accent,because that is how she has absorbedand learned the languagein the first place.If you also indulgein these cultural activities,you will also begin to absorb them.Use social media.Follow English-speaking influencersand celebrities so that you are ableto learn a lot from their conversation.Take online classes, of course,which is always there.Use creativity to practice English.Write short stories or poems in English.Create videos or podcasts in English.Draw or paint pictures relatedto English, etc.And that then makes it fun as well.A simple way of thinking about it is,if you want to learn the English languageto speak it, you know how to read it,you even understand it,but you hesitate to speak it,then start hearing everythingin English which interests you.If you like cricket,then listen to cricket commentaryin English.If you like movies,then watch English movieswith English subtitles.If you like TV series,then watch English TV serieswith English subtitles.If you like Reels or Shorts,then follow only those peoplewho create this content in English.So that you end up consumingmore and more of the languagethat you want to get better at.A simple way but a smart way ofmaking it live.As you can see, all of this is beingdriven by this software called Chat GPT.It is giving you a step-by-step curriculumlike a tutor.If I say, make this into a 90-day exerciseso that I can master speakingin English within the 90 days.And it has the exercise.It has made the 90-day plan.And again, follow the exact same thing.So expand on day 1 to 30.And it will expand.It will give you everythingthat you need to do.Day 1 to 5, day 6 to 10.You can also double-click that.Expand on day 1 to 5.It will tell you everythingthat you need to do day-wise.It will also tell you the specific hoursto do things in.It will also create a routine.So you say, create a routine for allthe days, if I am busybetween 10-6 p.m. every day.Let's see what it says.Wow!It gives you a routine.Morning, then 10 to 11, then 1 to 2,then 6 to 7, then 8 to 9,and it just gives you the routine as well.It's incredible!Like literally, you get...This is not all true, ok.It's not necessary thatthis is the only way and the right way,but it is directional.It is giving you a sense ofhow you can use software, technology,and your curiosity to learn anything.English is just an example.I hope this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
