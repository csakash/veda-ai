Whatever age you are,there is a very good model to investcalled the UPP model.I will try to explain this model today,because of this you will be ableto understand, learn,and execute everything around investmentfrom tomorrow itself.The full form of UPP isUnplanned life Present life Planned life.Our investments are around these 3 only.Our investments should be forour unplanned life,for our present life,and for our planned life.Let's try and understandwhat are these three things.First of all, unplanned life.Everything in life doesn't go as planned.In fact, a lot of thingsnever go according to plan,it's always a surprise.But a few things can shake up our life.And your investmentsshould be planned for them.This means you are investmentshave to plan for the unplanned life.All the circumstances thatyou can't predict,you won't even hope for themto happen to you,but God forbid if they do,then you should be ready for them.This unplanned life is dividedinto 3 parts.Emergency, health, and life.Emergency means God forbid,you lose your job, it's 2023,a recession time,and a lot of layoffs are happening,and I hope you are not one of them,but unfortunately, if you are,then it suddenly puts a pressureon your income.Or you meet an accidentbecause of which you can't workfor 3-6-9 months.Any such emergencywhere you have to immediatelymeet your expensesbut the income has stopped.And for this, there is an emergency fund.An emergency fund should befor 6 months at leastand 12 months ideally.An emergency fund should be able tomeet the monthly expenses of your needs,not of your wants,not even your investments,forget about all of them,because an unplanned period is going on,so we have to focusonly on our needs right now,like your rent, EMI,water and electricity bill,food expenses,expenses of the things you need,all of those are your needs.So multiply your monthly expensearound your needs by 6 or 12.Your emergency fund should be readyto bear 6 months' expenses at leastand 12 months' expenses ideally.This is the first step towards investingfor unplanned life.Where should this emergency fund be kept?70% of it should be in a fixed deposit.That fixed deposit should be such thatif you break it,you don't have to give any penalty.20% of it should bein your savings account,and 10% of it should always be with youin cashbecause you may need itat any point in time.This is the first thing.Number 2:Unplanned life around health.God forbid if you or your family havean illness, because of whichyou have to be hospitalized,then the hospital expensescan erode all your savings.In the last 2-3 years, we have seenso many families being devastatedbecause of Covid expenses.People got saved but lost all their money,and sometimes even people were lost.It is damaging when you think about that.So, health insuranceis extremely important,not just for you, but for your familyand your parents too.If you are married,then you, your spouse,and your children should havesingle health insurance.Don't add your parents to it please,because the premium for your parentswill be really highas they pass 60 years of ageand become senior citizens.And if you are added to their insurance,then without any reason,you will be in theirhigh-age premium bracket.So a separate insurance foryour parents,a separate insurance for your in-laws,and a separate insurancefor your own family.If you already have corporate insurance,then please take your own insurancein addition to it,because the day you leave the job,your health insurance will lapse,or it is very complicated to transfer it,and all the benefits of no claim bonusthat you have accrued till now,or the pre-existing diseasesthat would be applicable now,but when you take new insurancetheir waiting periodwould start all over again,and you lose out on all of them,and it will not be good for you.So please, along with corporate insurance,take separate health insurancefor your family, your parents,and your in-laws.And the third element for investingfor an unplanned life is life insurance.If your family survives on your income,then you are extremely critical.God forbid if something happens to youthen you don't want your familyto be in financial distress.So you should take an insurance coverof at least 20 timesof your annual incomeor ideally 25 timesof your annual income.If your annual income is â¹5 lakhs,then take a life insuranceof 20 times of it which is â¹1 crore,or ideally 25 times of itwhich is â¹1.25 crore.This means if something happens to youthen whoever you nominate in your familywill get this â¹1 croreor â¹1.25 crore after you.While taking life insurance,please do not buy investment plans,because we will talk about it separatelyin our planned life.This is unplanned, do not confuse it.In life insurance for unplanned life,only go for term plans,because you get maximum coverage in itfor the lowest premium possible.And take it as soon as possiblebecause when you are young,your premium would be lesser,and that will ensure that you paythe same premium for a long time,and you will actually gaina lot by saving that money.This is for the unplanned lifewhich is in 3 parts,emergency, health, and life.Then comes Present life.How can you think about investmentsin the present life?For the present life, many people say,'Ankur Warikoo comesand asks us to invest.Why should we save money for old ageand not use it now?'It is a very valid point.And I have never said thatyou put your present life under mortgageto build a great future life.This is absolute stupidity!So what you have to follow isa budgeting process.A process where you budgetyour monthly income in such a waythat you are able to meet your expenses,meet your desires,and invest for your planned life as well.And the best budgeting processis called the 50:30:20 rule.The 50:30:20 rule says thatyour monthly income after taxes,a maximum of 50% of itshould go toward your needs,it could be your rent, your EMI,your water and electricity bill,your food expenses, basic clothing,your subscriptions,all of those that you requireto live life.It doesn't include your wants, ok?They will be included in the next section.So this 50% is towards your needs.30% of your monthly take home should betowards your desires.If you want to buy a phone, go ahead.If you want to go on a vacation, go ahead.If you want to party every day, go ahead.But within this 30%.This is the discipline.If you adopt this,then you will actually becomevery smart about your money.So let me give you an example.Suppose your monthly incomeis â¹50,000 in hand.How much is its 30%?â¹15,000.You want to buy a phone,and the phone is for â¹45,000.So you have two options.Either you will say,'Let's buy it for â¹45,000 througha credit card,then I will keep paying it every month.The credit card companywill also make money,and I will also get a phone.'Stupidity!The second option is,'I have a budget of â¹15,000 every monthfrom which I want to give keepâ¹5,000 separately,because I want to partyor buy new clothes,so I can save â¹10,000.So I will buy this phoneafter 4.5 months only.'And that will be the disciplinewith which you will operate.Then there is the third way.What is it?We will wait for an offer,a no-cost EMI offer.If we get a no-cost EMI offer,and buy this phone for â¹45,000through a 3-6 monthwithout any interest split payment,then we will go for that.So every month, from our budgetof â¹15,000,we will give â¹7,500 or â¹10,000towards paying the EMI of that phone.Now that is a smart way ofthinking about it.You will not spend â¹45,000 in one gobecause your budget is â¹15,000 only,so you will have to meet your desireswithin that â¹15,000.And then the remaining 20% at least,you will invest towards your planned life.But before that, a small twist.Every year, you will get an increment,or a promotion, your incomewill keep increasing by God's grace,and you will have side incomes,basically more money.Now if you split this money againin 50:30:20,then basically what you are doing iscommitting the crime oflifestyle inflation.This means as your income increasesyour lifestyle also rises.What is the sense in this?Because my friend,your wants are limitless.You can buy as much as you wantand never be satisfied.The way to think about thisis whenever you get an incrementor a promotion or a lump sum amount,then you do a reverse ratio with it,and invest 50% towards your planned life,30% towards your wants and desires,and only 20% towards your needs.So you keep your needs to a minimum,stay in a small range,and keep your wants at 30%,but keep increasing your savings,your investment of planned life,and if you do thisover a long period of time,you will realize that your planned lifeis going to be absolutely beautiful.And that brings us to the third part,which is the planned life.What is a planned life?Planned life is everything thatyou want from yourself in your life.Your own house, own car,children's education,your wonderful marriage,a very good retirement life,all these things are planned.But for this, a huge one-time investmentis required.Where does that investment come from?If you want a houseand you are also taking a loan,then 20-25% will be neededfor the down payment.Nowadays loans of one croreare available just like this,so where will those â¹20-25 lakhscome from?That will come throughyour planned life investments.And there is a very simple ruleto treat planned life investments,called the 100-x rule.If you are age is x,suppose you are 25 years old,so 100-x is the rule that you haveto follow to make sure thatyou are investing properly.How does that rule work?X which is your age in percentage,you have to invest thatin safe instruments.What are safe instruments?It's not FD, my friend.FD is not an investment instrument,FD is only to protect your money.So you can put your emergency fundin an FD,but money doesn't grow in FD,they are destroyed.You will not make this mistake, okay?So, here is what you do.Provident fund,if you are a salaried employee.If you are a salaried professional,then EPF or Employee Provident Fund.If you are not salary,or if you can put extra,then there is PPF.There is the National Saving Scheme,National Saving Certificate, gold,all of these are basically instrumentsthat are considered safe.Why safe?Because they have a fixedor a very small range of movementof rate of return.It is far lower thanwhat you can get in the stock market,but we won't play a lot with that X%.So if you are 25 years old,then 25% of your planned life investment,which is 20% of your total in-hand incomewill be invested towardthese safe instruments,and do it with absolute dedicationevery month on the same day as a SIP.You can ask your employer to deduct itor do it yourself, it doesn't matter,but you will keep doing it,and over a period of time,this will yield yousafe predictable returns.But since you are only 25 years old,you can take risks,and that is where 100-x.The remaining 100-25which is 75% will be investedin the stock market.But we will not gamblein the stock market,we will not go for options and futures,we will not do trading,we will do proper disciplinedlong-term investing.And for that, we will not even researchwhich stock to pick.Ankur Warikoo has said thatWarikoo debt will grow fromâ¹1 to â¹2 overnight,invest in it.No! Nothing of that sort!No stock tips, no Telegram groups,nothing whatsoever.If anybody becomes rich overnight,they also get poor overnight.The right way to become rich isover a long period consistently.So what do you do?You invest in a portfolio of stocks.We do not have the expertise, the time,or the experience to pick stocks.If you do, then please go ahead.I don't have it,I am assuming you also don't have it,so you will invest ina portfolio of stockswhere somebody else is managingthose stocks for us.They do this all the timeand this is what they get paid for.So they should do their work,and we will do ours.What will you do?Mutual Funds are a good starting point.You will buy 3 mutual funds.Number one:Nifty 50 index Mutual Fund.This mutual fund investsin the top 50 companies in India.And they have managerswho see the ratio of these 50 companies,how many stocks to buy,how many stocks sell,and when to buy and sell.It's their job and their headache.You will not get into it.You will only give them your money.So from the 75%,which we got from 100-x,then 60% of it,means if you are investing â¹100in the stock market,then you will invest â¹60in the Nifty 50 index mutual fund.Why the majority of it?Because it is a safer optionin the stock market.It has the top 50 companies,so they won't fluctuate a lot,they are stable,they have good consistent growth,they are old companies,so that is a good safe bet, relatively.You will invest 25%in the Midcap index mutual fund.What is midcap?Those companies havea market capitalization or sizeof 7-20,000 crores,and they are at the next levelfrom large companies.So you will investin the top 100 companiesin that range of middle capitalization.What will happen with this isyou will get some more growth.However, why are we investing 25 onlyif we are getting more growth?Because it's risky as well.If there is a recession,then the top 50 companiescan still be stable,but the middle ones can lose their groundbecause they are small companies.That's why you don't want to takeas much risk, so 25% only.Then you will invest the last15% in Smallcap index mutual fund.The companies which areless than 7,000 crores,but from them,also we will investin the top 100 companies.There will be a managerwhose only task is to manage this,and they will do it.Why 15% only?Because they will give youa very high returnover a long period of time,but again very risky.If there is a recessionor there is a currency exchange problemor something else,then they can go up and down very fast.We don't want that anxiety.So you want something which is stable.So this mix of 60-25-15 will give youa 15-18% yearly return on average.This means, your money will doubleevery 3.5-4 years.And imagine what that does overa 20-year period.In those 20 years,your money will grow by 16 to 32 times,by just putting in this moneywith absolute dedication every month,and that will take careof your planned life.If you are 25 years old,then you can get married by using this,you can build a house using this,when you will have kids,their education expensescan be done using this,your retirement will certainlybe done through this,everything will be taken care of,and that is a beautyof this disciplined approach.So these three things,emergency, health, and lifefor unplanned life,budget for the present life,50:30:20, and investment for planned life,100-x where you will invest X%in safe instruments and 100-xin the stock marketin the ratio of 60:25:15.By following this simple approach,I guarantee you financial independencebecause, in the next 10-20-30 years,India will experience its best period,in terms of economic growth,in terms of stock market growth,in terms of opportunities,in terms of income growth,and you will have to make a mistaketo not enjoy this wave.So don't make that mistake!The biggest mistake that people makeis that they keep waiting,because they think they don't havethe clarity about what should they do,where to start and how.I have provided you with thator tried to at least in this video.So please with this clarity,start your investing journey in 2023,and make this year your yearwhen you start taking chargeof your money, of your life.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
