Check 1 2 Ok, let's get started.How much does your carworth â¹7 lakhs actually cost you?We will get to know in this video.Friends, I got inspired tomake this video by Mandeepfrom Labor Law advisor.He made an amazing short onwhat is the actual cost ofownership of a car.Based on that, I saw thatwhatever he said in those 60 seconds,I can elaborate it to 10-15 minutesand share it with youthrough an excel sheet.In this video, we will get to knowthat whenever we buy a carwhich we think is a great asset,then how much does itactually cost us?And I made this mistakein my life early on,and I would not like any of youto make the same mistake.Till now I have bought 3 cars,and the first car of my lifewas Maruti Swift, which I boughtwhen I was 26 years old.So I finished my MBAat the age of 26, I got a new job,I was earning in lakhs,so I thought of spending in lakhs,hence I bought a VXI modelof Swift in red color.It had a great pick-up.I had that car for 6 years.After that in 2011 or 2012,I bought my second carwhich was Renault Scala.I want a big car becausemy family was expanding.If I had to go somewherewith my parents,then that car seemed small.I had kids too,so we thought of buying a big car,hence we bought a sedan.So we upgraded the carwhich was for around â¹5 lakhsto a car worth â¹9 lakhs.The car which are boughtin 2011-12, was with me till 2020.Then in 2020, when I got some wisdom,that buying a car is franklyequal to wasting money...Then in 2020, I got some wisdom,that buying a car is franklyequal to wasting money,so I forgot about all that,and thought of taking a car for rent.So I have a rented car.I have an office car toowhich I have given to my parents.We give â¹25,000 per monthfor a rented car,which includes everything,and that's how we work.But the key is, when you arein your 20s, then buyinga car is like an ambition,like an objective,it denotes social status,and through this video,I want to explain to you that,in a way it is right,but it is important to knowthe implications of theeconomic decision of buying a car.So if I were to ask you,and pause this videoand answer this questionin the comments section,if you buy a car worth â¹7 lakhs,suppose you buy a Swiftwhich is around â¹7 lakhs, ex-showroom,then how much money would youactually spend to own that carfor the next 5 years?To buy that car worth â¹7 lakhs,how much money would you have toearn to own that car for 5 years?Pause the video, give mean answer in the comments section,and we will see how close or faryour answer is.Ok, done.Now let's see the video,and try to get to knowthrough an excel sheet,that this car worth â¹7 lakhs,or we can take any other valueand get to know, how much doesthis car actually cost us?First of all, tax.How much tax do we have to givewhen you buy a car worth â¹7 lakhs?I would assume that you arealready in the 30% tax bracket.So we will assume thatyour tax is 30%.We will also assumethat the inflation would bearound 5% for the next five years.It has increased now,but hopefully, it would be 5%.We are buying a car,I have chosen the Swift VXI modelon cardekho,this is not an advertisement.So the ex-showroom price is â¹6,74,000.When we watch an ad and seethat the starting priceis â¹5.99 lakhs, so we feel,'Wow! We can get a carfor â¹6 lakhs, let's go!'Let's see what happens now.So the ex-showroom price is â¹6,75,000.On top of that, we have to pay RTO,which is the registration,the on-road tax,which is around â¹47,000.You will have to pay forthe insurance which will bearound â¹36,000.So broadly, the on-road pricewould be around â¹7,60,000.But to pay this â¹7,60,000,you will have to earn much more,then pay taxes on it,and then you earn these â¹7,60,000.So if your tax is 30%,then your CTC, which you willearn from the company,they will then transfer it to you,then the government will take some tax,and after that, the money youget would be â¹10,80,000.So this is the first shocker!And it is important for youto recognize because,at the end of it, when you work,you work for these â¹10,80,000,you are not working for â¹7,00,000.It is a different matter,that we try very hard to save tax,how much we can save in that,whatnot, but at the end of it,it is a material outcometo your decision making.After that, we supposethat you will have this car for 5 years.So, year 1, year 2, year 3,year 4, year 5.And there will be expensesin these 5 years,so let's try to add those expenses.First of all, let's assumethat you drive for 18,000 km every year,which would be around 1,500 km in a month,which is on average what is reasonable.If you drive too much or too little then,of course, you can change it.But broadly, you will drive 90,000 kmin 5 years, which is usuallywhat you will find in a city car.Insurance gradually decreases,because of the value of the car,it is called IDV,so you pay insurance on thedepreciated value of insurance.So as the value of the car decreases,the insurance amount also decreases.Broadly, the depreciation inMaruti cars is around 6-10% annually.We will take it as 6%,let's take the lesser one.This means, every yearthe value of Maruti's carwill decrease by 6%.You can see this amount inany used car valuation,so you will get a broad idea.This means, you have alreadygiven insurance of â¹36,000in the first year,so the next insurancewill reduce like this.So, at the end of the year,you will have to payâ¹34,000, â¹32,000, â¹30,000,and â¹28,000.So you would have to paya total of â¹1,60,000in insurance only.The second is maintenance.You will have to bearmaintenance every year.You have to get servicing done,some other repair work.Since after 3 years,it would complete 50,000 km,you would your car's tyres,so that would cost around â¹20,000.You can take this also as less,but I have just assumed all these.So, you spend â¹1,18,000on servicing or maintenancein the next 5 years.Then comes the big expense, petrol.So, what is the average?If you Swift's site,they have written 23.76,this is what the company declares,but this never happens at all,but just to make you happy,I will consider this only.So we will start with23.76 km per liter.It will keep decreasing every yearbecause mileage reduces.How?I have assumed that it will reduceaccording to the depreciation.So I have reduced this also by 6%.So, if you get around 24 km per literin the first year,then by the end of 5 years,it would be 19 km per liter,it is very high butwe are just assuming.So how much petrol would youneed every year?If you drive for 18000 km every year,then you would need 750-950 literevery year.What is the expense of petrol?Right now it is â¹100,we have assumed inflation as 5%,so with that assumption,after 5 years, petrol would be for â¹122.This is my first predictionin March 2022, that by the next 5 years,in March 2027, petrol would be for â¹122.We will see whether the prediction wouldbe wrong or right, but let'sassume this for the calculation.So what is the expenseof petrol every year?In the first year, it is â¹75,000.Then â¹84,000, â¹93,000, â¹1,04,000,â¹1,16,000, so in 5 yearswe spend â¹4,75,000 on petrol.So, our total running costcomes out to be,the cost of driving the car,ownership is separate, it was this,the cost of driving the carincludes insurance, then maintenance,and after that, the expense of petrol,so we spend around â¹7,50,000in 5 years to drive this car.So, to pay these â¹7,50,000,we will have to earn money,and pay tax on it.So to earn these â¹7,50,000,we will actually haveto earn â¹10,80,000.After giving 30% tax on it,we will have â¹7,50,000,which we will spend to drive this car.That is how much we willspend on running this car.So, your total cost of ownershipof this car, Swift, if I ask you all,which I did, that if you haveto own and run this Swift car,how much would it cost youand how much would you have to earn,then the right answer is â¹21,60,000.This is the cost of owning one car.This is shocking!It is shocking, right,when you see it from thisperspective, you realize,'Oh my God! What am I doing?Whether what I am doing isright or wrong?We will extrapolate it furtherbecause this decision thenbecomes a very very important decision.So now, let's see that after 5 years,if you want to sell this car,and that's fine, you want to sell it,so let's check for that.I checked on carwale,used car valuation,since cardekho was askingfor the number, and I didn'twant to give that.I have taken the 2017 modelof Maruti Suzuki VXI,because we are selling the carin March 2022, and this Delhi's pricefor a petrol car.So they are saying, if it isin fair condition, then â¹4,80,000.If it is in great condition,then â¹5,14,000.I think it's too high, but I thought,let's take this only,so let's take it as â¹5 lakhs broadly.This means, if you would wantto sell this car after 5 years,then you will get â¹5 lakhs.Broadly, neither a penny less nor more.So the value of these â¹5 lakhsin today's date is â¹4,11,000because inflation is 5%, as we considereverything as per today's date.This means if want to buya car worth â¹7 lakhs today,then in the next 5 years,you should be ready to spendâ¹16.5 lakhs.You will have to earnâ¹16.5 lakhs to buy a carworth â¹7 lakhs on today's date.This is what you need to bear in mind.So, both these numbers,â¹21,60,000 or â¹16,60,000 is somethingthat you have to registerin your mind, because this isan important decision.If I tell you this today,and we are in March 2022,the stock market is in trouble,it has dipped a lot becausethere is a lot of chaos in the world,so I am getting DMs,messages every day that,'Ankur sir, you advised meto invest in the stock market,my return is down by 5% or 10%,my heart is pounding,my hands are sweating,I am having sleepless nights,what do I do and what not?'And I was like,'Boss, have patience!Be patient because this isthe definition of the market.You may be investing for thefirst time and that's why thisis your first experience,but I've been seeing thisfor the past 10-20 years,the world has seen it,if you look at any data,then at an average of 5-10 years,the stock market always givesa positive return.All you need to do is be patient.'But if I ask you,'Dude, give me â¹10,80,000in the first year,which is this amount.You give me â¹10,80,000 in a year,and after 5 years,I will give you â¹5 lakhs.Wow! What a scheme! Wow!Amazing! Ankur Warikoo chit fund!Brilliant!Because of this, my money willgo down by 18% every year!That is what happenswhen you own a car.I'm not saying that buyinga car is stupidity.I'm saying that whenever youtry to buy something in lifewhose value will 100% decrease,then you have to question,At what point will you stop?Because if you are earning money,and I have done this calculationassuming it's all your money,God forbid if you would takea bank loan, and you say,'Wow! I get a call from HDFCevery day asking,Sir, are you ready to takea car loan only at 7-8%for your favorite dream car?And you would say, wow!HDFC is calling me,I will have to go! Why not?I am getting my dream carat just 8%! I am earning this much.'So then, the interest wouldalso be added to it.And when you earn more moneyto pay off this interest,then it would go even higherbecause of the 30%,so that calculation will beat a different level.But irrespective of that,the key point that I'm tryingto make is to think of a caras a car only.Think of any depreciatingasset as just that only.How much importance do you wantto give it in life?Does it represent your existence?Do you think that owning a big,expensive, and luxuriouswill raise your status in societyand that will make you feel good?But how much are you ready topay for it, negative 18% every year?Are you ready to burn your moneyby 18% every year for your status,for your position in society?If yes, then hats off to you!Then you have a lot of money!I am not ready!And I would suggest and recommendthat nobody in the world should be.Whenever I see people buyingMercedes worth â¹50 lakhs, â¹60 lakhs,â¹80 lakhs, â¹1 crore, it baffles me!I can't imagine what these peoplewould do by sitting in that car,it is just taking them frompoint A to point B.I am as happy in my rented car,or Ola, or Uber, maybe not as much,but I'm not that sad thatI would be ready to reducemy money by 18% every year.It's better that I stand onthe 13th-floor balcony toblow money from there!Use this to calculatewhat you should do?And I'm so glad thatI've always bought carsthat were below my status,because for me, buying a caris simply a status symbol,and I'm not going to pay for that,because a far more important purposefor me for a car is justsimple transportation.So, if its job is to take mefrom point A to Point B,then that's its only job.I am not going to give far moreimportance to it than what it deserves.I hope through this video,you will stop buying cars,and start buying stocks of cars.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
