Number 1:Eye contact.Eye contact is scientifically provento form a connection,and it is also shown thatthe more you maintain eye contact,the more people consider you smart.But it can be very awkwardto maintain eye contact.So a good hack for that is tryingto determine the color of the eye.So look into their eyes,and then start talking,like the way I am doing it right now.If you look at their noseor their forehead or their ear,then it will be evident,but if you talk while looking intotheir eyes and maintain eye contactfor a long period,people will begin to think thatyou are actually smart.Number 2:Are you nervous before an interviewor an event or some conversationor presentation?It is proven that chewing gumcalms nervousness.Of course, you can't have itwhile having that conversation,but before that, if you chew chewing gum,and just chew it without making noise,but generally, what it does isit just soothes and calms you down.The way that it works is mentholwhich is usually in peppermint,which makes it cool for you.So it kind of titillates the cool senses,but more importantly,your brain focuses on chewing,so it will stop thinking aboutall the things that were distracting youor making you nervousand you begin to feel a sense of calm.Number 3:If somebody is angry with you goand sit with them.The more you keep your distance from them,the more their anger will be activated,because it is easy to shoutor show anger at a person from a distance,but imagine if you are sitting with them,then it becomes really hard for themto be angry at you.That's why they say thatif a person is very angry with you,then go and hug them.It will instantly diffuse the situation.If you can't hug them becausethere are times when you can't,just sit next to them.It's very dangerous and scary,it seems that what if they hitor shout so loudly,we will be even more scared,but it is proven that as soon as you goand sit with an angry person,their anger subsides.Number 4:During a conversation,if you are thinking aboutwhether the other personis interested in you or not,not necessarily romanticly,in any way,then observe their feet.If their feet are pointing towards you,then it means that they are fullyinto the conversation.But if you are facing this wayand their feet are in that direction,that means they want to get out ofthat conversation.This instant hack can tell youwhether to continue the conversation,or if that person has already checked out,so you might as well not waste your timeand let them go.And that becomes a smart, sensible,and fast way of determininginterest levels.Number 5:It is scientifically proven thatasking questions makes you more likable.Really!The more questions you ask,the more people will like youin one way or another,and here's the reason why.Very few people listen to questions,most people listen to answers,and when they answer,you come across as over-smart,you come across as overconfident,you come across as maybe knowledgeablebut often like,This person always keeps answering.When will they ask a question?But when you genuinely ask questions,not like,What's your name?What's your age?When were you born?These fundamental thingsdon't make you smart,but when you ask genuine questionsto understand, learn, and analyze,you come across as likable,and over time,people begin to think of youas smart as well.This is absolutely oppositeto school and college,because in school and college,we never got the trainingto ask questions,we were only trained to answer,and that too just one correct answer.And that makes it really hard,particularly for people inthe Indian education system trainingto ask questions.That's why this hack is very beneficialif you particularly use itin Indian culture or the work environment.Number 6:If I am telling you somethingwhich you already know,then what would be your natural reaction?It would be,I know!When you do that, people don't like you!Here is a simpler way of doing it.If you already know it, at least listen,listen while maintaining eye contact,and at the end just smile back.That acknowledges it.They know that you have heard them.They don't get to know whetheryou already knew it or not.What you end up doing is making themfeel heard,and at the same time don't hurt them.So please, if you already know,don't tell people,I know! Don't waste my time! I know!Instead, listen and smile back.Number 7:It's very interesting!If you think somebody is watching you,but you don't want to directlylook at them to seeif they are looking at you,then a hack is, you should yawn.You can look at them while yawning.It actually works, it always works.Why?Because when you yawn, people find youthe most harmless.A person who is yawningcan be no danger to anyone,cannot abuse anyone,cannot scream at anyone.They are yawning!What can they do?So that disarms them.They are not so attentive that I hopethey are not looking at me,I hope they don't figure out thatI'm checking them out, so on and so forth.And that then helps you figure outwhat you actually want to do.Interesting, right?Number 8:If you want people to listen to youthen ask for their contribution.It's a very interesting hack,particularly for office.Let's say you want to present an idea,but you think that there are a coupleof people who are against that idea,so it is very important to convince them.Here's how you do it.You ask for their contribution.You say,I have an idea,why don't you share your idea?Then they'll share some ideas,which will also be done.And then incorporate what they have,and then make it into your ideaand present it.When somebody sees their contributionin a larger idea, then they are not ableto reject that idea.That is the psychological hackthat you are deploying.Try it, and let me know how it works.Number 9:They say that the first impressionis the last impression.It's wrong!Research has established thatthe last impression is as importantas the first impression.To prove this, scientists dida very interesting experiment,which was not around peoplebut around an experience.You are made to hear two songsof 60 seconds each.One of them is a normal one.It's playing, whether it's good or bad.And scientists ask you to rate that songon a scale of 5.So some would rate it at 3, or 4,fair enough.There is one control group,which has a similar mix,similar background,and so on and so forth,and they are made to hearthe exact same song,but in the last 5 seconds,there is a shrieking sound,it's irritating, a really deafeningand irritating sound.Then they are asked to rate.And surprisingly, they ratedthe exact same song much lower.Last impression counts.The same thing happensin real life as well.If you are meeting someone,or talking to someone,then the way you end the conversationwill be just as impactful.When you go for an interview,then your handshake, or your address,good morning, good evening,whatever the case is,it's very important in the beginning.But when you leave,how confidently do you leave?Do you say goodbye?Do you say thank you?How confidently do you say it?All these things matter in creatingthat impression thatmakes an overall package.So don't discount the last impression.Number 10:The Benjamin Franklin effect.It's a very interestingand counterintuitive psychological hack.If you want somebody to like you,then ask them for a favor.What?!It seems counterintuitive right?Because intuitively we think thatif we want someone to like us,then we should do something for them.No!This effect says,and this has been proven time and again,that if you ask someone for a favorand they do that favor for you,they tend to like you more after that.And the reason is that they know thattheir commitment or time or experienceor something has gone to you.So now it is about,I have to like this person becauseI contributed to them.And that is how it works.So the next time if you want thatyour boss to like you,or a colleague to like you,then ask them for a favor.It's almost like asking them for help.So you can go to your boss and say,Boss, I would really value your helpif you give me feedback on this slideof this presentation.When they will give you,they'll tend to like you more.They will also like the work thatthey have contributed towards,which was one of the hackswhich we spoke about earlier,and that creates a wonderful loopwhere you use this psychological hackto your benefit and move ahead.Number 11:You wake up in the morning,and a song on the loop in your mind,and you want to get over with the song.The way to do that is to listento the entire song,and that's when it will stop.This effect happens when our brainregisters only incomplete things.Whenever we have some incomplete tasks,they mostly tend to stay in our minds.And we forget the tasks we have completed.In the same way, if there is a song stuckin your head,then listen to the complete song,and you will then let go of the song,because your brainwould have completed the task.Number 12:If you want somebody to knowthat you are listening to them intently,then the right way to do that isto keep nodding.When you nod,it gives the subliminal effectthat you are listening to them keenly.And that may be true, may not be true,it's not necessary,but it definitely gets them to sharea lot more.The best example here is Ranveer.The meme had started,and this is his beauty.When you are doing a podcast,and you have a guest in front of youwho can share a lot,and you want that too,then you have to bringthis psychological hack.I am not saying that Ranveer is faking,he is genuinely a curious person,so he's listening,but the effect that it bringswhen he nods so nicely is thatthe other person shares more openly,and that makes it sucha wonderful conversation.And finally number 13:Regardless of how bad your day went,regardless of how difficult it was,regardless of all your struggles,the simplest way to convert a bad dayinto a good day is a gratitude entry.It is scientifically proven thatat the end of your day,if you write a journal of all the thingsyou are grateful for,like my parents are healthy,my siblings are doing well,my friends love me,my hands and feet can move,I have a house to live in,food to eat, and clothes to wear,whatever the case may be,or whatever you are grateful for,like I met a good person today,I got so many likes on my photo,I did this or that, whatever is it,it doesn't matter.It instantly makes you feel likeyou are in control.You feel that everything in your lifeis not bad.There are so many things forwhich you are thankful,and for which you are giving thanks.And that gets your mindto start thinking positively.These 13 psychological hackswhich anybody can adopt to move ahead,to make people think that you are smart,to make people believe that you mean well,and I would love for you to sharesome other hacks which you have usedand according to you, it's really good.Please share with
