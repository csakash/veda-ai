I started earning for the first timeat the age of 24 years.And when I started earning,I realized that my school, college,parents, siblings, and friendstold me how to work,but didn't tell me the meaning ofworking in an office.What is the importance of buildinga career professionally?And you will all recognize thatit doesn't depend only on the taskyou are doing.There are a lot of other thingswhich you gradually understand,and unfortunately,you don't get previous training for them.23 things I wish somebody had told mewhen I started working,for all of you through my experience.Please take it for what it's worth.Number 1:No matter what you do,whether you are an engineer,a graphic designer, a data analyst,or an IT analyst,ultimately every job is aboutone thing only,and that is people.Every single role ends upabout being people.If you know how to work with people,and people can work with you,then only you will progress in life.Frankly, at some point in time,it stops mattering,what you know and what you do.What matters iswhether can you get people to do that workor not.Number 2:Just because somebodyis good at their work,it doesn't mean they can bea good manager.Working yourself and getting peopleto work are two very different skills.Unfortunately, especially in our country,managers are promoted becausethey do their work properly,and the day they become managers,they realize that they don't knowhow to manage people.And we end up suffering because of that.Number 3:A bitter truth but a truth in fact.You will be able to grow professionallyonly when you make your boss'sor your manager's life easy.This doesn't mean that you have toflatter them or agree with themno matter what.It means if you make their work,and their life easy,they will be able to work at a new level,and you can fill the empty spaceleft by them.But the more you makeyour boss's life difficult,whether they repeatedly have to tell youwhat to do, remind you aboutdoing things correctly,do a follow-up with you repeatedly,or teach you to the same thingagain and again,then you are not going to growprofessionally.It is going to be a hard journey.Number 4:If somebody asked you,how many years of experience do you have?And you say,I have 5 years of experience.Wow!Is it 5 years of experienceor just 1-year experiencewhich you have had five times?There is a vast difference!A lot of people think thatif their work becomes easy,it is their advancement, their success.So what will they do?Send an email and the work is done.Make a call and the work is done.Meet a person and the work is done.No!You have to learn something newevery year.You have to do something new every year.Every task,whether it is in the same role,in the same function,in the same industry,in the same company, must change,because that's when you are advancing,that's when you're learning something new.If you are doing the same thingagain and again,not only will you be bored,but the person who is tryingto evaluate you or promote youor train you, will not be able to do that,because they will see a personwho's become so comfortablewith their work that they are scaredof learning something new.Number 5:Get deep into thingsat the beginning of your career itself,and broaden them later on.Become a specialist early on,and become a generalist eventually.What does this mean?Becoming a specialist doesn't meanyou have to specialize in only one thing.It means whatever task you are doing,you do it with absolute detailand very efficiently.Nobody else can know more aboutthat task than you.That is the goal that you havefor yourself.Because if you do that,you will gradually learn several things.Today you are working in this function,tomorrow you will work on that task,then you will work in that department,but whenever you do whatever task,you will do it withso much detail and depth,that nobody else can do itbetter than you.And at the end of it,when you'll become a senior professional,you will have experience inso many different fields,that you will be able to analyzeall the tasks,and get the work done by people.And that will be the successof your profession, of your career.Number 6:It is very easy to think.Idea comes to every person,but to date, no one has gotan award for saying,Hey, this idea came to me too.No!Only one thing matters,action.Action is greater than thought.That is why my life motto,Do Epic Shit, it doesn't saythink epic shit,it says do epic shit.Meaning, you have to do.Gone are the days when you said,Oh, this idea also came to me5 years back.Hey, I thought of this long ago.There is no value for it, never was!Ideas are very important,but until an idea is executed,until it will not become an action,till then it is just an idea.That idea is useless,it is for free,and every human being has it.Number 7:If you can do one thing in your career,only one thing,then you should meet every commitment.If you said that this thing will be doneby Friday, then it will be done.Once I commit,I don't even listen to myself.That is a true professional,because what happens then isthat people trust us.They know that if Ankur has said this,then it is done.If he has committed, it will happen.And if God forbid, it can't be done,he will tell us ahead of timethat it won't happen,and that too will be a commitment,because they will then tell usby when will it be done.Nothing rewards you more thanthis one simple thing.Whenever you make a promise,you will honor it.Number 8:No job is 9 to 5 or 10 to 6.No job has a fixed duration.Every job is determined byhow much time you work on itin a focused manner.That is your office timing.Otherwise, people can be at it 24 hours,and pretend as if they are working,pretend that they are so engrossedin the work that this is their life,but that doesn't mean anything.The more focused you are on your work,the more you will be able toaccomplish every day.And surprisingly, I realized thatto complete all the tasks,not more than 3 to 4 focused hoursare required.But since we get distracted,sometimes we take smoke breaks,tea breaks, lunch breaks,read a newspaper, listen to music,started chit-chatting,whatever the case may be,then it extends from 3 to 6 hours,6 to 8 hours, you are still in the office,and then you're like,why am I in the office all the time?Because you have fewer focused hoursin your life, in your day.Number 9:This corporate world is a trap,a beautiful trap.You will get a lot of things in this trap.You will definitely get work,you will get a salary,but you will also get perks,you will get privileges,sometimes you will be sent to an off-site,you will get a promotion,you will get an increment,you will get a nice office,you will get free food,you will be told to come anytime,you can do whatever you want,wear whatever you want.You will get used to all these things,you will feel that I am gettingall these things in lifebecause of my hard work,and you will become entitled.The only objective ofthe corporate world is tofind that among all these entitled people,who are the peoplewho do not feel entitled?Who are those people who wake upevery morning thinking,'Man, this job is an opportunity,an opportunity to learn new things,an opportunity to do something new.All these smart people,this great company, this much salary,all these things are an opportunity,where I can make my life my own way.'And that is what corporate is looking for,that is what your company is looking for,because only those peoplemake that company progress.Number 10:Feedback is not given, it is asked.We always wait for feedback,because we hesitate to get that feedback.We wonder what it would be.But to get or to ask for feedbackis your responsibility.Until you don't ask for it,you are putting yourself at lossby shying away from thingsthat you need to work on.Number 11:It is very important to hustlein today's world.If you hustle, you will be ableto grow rapidly for the short term,but if you see this journey as a marathon,then you will win in the long term.Because it doesn't matter whose aheadin the first 100 meters,because this is a marathonof 21 km or 42 km,and you have to keep runningfor hours, for life,so it doesn't matterhow much you earnedin the first 2-3 years,how much you hustled,how much you grew,how many jobs you changed,which car or house you bought.What matters is that for 30-40 years,were you able to pace outyourself properly or not?Did you burn out after 2-3 years?You got so bored with this whole thingthat you lived a worn-out lifefor the remaining 30 years.Not the way to live.Pace yourself out.Don't make your work your life.Do your work efficiently.Don't take any shortcuts.And recognize the fact that afterevery 3-5 years,you will have to take a new avatar,so that you are abreast withwhat the world is throwing at you.Number 12:If every person, every manager,every team leader is into politicsin the company,then it is not politics,it is the culture of the company.And you have to stay away from that.You may have to get rid of that company.A lot of people ask me how to handlea team or a manager who is into politics.And I ask the same question,Is everybody doing it?Because if they are,then it's the company's culture.They want people to flatter each other.They want people to gossipand push their agenda.And if you don't want to play that game,which I think you should not,then please leave.Your work will never be acknowledgedin that company.Number 13:And this was somethingthat was fascinating when I realized it.In all the interview processes,if there is a tiebreak,then do you know who ultimately wins?The person that other people liked.Liking does not meanthat he was more skilled.Liking does not mean thathe scored more or he was froma good college or something.That person was liked.And you know what's an awesome hackto be liked?That he smiled nicelyduring the interview.Not like...No!They smiled nicely, properly,with respect, with discipline,and calmly, they had a smiling face.This is the simplest way to becomelikeable in an interview.I often ask people to do 3 thingsbefore an interview.Be yourself,prepare for all the questions you expect,and smile often.These 3 things, and you will do well,you are bound to do well.Make that happen.Number 14:Toxic jobs exist.A company where you are not respected,things are micro-managed,there's politics, people are not valued,information is held,it's not shared, people are ordered,people are shown their places,every person is thought to be dispensable,these places will ruin you.Your body will get rusted if you workat such places.Please stay away from such places.And before choosing this job,this company, do your research.While choosing a product,a mobile phone,we spend hours on review sites,but when choosing a job or a company,we don't make a call to a personwho worked at that company beforeand doesn't anymore,to understand the culture of the companyand are there growth prospects or not.We take our decision based on moneyand designation.Wrong way of doing that.Toxic jobs exist.Number 15:Probably the most important realizationof my life.If you are not happy doing something,then you can never be the best at it.If you are not happy doing something,then you can never be the best at it.So if you aim to be the best at something,then you will have to find happinessin doing it.You will have to do somethingthat makes you happy.Number 16:Especially for young professionals.Do not be afraid to take a pay cutfor the right experience.Be ready to take a pay cutfor the right experience.Because the right experience willvery quickly give you a returnon that money that you can't even imagine!Initially, try to learn.Attempt difficult things so thatyour skill improves rapidly.Your learning curve is so steep thatyou leave your colleagues in schoolor college or at work behind.And they are like,How come they are so fast!?And that will determine your growth.If it is not making money for you,it will happen ultimately,and it will be far more thanyou could have ever imagined for yourself.Number 17:At the beginning of your career,say this as less as possible,It's not my job.In fact, don't say it at all.Don't just grab any task you get,but if you get a task throughwhich you get to learn something new,and it may not be in the scopeof your workor in the definition of your role,take it.Don't say, 'it's not my job.'But as you become a senior,you have to say,it's not my job.It is their job.Because that's how you are givingthat task to a specialized person,so that you know that they will dothat job better than you can.So initially,learn as many new things as possible.And later on, give that taskto the person who can do it efficiently.Number 18:College doesn't prepare us for work.This was my biggest realization.You think you are learning a lotin college.Crap!College doesn't prepare usfor work at all.College only prepares us for giving tests.College first teaches,and then takes test.Life first takes test,and then teaches something.And that is a big difference!Don't depend on college to prepare youfor your career, for your work life.College is a different kind of training,real life will be absolutely different.Number 19:Be nice to people.Help people.Because the world is very small,and you are just starting.Who knows which circle will you take,and reach back to the same person?The same experience may come back to you.The same chapter may open again.And at that point in time,you don't want to be the one to be like,I wish I had treated this person...The world is very small, it's round,the same person will come back to youat some point in a few years,the same situation will repeat itself,and at that point in time,you don't want to be telling yourself,I wish I had behaved betterwith that person.You don't want to be that person.Be nice to people.Help people.Number 19:Be nice to people.Help people.The world is very small, it's round,the same person will come back to youafter a few years, and at that point,you don't want to be telling yourself,I wish I had treated this person better.You want to treat everybody nicely.No matter how they behave with you,you will behave well.You will not be like them.You will not do what they are doing to youand you are not liking it.You will be well-behaved.You will never shout at them.If nobody has done anything wrong to you,then you will be better behaved with them,respect them, give them the positionthat they deserve which you wantfor yourself,and that will be the way that you willbuild a brand for yourself that peoplewill actually end up liking.Number 20:Do you know what is the most importantthing in your career journey?Your manager, your boss.You will learn the most from them.They will form the definitionof leadership for you.You will be the most scared of them,if at all.You will get the best feedbackfrom them or not.And early on, I believe,no matter whether you havea great boss or not,the important thing is thatthey should know their job.And if they know their job,and they are training you well,whether by scolding youor being nice to you,that is the best manager.A lot of people say, I need a nice person.We want a person who trains usby being nice to us.But such managers never tell us the truth.They always sugarcoat the feedback,and because of that,we are never able to directlyunderstand our improvement areas.Go for a manager who actually gives youdirect straight feedback.That could be nothing better than thatfor your career.Number 21:People around you in college or at workwill generate opportunitiesfor you in life.Keep them in your mindand plan your career and life.Don't dismiss them.Get to know them.Get to understandwhere they are coming from.Make friends with them.Because these are the peoplewho in the future will workin this company, in this country,in this industry, in this brand,and they will then remember youas the person who works well,respect people, speaks warmly,never thinks bad for anyone,and they will then seek you out.Through them,your next set of opportunitieswill emerge.I can guarantee this becauseI have experienced this myself.Number 22:A very important truth.Your passion is not just lyingaround somewhere.So when people say,Find your passion!It is not hiding behind the couchor under the tablethat you will find it one day.Your passion gradually develops.You have to explore your passion.Something that puts a spark in you,and when you focus on it,you realize whether it can becomeyour passion or not.Your passion is not hiding somewhere,you don't have to look for it,you have to develop it.You have to adopt it and build it.That will become your passionover a period of time.And number 23:The thing that sums up everything.Use your 20s to explore things,not to settle down.The whole world will keep askingyou to settle down, quickly settle down.Finish your studies by 25,get married and have a child by 30,something else by 35.At the age of 20, in that decade,keep exploring.Keep finding the things you are good at,things that make you happy.Then in your 30s,do all that you know works for you.In your 30s,focus and do all the thingsyou are actually good at,and things that make you happy.And then in your 40s,you financially retire.Because by your 40s,either you will be in a careerthat makes you really happythat it doesn't seem like a job to you,or you would have doneso well for yourselfand made so much moneythat you don't need to be in a job.Either case, you will be freeby the time you hit your 40s.That is the goal for everyone's career.I hope that these 23 pieces ofcareer advice are beneficialto all of you.I have shared them with youfrom my life experiences,and I hope that you found some of themapplicable to your life as well.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
