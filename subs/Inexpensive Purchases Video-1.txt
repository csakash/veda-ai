Alright, let's get started.Aditya this whole video would be almostscreen-recorded, so let me startthe screen recording.OkIn this video, I want to sharewith you my best purchasesIn this video, I want to share withyou my best purchases which are lessthan â¹1000, and a big giveaway around that.Let's see this video, what rubbish!AgainIn this video, I will share with you allmy favorite purchases which areless than â¹1000, and of course,all those purchases for you as a giveaway.Friends, this is going to be a fun video.So, I keep buying a lot of thingsbut more often than not,it's not necessary that if somethingis expensive, then it has to be good as well,a lot of those things would be cheap as well.And I want to share with you allthose products in this video,which I have bought in the past year.All of them are less than â¹1000,but they are so good, and so beneficialand efficient in my life for me,that I wanted to share that with all of you.Of course, all these products wouldbe available for you as a giveaway.As you keep watching the video,I will keep telling you how can you getthese products absolutely free of cost.The first product is for my iPhoneI bought the Spigen Rugged Armor Case.If the phone falls or breaks, I did not wantsomething which is just a plastic coverto avoid scratches, no, I needed somethingwhich is rugged.Spigen is a brilliant company.I am of course, showing this for iPhonebut it is available for any phone.All of them are mostly under â¹1000.Brilliant product!It makes the phone seem to be a little thick,it seems like it is Batman's phone,but it is great like it has this nice happy stand,you can even take off the cover to make it light,so it almost has two layers which makesit really thick, but I really reallylike it because it's rock solid.The other one is the mobile stand cover.So, this mobile stand cover is like sucha simple nice happy thing, you canchange its angle also. It's just very verysimple and very convenient to use.So, you can keep your phone on thestand while it's charging. If you wantto watch something, you can keep it like this.I really like these simple productsbecause they are so elegantly designed.Of course, they are not even expensive,it just lends in a lot to my tabletop.Next, and this is such a mandatorything in Indian homes.This is an air freshener, room freshener,but the best thing is it works withbatteries and at regular intervalswhich can be set, you can set it toeither 1 minute or 5 minutes,and it sprays a scent ora perfume in the room.So you don't have to goand keep pressing it.It is kept in our washroom,right on the top of the commode,or in our kitchen or dressing room,wherever you would want nice happyfresh feelings and perfume, so it's just therealmost in every room of our house.We love it! It is a refill so you have tocontinuously keep changing it so itbecomes a slightly expensive productto maintain, but for a one-time purchase,I think one refill is good enough fora month, if you keep it at thelowest frequency of I think 5 minutes,which is more than enough.Great product! Fantastic value for money!This is a very weird product.There is wax in our ears, so this producthelps you to take out the wax through an LED.You shouldn't do this on your own.So, please don't try to do it yourself,it has to be done with someone.That someone also needs to be very patient.I am the only patient person in my house,so I am the one who does this processevery month for the whole family.So, first Ruchi lies down,then Vidhur lies down,Uzma lies down. Nobody cleansmy ears but I use an earbud becauseI find it safer. But it is sucha nice happy product and you willsee how it actually works. That LED flashesand if you clean your ears in darkthen you will be very focused.I don't know if you'd like this or notbut I actually like cleaning ears.I don't know why. It is not a fetishbut it is just something that we look forwardto as a family, as weird as it sounds.OkThis pen, I cannot begin to tell youSo I have been for the longest time,a fountain pen fan.I use an ink pen to write, the one is inwhich you fill ink, a cartridge,and an inkpot, all those things.I used to use that until this pencame to my life.This is Air Pen by Uniball.It is such a brilliant pen to work with.I am such a fan that all my fountain pensare finished and now I havedeviated to this pen.Incredible purchase!The best hands-down penthat I have bought for this money!Along with it, my favorite thing,my notebook.This notebook is by Nappa Dori.I love it!It's slightly expensive for just a notebook.I think it's for around â¹700,but I like the really nice feel to it.It's very elegant and sophisticated.I, of course, make all my noteson pieces of paper and this notebook.So, I love it!I have a stack of notebooks at my house.I have 5-6-10 copies.Whenever it's finished, I take another one.I'm a big fan!Our house is all about organic there isa great product called Use Me!and these are basically buntings,which are decorations.Now the problem with us is that if thereis a celebration for children, or Diwalior anything like that, you will use thosebuntings or those decorative thingsand once the celebrations are over thenyou have to throw them away,which is not really environmental-friendly.So these are buntings that are made from,number 1, cloth, which is reusable,no new cloth is used in it instead it iscreated by joining together different cloths,and second, it is reusable, so once yourparty is over, you wrap it up and keep it aside,and then use it for the next party.We like it this way.Use Me! has many such buntingsor many other renewable or reusableproducts which you can access,but this is one of our favorites becausethese cupcakes buntings are greatfor children's parties.For some weird reason is Uzma and Vidurdrink their milk through a straw, theyreally love it! Actually, Vidur not so muchbut Uzma does it, and we also feelthat it is a good way to control theamount that you are drinkingand to be actually confused of it.But we do not use plastic straws becausethat is of course not environment-friendly.Not even paper, because ultimatelythat is also being used. So we lovethese steel straws, it is a pack of 4.It can be cleaned up nicely. If youdo not have a problem with somebody elseusing it, which is very prevalent in India,but we don't have it, we just clean the straw,and then it is ready for use again.If anybody wants to use it,they can easily use it.But this is a great product if you careabout the environmentand if you care about straws.In the same environment feeling,paper tissues or paper napkins whichare reusable or, sorry, not reusable,how can they be reusable?!Once againIn the same theme of environment,paper tissues which are environment friendly.So they are made out of bambooand they are really really good.They are just as good as any othertissue paper but the good thing is thatthey have been made inan environment-friendly manner.We always use this only.This is a product by Beco and one of the thingsthat we absolutely love under â¹1000.In the same feeling of environment,toothbrushes made out of bamboo.The biggest problem with toothbrushesis that they are made of plasticand when you dispose them off,it adds to the environmental degradation.So, we use bamboo toothbrushes,because bamboo can be renewedand it will be circulated again.So once we use it, bristles are antibacterialso they automatically fizzle out in some time,you remove those bristles, then you canput that bamboo toothbrush in a plant or soiland in some time, it will decompose,adding back to the environment.No damage and you are also happy.This is a great product.At some point in India, I don't know why,but wipers became very important.So wiper is very important in our houseas well because if the bathroomor some other place is wet,and I was sick and tired of bad qualitycheap wipers. The plastic used is ofbad quality, wiper doesn't work properly,they don't clean properly,so until I found this wiper by Scotch Brite,it almost sounds likeCut this partIt's a very good wiper. It is such a great thing,I am feeling weird while making thisvideo because I am talking about such things,people must be thinking,'What are you talking about?Why are we talking about wiperson YouTube video?!'But you will understand that thesesmallest of things, add so much convenienceif you pick it the right way. Many timeswe try to save money on these small things,so we go for something cheaper whichbreaks down very fast, but if we spenda bit and buy a good quality product,then it makes such a big difference overa period of time that you will alwaysappreciate it, at least I do because thesesmall things are very important,so for me, a good wiper is very important,because ultimately, I am wipingsome or the other time, whether it'sthe windows or the floors,and I want something which isworth my time, does not involve a lot of effort,does not make me irritated.Then comes one more thing which is a kadhai.If we are talking about a wiper, a toothbrush,then why not a kadhai.I think we bought this kadhaiaround 2 years back.It is a cast iron kadhai, so it is actuallymade of iron, there is no layer,no Teflon coating, it's not non-stick.Food will stick to it, but it is made of cast ironso it doesn't stick that much.The good thing is because it is madeof actual iron, so that iron will go inyour body gradually, which helps you inyour hemoglobin, which helps youin just covering up any iron deficiencythat you may have.We love using this, and we don't havea microwave in our house, so we don'tuse a microwave, there is no instant heatingin our house, every food item is heatedagain in this Kadhai only and that iswhy this is such a great product.Highly recommended!If you do not trust it, then please tellyour parents about this product, hopefully,if they are fond of good quality stuff,then they will not scold you that,'Why are you talking about such things?Do you have a lot of money?',then you will be able to convincethem to buy one.Soundproof and noiseless mouse by Logitech,so when it is clicked it doesn't make any noise,which is great, I really like it,I am guessing you do as well.Brilliant product!It feels really good when you can actuallymove forward without any click click sound.One of my best purchases for less than â¹1000.You can get all these products as a giveaway,how? Keep watching the video.Aditya, use this line after every 3-4 productsbecause I just spoke about that.One more item from kitchen becauseI find myself in kitchen many times.If you have a good knife and a good peelerthen your experience of cooking food getselevated so much that I cannot evenbegin to tell you, at least for me thatis so true, especially peeler.If the peeler is bad, then that is soirritating because you are strugglingto peel potatoes and mangoes,but it's not working, it gets stuck somewhereor something else happens.This peeler and knife set by Victorinox is brilliant.This knife is very important.There is another one available, not that.This one is with stripes,and it cuts onions very smoothly.I am still feeling odd making this videoand you must be thinking,'What the F is this guy all about?!',but genuinely these are the productsthat I use in my life, which I am so gratefulfor because these small things addso much to the efficiency and justnatural well-being of your life.This is a great product.I cannot show you but it iseverywhere on my table.You will see how it works.This product is made to control yourwires and manage them properly.You can stick it anywhere on your table,maybe on your almirah, on yourbedside table, anywhere.Very very convenient!Helps to manage mess, I suffered a little bitfrom OCD, so I do not like scattered wires.Everything needs to be like,'Oh, this wire! Pull it and leave it back'.I like it on my table, it is exactlythe way it is right now.Great product! Please do consider.And finally while playing tennis,there is a concept of tennis elbow,which is a very important and frequentlyoccurring injury while playing any racket sport.If you do not play, this may not beapplicable to you. But to protect myelbow while I am playing tennis,I use this elbow band by LP, so that it keepsmy elbow intact and I do not sufferfrom tennis elbow.All these products are for less than â¹1000.All these products impact my lifemeaningfully and I would love for youto also experience all these products.Giveaway, how will it work?For each product that I mentioned,I will give out 5 of those as a giveaway.The way that this will work is,you have to go and write in thecomment section which product do youwant and the reason why you want it.For every product that I showcased here,5 winners will be randomly selected,not randomly, but on the basis ofwhy you need that product, and then theywill be sent this absolutely free of coston my behalf through Amazon.If you want to buy them all the linksare there in the description andin the pinned comment as well.All these are affiliate links, when youbuy them I get an affiliate revenuewhich I used to sponsor the educationof kids that cannot afford their educationon their own.
