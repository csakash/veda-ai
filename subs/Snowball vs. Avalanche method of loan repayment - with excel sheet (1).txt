If you have a lot of loans running,and you want to repay them quickly,then what are the ways to do that?2 ways that we will discuss in this video.The snowball payment methodand the avalanche payment method.What is the snowball payment method?The snowball payment method is thatyou will first start with the small loansand gradually slowly increase themand go to the big ones.This is called the snowball effect.There is not much snow in Indiabut because I am from Kashmir,I know that when you throwa small ball of snow from a mountain,it is small in the beginningbut as it falls it tendsto accumulate more snow,and by the time it reaches the bottom,it becomes a very big snowball.That's exactly how we'll treat our loans.If we have a lot of loans,then we will start repayingthe small loan first,and as soon as it is paid,we will quickly pay the next oneand then the next one,till we get to the bigger loanthat is there.To know all this,let's try to understand itwith an Excel sheet.Let's play with Excel!Ive taken two loans for simplicity sake.The first loan is of â¹10,000,15% is its rate of interest,and assume that you have takena personal loan,the loan is for 36 months so 3 years,and your monthly EMI comes to about â¹350.The second loan is of â¹1 lakh,let's say it was a car loan.Its rate of interest is 9%,this is a 5-year loan so 60 months,and its EMI is about â¹2,100.The snowball payment methodsays that first of all,we'll try to repay the first loan in full.Why?Because its EMI is the lowest.So you have all your loans,these are only two,God forbid if you have more than two,I'm saying God forbid becausethere should not be many loans in life.So it's not a thing to be proud of.But if it is, then we'll pay it slowly.So you will put all the loansin descending order, meaningwhich is the highest EMI to whichis the lowest EMI, in that order.And you will try to repay the loanwith the lowest EMI first.How will you pay now?You will ask yourselfwhat is my capacity or capabilityto pay EMI every month.In this case, I assume thatour capacity is â¹3,000.So we cannot pay EMI of more than â¹3,000,my salary allows this much only.So our EMI right now comes aroundto â¹2,400,forget about the dollar, it is in rupees.So we have the ability to givearound â¹600 or â¹575 or â¹580 more.So we will try to pay â¹580 extrain the first loani.e. the smallest loan of every monthtill it gets over.And then when that gets over,the same â¹580 plus the EMIof the first loan, which is â¹350,we will try to repay the second loanwith that.We will not take a new loan, ok.How does it really work in real life?Let's look at this.So let's try to understand this.Firstly, the first loan is of â¹10,000.We paid the first EMI of â¹350 approx.Out of this, the interest is â¹125,and the principal is â¹222.As you may be aware, when you pay a loan,a large part of the EMI initiallygoes toward the interest,and a part goes toward the principal.So we say, out of â¹350,â¹222 went towards the principal.But we paid the extra â¹580 also.This happens through a prepayment option.So you will have to do this prepaymentevery month towards the principal amount.You will go to the bank and say,don't reduce my EMI.EMI will remain the same,but you will reduce my tenurewhich means you will reducethe loan duration which in this caseis 3 years.So next month you again pay the same EMI,again the same â¹578 extra,and you see that you repaythe 36-month loan within just 13 months.That means you paid it in 1/3rd time only.The interest you paid was around â¹1,400,which means you gave â¹1,400over and above â¹10,000 to the bank,because you were paying an extra amountof about â¹580.When you paid off the loan in 13 months,you go on to the second loan.Let's work on the second loan,and this is its story.We were on a loan of â¹1 lakh,and our EMI was around â¹2,000 or â¹2,100,out of which â¹750 is our interestand around â¹1,326 is our principal,which keeps changing every month.Initially, we cannot makeany additional payment.Why?Because we are repaying the previous loan,which is â¹580.As soon as this loan is paid off,we come here,and we start making an additional paymentof â¹924.Now where did this â¹924 come from?This is 578 which we have extraplus 347 of the previous loan as well,because now we don't have topay that loan.So we will not foolishly take a new loan,we'll try to clear all the previous loans.So adding that 347 plus 578, we get 924,and that's what we're goingto start paying, again extra.So the rate at which our amountwas decreasing every month,the amount will start decreasing fasterthan that because we are paying this â¹924.You will see that we paid the loanof 60 months within 48 months only.This is called the snowball effect.Let's call it the snowball effect only.It is called the snowball payment method.Now let's see the numbers.So in the snowball payment method,we paid interest of around â¹24,107which was over and above the principlewe had taken from the bank.â¹1 lakh from one loan and â¹10,000from the earlier loan.So over and above â¹1,10,000 we paidaround â¹24,000.If we did not pay this extra amount,then we would have paid â¹27,000,which means through this snowball effect,we saved around â¹3,000 in interest.Now this looks like what's the big dealin saving â¹3,000!But this loan amount is also very less.But let's see by changing it.If we assume that we had takena personal loan of â¹1 lakhand not â¹10,000,and we have taken a home loanof â¹50 lakhs,then you will see thatthe numbers are pretty big.Now the monthly EMI is around â¹1,07000.And you have the capacityto pay â¹1,25,000,so you can additionallypay around â¹18,000 more.So you will go throughthe exact same exercise,where you will say that,I will pay â¹18,000 extrain the first loan.So the 36-month loan will be paid offin 5 months itself.And when it is paid off in 5 months,you will start paying â¹21,208 extrafor the 2nd loan which is the home loan,and that is paid off in 54 monthsinstead of 60 months.You can keep changing the numbershowever you want.Maybe this one is not 60 but 120,and here it is â¹1,00,000 or â¹80,000instead of â¹1,25,000,so you can only give â¹13,000 extra.So let's see how this works.You did all this.Let's say you can't give this money,so you will then havean average interest of â¹26,23,000.But since you started payingthis extra amount,you pay an extra amount of â¹13,200,you will actually save 1,58,000from the snowball payment method.Notice that I didn't say snowball effect,but I just said it.So you save around â¹1,60,000.So this is money that you save,you are not paying this extra.You have paid the principal amount.But if you did not pay this extra amount,then you would have to payan additional â¹1,60,000 more on topof this amount,but now you will not have to pay that.Let's go to the opposite method calledthe avalanche payment method.What is an avalanche?Many avalanches do not happen in India,thankfully.But an avalanche happenswhen a huge snowstorm comesfrom the top of the mountain itself,so it starts with a really big oneand that is the methodwe use to repay the loan.So it's exactly the opposite.Instead of starting withthe smallest loan,we start with the largest loan.So we'll start paying offthe largest loan first,when those are paid off,then we'll move on to the smaller loans,and so on and so forth,and we'll see how that works.So let's talk about the avalanche method.And now since the numbers have changed,for the avalanche method,we will first pay the â¹50 lakh loan.Actually, let's keep it the same.So it's â¹10,000, 1,00,000, 60,and this can be 3,000, okay?And let's just seehow much it is without this method.So it is around 6.And when we apply this method...Perfect, okay?Let's look at the avalanche method.Our loan was of â¹1,00,000,our EMI was around â¹2,100,the interest of â¹750, principal of â¹1,326,and we can give extra â¹578,we will give what we can.And we will keep doing thistill the loan is over.So our loan ends in 50 monthsinstead of 60 months.But you know what?Our previous loan was only for 36 months,so it ended in 36 months itself.So it has gotten overat the 36th month itself.So both of our loans are paid off.And to give you a sense,we paid interest of â¹25,664 throughwhich we saved around â¹1,300.Now you will feel likein the avalanche method,we saved almost half the amount only,why should we use it?That's because the numbers are such thatit gave you the indication.If this number would be fora very long duration,then suddenly the avalanche methodbecomes a better one.So let's do the pros and cons of this.By the way, this Excel sheetis pinned for you,so you can use it after downloading itand play around with it.But I will give you the benefitsand disadvantages of the snowballand the avalanche payment methods.What are the advantages ofthe snowball payment methodof loan repayment?First of all, it feels like a quick win.Small money for small loans,we start seeing an effect very quickly.So it gives you a sense of accomplishment,a sense of action,which is a great sign whenyou are trying to get donewith all your debts.It also helps a lot in your credit score,because as your loans are paid off,your credit score will start improving,which will allow you to getbetter interest ratesfor any further loans,which by the way you should not take,but if you have to,then you will geta better rate of interest.But the biggest disadvantagevery clearly is since you startwith a smaller loan,the bigger loans that are goingto cost you a lot of interestwill be ignored until this smaller loanis cleared.So it may not work,and that's why it has to besolved mathematically to figure outwhich payment methodout of the two is better,so that you save more interest payments.The avalanche payment methodhas great benefits.Number 1:Because you start with a bigger loan,your interest is mostly savedvery meaningfully,because you are able to clearthose loans faster.Number 2:Since these are big loans as well,if they are cleared quickly,then your ability to clear the restof the loan becomes very high,because you are paying a very high EMIfor this loan, and when it is cleared,you can use that big EMIfor the other loanswhere the EMI is lesser.Frankly, the disadvantagesare psychological.Since these are big loans,and if we try to pay them offin the beginning,we feel as if we are trying to movea mountain,and we are not able to do too much.So the effect, as we saw,a loan of 60 months will be clearedin 50 months,so you will anywhere have to waitfor 5 years to clear that loan.But if we clear the first loan throughthe snowball method,we cleared a loan of 3 yearsin just 13 months,and that makes you feel like,Great! One loan is clearand we can move on.So the psychological effectof the avalanche method is far greaterbecause it seems that thingsare moving very slowly.And secondly, as it is obvious,since you have many active loansbecause it is focusing onlyon the highest EMI,so because of these active loans,it's not necessary that your credit scorewill improve.The credit score is not dependenton the total amount of loans you have,but it depends on the numberof individual active loans.The more you close them,the better your credit score gets.So in conclusion, both of these methodscan work efficiently dependingon the nature of your loansand how many loans you have.Please try to solve this mathematically.That if we start repaying one loan,by when it will be repaid,then the second after that,then the third after that,and so on and so forth.And these two methods are super helpfulfor you to clear your loans faster.A large personal advice about loans.If possible in life, take only two loans,one for education and the other for home.You should not need to take a loanfor anything else.If you have to, and especiallyfor something you're buyingto show the world,whether it's a phone, clothes, car,or anything else,please resist the temptation.Debt is a trap.If you get stuck in it,then will be very difficultfor you to free yourself.I am speaking from my personal experienceof how I saw my fatherand thus us suffer throughthat entire loan repayment process.I don't want anyone to go throughthat process ever in their life.On that note, I hope this was helpful,Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
