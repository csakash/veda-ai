Check 1, 2. Check.I was recently watching a videobetween Hemant Pantand Shubham Sethi.There was a very interestingconversation where Hemant wasasking Shubham that howdid he retire at the age of 29.Shubham retired at theage of 31 with â¹5.5 crores.And now he is not working for money.In this video,I will try to show youShubham's methodthrough Excel sheetso that you can alsofollow the same journey.But before that, 3 things.Number 1: Retirement does notmean that you stop working.That is a misconception.It was put in our mindby our parents thatretirement means thatwe will retire one day.And after that, we willenjoy the retired life.We will drink tea, read anewspaper, go for a walk.No.In today's world,retirement meansthat you do not needto work for money.So that is the firstdefinition you need to know of.It does not mean at allthat you will stop working.But you will notwork for money.Number 2:It is not at all necessarythat you retire before 30 years.That FIRE, FinanciallyIndependent, Retire Early phase,it is not necessary that youhave to do it before 30 years.Otherwise, life is a waste.You can take thisdecision at any point,whenever you want,without taking any risk.In this video, I'll also show you atwhat point you shouldtake that decision,and how to run the rest of your life.Number 3: It worked for Shubham.It will work on the Excel sheet.It is not necessary thathe will work in real life.So whenever you are ready totake a decision at this point,think before you take itinstead of thinking thatI saw it on YouTube,Ankur Warikoo said thatShubham has done it,then I should also do it.Take this decisionwith your intelligence,with your thinking,with your judgement.Let's understand the approach.The first basis ofapproach is thatthere is an amountof retirement.We have to chase that amount.And we have to investtowards that amount.What is that amount?25 times of your annual expenses.It does not meanthat you will liveyour whole lifewith that amount.But if you use thatamount in the right way,then you will never needmoney on an average.So let's use numbers.Assume that your monthly expense is â¹50,000.You can change it.I will put it here.I will make it green here.It means that you canchange this number.By the way,you can download thisExcel sheet anduse it for yourself.Assume that your monthlyexpense is â¹50,000.It means that your annual expense is â¹6,00,000.How much is 25 times of this?â¹1.5 crores.And this is your retirement income.So we have to chase this numberbecause the day we get this number,we can technically retire that day.So step number 1 is to knowthis retirement amount.Whichever is your monthlyexpense for today,its annual sum and its 25 times.Step number 2:What do you have to do toreach this retirement income?Don't take too much risk.Don't try to reach overnight.Don't do stupidity.Slowly and easily,and I will show you how.Assume that your monthlysalary is â¹1,00,000.Out of which your monthlyexpense is â¹50,000.So let's make it â¹1,00,000.So you can invest theremaining â¹50,000 of the month.Where do you have to invest this?Just like I said, don't take risk.We will invest in somethingcalled Index Mutual Fund.There are many indexesin Indian Stock Exchange.The most fundamentalis Nifty 50 Index.It is a mutual fund ofIndia's top 50 stocks.If you put money in it,as India's top 50 companies perform,your money will also perform.If you want to take more risk,you can invest in MidCap 100.This is the index of India'stop 100 mid-sized companies.If you want to take more risk,you can invest in SmallCap 250.These are India's top 250small-sized companies.My suggestion is thatto reach this amount,don't take too much risk.This money will be createdfrom the stock market,but put Nifty 50 IndexMutual Fund in it.On an average, it willprovide you 12% annual return.This is backed by historical data.On an average, you get12-13% from Nifty 50 Index.If you investâ¹50,000 of the month as SIP,and start by earning 12%,let's see how much this moneywill become after how many years.Remember, you haveto reach â¹1.5 crore.So that will be your starting point.So after 5 years, this amountwill be around â¹41 lakhs.After 10 years, â¹1.15 crores.After 11 years, â¹1.36 crores.After 12 years, â¹1.59 crores.This means that within 12 years,you have reached this amount.So at any age,suppose you are 23 or 24 years old,you can retire at the age of 35.If you reach this amount earlier,you can retire earlier.If it takes more time,you don't have to rush.You can retire at the pointwhen you have this money.This is the simple wayof thinking about it.Now you will say thatin these 12 years,My monthly expense willincrease from â¹50,000.Of course, it is increasing.But according to that,your monthly salaryshould also increase.Whatever it is increasing,at 4% to 5%,or if you are in a fast growth industry,then from 8% to 10%.Whatever rate it is increasing at,or on an average,whatever is increasing on an average,with that average, increase yourexpenses and your investment.We have assumed that you areinvesting only â¹50,000 every month.If it is a little more,then you will reach earlier.It should not be less,because your salary is also increasing.So you have to adjust with that.It has been simplified a little,but understanding the process is more important.Now you have reached step 2.What was step 1?That you have determinedyour retirement income.What was step 2?At what point did youreach that income?You have not taken any risk.We have invested in Nifty 50 Index.When you reach that point,and you will retire witha corpus of â¹1.59 crores,how will you live the life after that?For this, Shubham told avery interesting approach.In my head, it is a 50-50 approach with an 8-year horizon.What he did was,this â¹1.6 crores,we will use 50% of it for expenses.So whatever will beour monthly expenses,for that, we will use 50%and we will use it for 8 years.So let's see in the numbers.It is around â¹80 lakhs.So our amount permonth is â¹83,000.It means we have a budget ofâ¹83,000 per month to spend.The remaining money, whichis another â¹80 lakhs,we will do the same againas we have done before.We will put it in theIndex Mutual Fund.It will earn 12% on an average.So after 8 years,this same â¹80 lakhswill become â¹1.97 crores.This will be a lump sum investment.It will not have any SIP.We have put back 50% of the money.We will rotate thisâ¹1.97 crores again.So,50% for expenses,for 8 years.So, we will use â¹98lakhs for expenses.Meaning, now our monthly expenseshave increased to â¹1,02,000.Meaning, now our monthly expenseshave increased to â¹1,02,000.And the remaining â¹98 lakhs,we will invest it againin the Index Mutual Fund.It will earn 12%.After 8 years, its valuewill be Rs. 2.44 crores.We will keep repeating this process.50%, so we willget â¹1.22 crores.Meaning, our amount of expenseshas become â¹1.27 crores.So on and so forth.When you start doing this,you realize that you willnever run out of money.Now of course,And you will always havemoney for two things.Number 1: To manageyour monthly expenses.Number 2: Your corpus with whichyou can live the rest of your life.Now with this corpus,we can do a lot of things,because it is notthat we will spendour monthly expenses in â¹1.5 lakhs.Where will the children'seducation come from?If we have to buy a house forourselves, where will it come from?If we have to make a biginvestment, where will it come from?It will come from this corpus only,because this corpus will give you infinite mileage at some point.because this corpus will give youinfinite runway at some point.Meaning, whatever yearsyou have left in your life,let's take it on an averagethat you will live for80 years or 85 years.So if this money keepsearning 12% income,Then you will neverrun out of money.In fact, you will have excesseven at the time of your death.So you can back calculate this as a lump sum investment.So you can back calculatethis as a lump sum expense.So you can say at any point thatout of â¹3.74 crores, I willuse â¹1 crore for the house,or I will use â¹50 lakhs for something.Whatever you have left, if youapply the 50-50 rule again,the cycle will continue.I had made a videoabout 2 years ago,which was very similarto how this is.And the videos...I had made a videoabout 2 years ago ofhow much money do youneed in your life?All the needs of yourlife, all the desires,how much money do you needto fulfil everything?For me, that number is â¹21.7 crores.because I have to go to Mars,I have to get my children educated,I have to do something.And if we take the month's expenses,and take a number of â¹21.7 crores,then those â¹21.7 croreswill end very soonif they are spent without thought.So the only waythat you can liveyour whole life witha small lump sumis for you toinvest a part of thatmoney into a returngenerating asset.In this case, as Shubham said,can be an index mutual fundwhich will give you 12%.So in summary, whatwere the 3 steps?Step number 1: Determineyour retirement income.What will that be?Your month's expenses,converted into annual expenses,multiplied by 25 times.Number 2: To reach this income,you have to investas much as possible,and get to this numberwithout taking a lot of risk.Without taking risk,not without,but with less risk,what approach can you adopt?SIP in the index mutual fund.So, your monthly investment,put it in the index mutual fund.Nifty 50 will be a good start.To take a little more risk,MidCap 100.To take a little more risk,SmallCap 250.But beyond these three,honestly, there won't be any need.Index mutual fund will be good.If you invest in it,on an average,you will earn 12%.So after a few years,your retirement income will be hit.That will be step number 2.After that, step number 3.Divide this corpus 50-50.You use 50% for yourmonth's expenses.Use it for 8 years.And the remaining 50%,invest in lump sumso that you can earn a return for 8 years.Why 8 years?I think, I don't knowthe answer exactly.but I think it's enough periodfor you to have a consistent returnover a period of time.If you do less than that, thenthere will be more ups and downs.You won't be able toget a consistent return.There won't be a compounding effect.If you do more than that,you won't be able to waitbecause your expenses are necessary.So, 8 years seems like a good pointfor you to reconsider.So 8 years seems likea good point to start.Do a 50-50 split, and then,execute the same process again.You can execute thisfor as long as you want.If there is a big expense in life,then, after 8 years,take it out from the same corpus,and count it as a one-time expense,and with the remaining process,and with the remaining amount,adopt the same 50-50 approach,and keep moving forward.I found this to be a powerful,very simplistic approach,but at least,a good way for you to thinkbecause if you start plotting yournumbers through this Excel sheet,you will get some direction.The big thing I wantall of you to take away,is thatretirement should not be a goal.You have to retire early.This should not be the purpose of life.The purpose of life should be,  you earn money well,learn well,and at any point,you are not running after moneyby killing your life.If you feel that,that is the way youwould want to live life,and you want to do itfor 50-60 years,very good.Retire only when you arereally 60 years old,and the age of retirement will arrive.If you feel that,you don't want to participatein the corporate race.You want to live life on your own,or any other reason,then don't chase that retirement.Work towards itand at some point of time,you will hit it.At that point,withdraw courage,and retireand start working for yourself,not for money.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
