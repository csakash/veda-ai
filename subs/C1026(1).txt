Check 1 2 ok let's get started.How much money do you need in life?How much money would beenough for you to fulfillevery dream, every needin your life?Let's get to know in this video.Friends, in my newsletter,if you have not subscribedto my newsletterthen you can do so,where I have a veryopen conversation,I share whatever is going onin my mind,and I just send it out tothousands of people,around 70,000 people get thatnewsletter every week.Last week in my newsletter, I discussedthe topic which was,How much money do you really need?And the reason whythis question is importantis that if we do not knowhow much money we are working for,then for our whole lifewe keep working only for money.If we do not know we are goingtowards what goal, what target,then whatever we get wouldnever be enough.I remember I asked a lot of people,What do you think how muchdo you need in life?And people give random answers.â¹100-200-300 crores,some people would say â¹20-30 lakhsis enough,and both of these are atthe opposite end of two spectrums.One is a person who doesn't knowhow much they really need in life,so they ask for so much,that everything can come under this.And another person who thinksthat little money would be enough,because they haven't extrapolatedanything for the future.And that I think isthe biggest problem.If you would not try to findthe answer to the question thathow much do you really need in life,then you will always keep chasing money.I found the answer to this questionfor myself at the age of 23,and for the last 20 yearsI have re-evaluated that numberevery year,and that number has more or lessstayed in the same ballpark.At the age of 23, I found out thatto live my life and do whateverI want to do,I need around â¹20 crores.If I do the same calculation today,then the number stays the same.Now, when I share that with people,it got them interested.'Hey, how did you arriveat this number?How do you know that you needthis specific number?'So the specific numberis â¹21.7 crores.And I thought of creatinga video on this,so this is a video wherewe will play with Excel,and try to findhow much money do you really need in life.I will take my example,and based on the example,you can use all the stepsto find that number for yourself,according to your current circumstancesand your age,and I hope that that will give youa lot more clarity about what is itthat you are actually chasing.So let's start the Excel.The approach is very simple.The approach is that you willconsider your current expensesand make a future projection of them,and do it as meticulouslyas possible for better results.Then you will consideryour future expenses,the expenses that you knowyou will have to incur,if you are in your 20s,then you may want to buy a house,a car, you would need moneyfor your marriage,children's fees,once you get marriedand have childrenthen their education,whatever the case may be,you will keep all that in mindand extrapolate that as well.And then we will applya factor which isthe unpredictability factor.Anything can happenat any time in life,so we cannot account for everything,so we will consider a numberand move ahead with it.This way we will getan excellent annualcash flow statement,which will show approximatelyhow much money we would need every year,and that will then be usedto calculate,if you would getall the money right now,then how much money would beenough for the whole of your life?Here is how we do it.I will start with my assumption sheet.I recently created a video onHow do I spend my money?Whatever money we get,how do we distribute it inwhich different things every year?So I am going to use thatas the starting example.So I have assumed inflationto be 5%.This is an average expectation,it could be more or less,but the unpredictability factorwill take care of it.Here is that yearly expenseon items that I currently have.I am 41 years old right now.These are the expensesfor 2021-22 when I was 40 years old,and this is the precise number,as precise as I could get.We spent â¹19,000 on clothes.Around 20 on health insurance.â¹22,000 on eating out.We send our children to a library,so we paid â¹25,000 annuallyfor both the kids.Subscriptions which includemobile phones,Netflix, the internet,and YouTube,all the subscriptionswere around â¹30,000.We spent 30,000 on books.Gifting people on birthdaysand anniversaries was around â¹36,000.Electricity, maintenance ofwhere you live, â¹1,32,000 for that.Around â¹1,40,000 for life insurance.Cooking food in the housefor around â¹2,60,000.Our car is on rent, it's petrol,and everything elsewas around â¹3,60,000.Things for the house, like groceries,expenses on all the helps and driver,all of that for â¹3,50,000.Travel, every year we spendaround â¹5 lakh on travel,on our vacation.School fee is a big investment,so â¹10 lakhs is children's school fees.And the EMI on the houseis around â¹18 lakhs.This is something that we know.This is something that youalso know.Whatever age you are at,you should know your current expenses.You may not know all the expensesfor the future,but you surely knowwhat are your current expenses.Now the big thing is, after that,you plot a projection,about its growth.Now, this has nothing to dowith inflation, you can connect itwith inflation,but this is your own viewabout how it grows.For example, I know my expenseon clothes will grow by 5%as per the inflation.I am not very fond of buying clothes,we shop for whatever is neededfor children, and so on.I know that for health insurance,it will definitely grow 1%ahead of inflation.As we grow, the need for thisinsurance will also grow,I have assumed it as 6% overall.Eating out is at 5%.Kid's library will grow by 6%because it is expensivebut when I would be 50 years old,this is when I am 42 years old,when I will be 50 years old,one of our children will pass outfrom school, then their librarywould be stopped,and then after another six years,we will stop it for the other kid,and then it would be zero.Subscriptions would keep growingat 5% because of inflation.Books will grow at 6%,because as we grow old,we will be more free,so we will read more books.Gifts at 5%.Electricity, maintenancewill keep growing at 6%.Life insurance is the sametill 52 years,the life insurance I'll have to buyafter that will be very expensive,so I have taken that into account as well.I think food expenses will grow at 8%,because food, in general,is becoming expensive,especially the type of foodwe should eat,organic food, healthy food,so on and so forth.Car rental: I have assumedthat the car rental wouldremain the same,but petrol will keep growingby 5% because of inflationtill 50 years.After that, it will growby 0% up to 80.Why?Because I believe that in thenext 8-9 years, electric vehicleswill stop that growth,so that petrol expensewill decrease, but I havetaken the growth as zerobecause it will keep increasingbecause of inflation.Home expenses at 8%, most of yourexpenses will keep increasing.I have assumed travel to be at 10%because as we grow old,kids will also go to schooland college, and we will travel more,because that's what we will be able to do.School fee: Education is becomingthe most expensiveso I have assumed it at 8%.Again, by the age of 50,one child will pass out school,and another one by 56.Home EMI is left for 10 years,which is â¹18 lakhs,so that has to be paid.Then what are the plans for the future?If you are in your early 20s,then your car, house, marriage, kids,all of it can be planned,but all of that is to be usedas of current price.So the question will be,if you would needall those things today,then how much would they be for?And then we will adjust itfor inflation.For example, college isthe biggest expense that will bethere for us in the future.Colleges for both the kids,I don't know if they would evengo to college or not,but if they do, then naturallythey may want to go out of India,then that is very expensive.So if I look at a good US education today,then including scholarship,and living expenses,it's close to â¹1.5 crores.So that's what I have taken,as of today, we would need â¹1.5 crores,but at the age of 49,when the first kid would startgoing to college,and we will grow it by 6%,so I will grow it a littlemore than inflation.The second kid at the age of 55,I will grow that also by 6%.And there are two thingsthat I want to do in my life.One is a trip to Mars,this is the dream of my life,I don't know how many of you know,but from the very beginning,I wanted to go to Mars.In fact, I wanted to bea space scientist,and that's why I went to the USAto do my Ph.D.I dropped out of that,and that's when I decidedif I am not able to go thereacademically, then hopefully,maybe I can go there through money.Elon Musk will make that dream come true,so I believe that this will happenat some point in time.So I have planned thatat the age of 55,I will take a trip to Mars.I am very certain that by that time,a trip to Mars would bea very normal process.This trip would be at leastfor â¹3 crores.I am growing it at 1%.Why?Because this trip would becomecheaper and cheaper,it would not become expensive,because technology will becomecheaper and cheaper.And then the second thingis the foundation.When I would be 60 years old,I want to start a foundationthat will help kids with their education.As of today, I am assumingthe starting to be at â¹5 crores,that will be the foundation.The â¹5 crores will be reinvestedagain and again,and help in the kids' educationas much as possible.So I will start that at the age of 60.So I am assuming that â¹5 croreswill keep increasing by 5%, accordingto the inflation, so whatever wouldbe its value at the age of 60,that will be the expense.This is the most important thingthat you need to spend time on.If you do this diligently,everything else isa mathematical calculation.This is the approach thatI followed even when I was 23,and I have shared the templatewith you, and even today when I do that.So let's see the numbers now.First of all, age.I started at the age of 40,and I went all the way to 100.So I have planned for 100 years.I know for sure thatI'll die before that,but if I manage to live till 100,then this much money would be enough.And simple math, these arethe exact numbers that I spentin my 40th year,and basis our assumption here,we will start growing them.And that is how it will work.For example, let's lookat life insurance.As I said, life insurance isthe same till the age of 52,but after 52,if I would want to take life insurance,then I have assumed that itwill be very expensive.So I have made it 10 timesSo instead of paying â¹1,43,000 per year,I would be paying â¹14,30,000,because I would want my lifeto be insured till that time.If in case something happens to me,then there is something totake care of my family,in terms of at least money,and so on and so forth.Home EMI will stopat the age of 52.Nothing would be left after that,our house will be free,all these things.And then you have your future expenses.Kid's college was at â¹1.5 croresas of today.When I would have to use itat the age of 49,it would be around â¹3 crores.This means, at the age of 49,I should have â¹3 croresto be able to affordthe education of my first kid.At the age of 55, these 1.5 croreswould be â¹4 crores 75 lakhs.So at the age of 55,I would need â¹4 crores 75 lakhsto be able to afford the educationof the second child.Then the foundation,we have to start at â¹5 crores,and at the age of 60, thoseâ¹5 crores would be equal to â¹13 crores.This means, if I want to startthat foundation at the age of 60,then I should have â¹13 croresto get that foundation done.And then finally, a trip to Mars.If at the age of 55, I would haveto pay â¹3 crores of today's value,then I believe that at the age of 55,I would have to pay aroundâ¹4 crores for that trip.So you will add all of these.This will tell you,every year approximatelyhow much expense would you havein that year, not at today's prices,but at that year's prices.For example, if at the age of 40,I used to spend â¹47 lakhsannually on everything,then if I have to see the same thingat the age of 50,it would be â¹77 lakhs.This is simply the growththat I have assumed, of course,inflation and other thingsaccounted for.After this comes,the unexpected factor.In my life, I have assumedthis unexpected factor to be 25%.That doesn't mean that my lifeis absolutely predictablefor the remaining 75%,and I exactly knowwhat is going to happen.No!It just means thatif I have a buffer of 25%,then I can somehow manage.Life is suchand we have enoughthat we will not starve to death.So with this 25%, somehowbe able to navigate it.So whatever would be the value,an extra 25% of that,then you will get the total needed,which will be the moneythat you will need every single year.It's highly inflated because of this 25%,at least in the early years,you will have the claritythat your expenses would not be so high,but you assume that to be,because how much can happen, right?I am 40, how can I predictthe next 60 years,where I am planning for 100 years?It's impossible, somethingor the other will keep happening.And then you will calculatewhat is called the present valueof that money.What is the present value?Every year, because of inflation,the value of money decreases.If inflation is at 5%, that means,things that you could buyfor â¹100 today,would be for â¹105 in the next year.So the value of â¹100 has decreased,because earlier â¹100 couldbuy all those things,but now they cannot because the rateshave increased to â¹105.So you will back-calculatewhat is the present valueof this money.How do you do that?You adjust for inflation.All of that is inbuilt intothe formula,so you don't have to do anything.Basically, it will tell youthat in the year, for example,at the age of 45,if I would be spending â¹74 lakhsin that year, then its valueas of today, would be â¹61 lakhs,because inflation is reducingthat value by 5%.That's the simple way oflooking at it.If you add all these things,you get what is calledthe total present value,which in my case is â¹41 crores.This means that as of todayif I would have â¹41 crores,then I can do all these things easily.But â¹41 crores is not theactual amount that I need today.Why?If I would have â¹41 crores today,then naturally I would investthem as well,I would receive a return from that,that return would actuallyincrease my money,and inflation will keep reducing it,so there will be an ongoing battle.So you have to find what isthe optimal number that you need today,so that if you invest it,and invest it properly,then that return plus your expenseswill at some point in time balanceeach other.I will say that once more.You don't need â¹41 crores,you need a lot less than that,because if you investthat little amount,then you can generatea surplus from its return,which will then pay for your needs.Let's find out what that number is.So you will assume a few things.First of all, I have assumedthat the annual returnsthat I can get over 60 years,which is crazy, is 10%.The stock market can givemore than that,but I would not invest all the moneyin the stock market,because as the money will grow,I would want some bit of fixed incomecoming through, so maybeI can invest it inthe long term corporate bonds,I might do some FDs,a lot of it would go into equity.Would equity on a long-termkeep giving 13-15% for 60 years,as the last 20-30 years?Not necessarily.So I have assumed 10%.And I have assumed the tax rateto be 33%, because this isthe upper-income bracket,so at some point in time,you will have to give one-thirdto the government,even if it is less or more right now,whatever the case is.So assume the post-tax returnto be 6.7%, which is basicallydeducting 33% from 10%.So if you have a starting capital,let's make that into a...This amount, if you invest this amount,and it gives you a return of6.7% post-tax, then your moneywill gradually keep growing,it will also reduce because of inflation,you have all the expenses as wellwhich you have to cover,so all of that needs to balance itself.You do this through anExcel formula called Goal Seek.It's very simple, don't be scared,you will get the answerin just one click.Here is how you do it.Go to the last 100th year,and you say that all my moneyshould be finished by the 100th year,I don't need any more money.Neither do I have to give it tomy children, nor do I haveto buy a property,whatever the case may be,this is what you are doing.So you will go to Data.What-if analysisand Goal Seek in Data.And you will say,set this cell to zero.And by changing what?By changing the starting capital.Ok.When you do this, you find a number.And this says, if todayI would have â¹22,50,00,000,and I invest it,then how much return would I get?I would get a return ofâ¹1,50,00,000 every yearbecause it is growing by 6.7%.I would have expenses ofâ¹61 lakhs as well,all these expenses,of course we will takethis actual amount which is...I will have expenses as well.So after adding up all thoseexpenses and adding the return,you will actually startgetting a number.As you can see, here ishow the movement will be.And if you plot this on a graph,so you will see this is how it looks.So my money, which is aroundâ¹22 crores, first it will increase,then it will decrease becausea big school fee would haveto be paid,then it will increase again,decrease again,then it will increase again,decrease again,and gradually it will decreasedown to zero.This is how your money will move.And for that, you will have tohave a starting capital of â¹22 crores.This number is slightlymore than 21.7 becausewhen I calculated it last,the numbers were a little less,but you will see that broadlythe ballpark remains the same.And this is the clarity that I need.What I need to know is thatthe day I somehow wouldhave â¹22 crores,I do not have to work for money.â¹22 crores seem to be a lot,but of course,I have a lot of desires,if I try to removeall these things and say,Why do I have to send my childrento such expensive colleges?Why do I have to go to Mars?What is the need to startthe foundation?Why do I have to spendso much on my living expenses?Then of course this numberstarts reducing.So you have to calculatethis number for yourself,and that's why this sheet is there.This sheet is a you-sheet,follow it with the same approach.There will be existing expenseslike current rent, EMI,household expenses, broadlywhatever you can do.The most important thing is,How rapidly will it grow?And in which year there willbe a change or not?And then you will find outyour future expenses,like children's fees,wedding expenses,house expense, car expense,whatever the case may be,taking care of parents, etc.And then you will followexactly the same process.The main thing will bethe Goal Seek.As I said, for Goal Seek,you will assume that bythe 100th year your moneywill be finished,they might get finishedeven before that,but let's assume thatall the money will be finishedby the 100th year,and then you will go to Data,What-If,Goal Seek,set this to 0 by changingthe starting capital,when you do this,you will get a number,and that is the numberyou are going after.I would strongly encourageyou to do this calculationevery year, because every yearyou will have new data coming in.How have your expenses increased?Which new things have you thoughtof that you want to do or not?And you will then reassesswhat that number is,that you are going after.How to reach that number isa completely different conversation.How to generate a side income?How to generate a passive income?How to build assets through investment?All of that, which I createin my videos is how you willget to this number, which for me,is â¹22 crores, and I have to ensurethat I do something whereI don't have to spend my timeto earn this money,because the more I spend my timein earning this money,the more I will just keepearning that money,I will never be truly free.I hope this was usefulin answering the question,How much money do you reallyneed in life?Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
