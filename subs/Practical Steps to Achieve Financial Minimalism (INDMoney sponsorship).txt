There is a very famous novelcalled Catch-22and its author is Joseph Heller.Joseph Hellerhad a very close friend, Kurt.On Joseph's death,Kurt wrote an obituaryfor him in a newspaper.Which is a very beautiful storyand the best introduction to this video.So, Kurt and Joe,he was affectionately called Joe,they were at a party.And this is a true story.So, Kurt says to Joe,Joe do you know that this partyis happening at a millionaire's house.Because it was a splendid party,it was very majestic.He earned more money in one daythan your entire lifetime earningselling the Catch-22 novel.So, Joe said, this is true Kurt.But I have somethingthat this billionaire does not have.And Kurt says, is it?What is this thing that you have,and this millionaire doesn't have.And then Joe says,I have enough.I have enough.It's a beautiful story to start this videoon financial minimalism.What is financial minimalism?That you always knowthat the amount of moneyyou have in your life is enough.And it's a goal to achieve it.Is an aspiration.And I'll tell you why that is.It doesn't meanthat you should be a hermit or a saint.It doesn't mean that you don't buyanything in life for yourself.Don't do it for your family.It means that by adopting some stepsand adopting a mindset,you reach such a point where you knowthat the amount of money you haveis enough for your life.Let's understand what this means.Who is a financial minimalist?A financial minimalist is the one,who doesn't have much debt.Whose expenses are not much.His income is more than his expenses.He regularly invests for a timewhen he won't have any income.And he believes that money has a goal.To achieve all those things in lifewhich makes us happy.No need to run.No need to chase.Need not defeat anyone.Nor need to show anyone.Live life for your own self and happiness.So if a financial minimalist,reaches that pointand imagine that life,where you don't have much loans.Your income is steady.Your expenses are less, are limited.Your income is more than your expenses.Has always been that way.You are constantly investing in a futurewhere even in absence of incomeyou wouldn't have to dependon somebody else.Whatever money you spend every day,every month, every year,you do for your own happiness.Do for your family's happiness.And you still have moneyleft for the future.I think that's a brilliant life to be.But how do you reach here?Let's understand that.Some basic steps.Number One:Decluttering your finances.As in, to achieve productivity,you have to declutteryour environment, your desk.That things are not strewn aroundnot cluttered,because that cognitive loadwon't affect your mind.Similarly, you have to declutteryour financial approach as well.So many bank accounts are open,there are so many credit cards,there are so many expenses,there are so many investments,there are so many incomes.From where to gather them?That is somethingthat you need to start with.This video's sponsor is INDmoney.Which is a great app and I love it.I've personally used itfor a really long timebecause it's an appwhere my entire financial world exists.All my investments are also there,my liabilities and loans are also there,all my expenses get recorded there.If I want to make any investment,even that happens there.Whether it's investing in the US marketor investing in India's mutual fund.I have to track my equities,that too happens there.All of that is built in.Not just that,all this is done for free.Not just that,if some other product is comingor some other tools are coming,which they keep introducingevery now and then,like I'll get my credit reportalso from there,I will also be able to trackhow I can reduce my interest on loanbecause somewhere else,I'm getting loan at a good rate of return.All of this, is also built in.Not just mine, I can also track my family,So it makes it one place for not just mebut all otherincome-generating members in the family.This just makes it so simple.Don't have to apply brains.Don't have to track everything.There is only one worldand everything enclosed in that.And that is somethingthat I personally preferand I think is the first steptowards financial minimalism.So declutter your finances.I am an investor in INDmoney,so this is a biased opinion.And please use your expertiseand your homework to identifywhich is that appwhich can do this for you.My suggestion would be INDmoneybecause I personally use it.If you want to use it,then link availablein pinned comment on description.Number Two:Budgeting your money.There are so many people who have no ideawhere their money comes and where it goes.It is almost likeâ¦something is going on at freewill.Don't make that mistake.Give your money that respect,that you would giveto any other valuable thing.Budget it.Here is a good way of doing that.I have often talked about this.But never harms to repeat itself.50-30-20 rule.Whatever monthly expenses you incurred,whatever your monthly salary is,Assume, comes to â¹100.After tax, after provident fund,after all the deductions,out of that,you will spend maximum â¹50for your needs.Your wants.What are these?It is your rent,your water and electricity charges,your food expenses,any of your loan EMI.Any such thing that you surely need to doto live your life.This is not your personal loan EMI.Which you took for your desire,for some indulgence. No.This is something that you needto fulfill your livelihood.You have to spend that moneyto live life, â¹50.Then â¹30 will go to your needs.Don't have to become a hermit or a saint.Financial minimalism doesn't meanthat we forsake everything,exactly go to the Himalayasand settle down there. No.It also doesn't meanthat we spend so much for our old agethat when we have lost our teeth,we are munching corn. No.It meansthat we will live our life right now.Will of course live.And will plan for future too.So those â¹30 are for now.You have to buy your phone with it,buy good clothes,plan a vacation, buy a car.Any such thingthat is not essential for lifebut is your want, is your desire,Please manage it in those â¹30.Now when people hear this â¹30,they are like, how to manage in â¹30.For example,if your monthly income is â¹25,000.So, it comes to you after deduction.30% of that is â¹7,500.You want to buy a phone of â¹25,000.So, you'll say only â¹7,500 are left.In that, I shall also party,will also go out.So, from this 7,500I will be able to save maximum 5,000.So what you will do,is you will wait for 5 months.Save the â¹5,000 every monthto buy the â¹25,000 phone.Not a loan, phone.Don't take a loan, phone.You've got this â¹25,000 phonethrough your 30%.That is the budgeting way of doing it.Then you will invest the last â¹20towards the future.This will be for that timewhen you are not earning money.Or it will be for those goalswhich are big but are a bit outside.Be it children's educationor be it children's marriage.Or you may want to buy a big house,for its down payment.Your retirement,there is of course a plan for that.All of this will come from your 20.Now you will wonder,how will all this happen in â¹20.It will happen, as you are starting early.You are just in your 20s.These big expenses shall start comingat 35, 40 and beyond that.In the time period of that 10-15 yearsor more than that, 20-25 years,even this 20%will turn into very big money.Because you will spend it wiselyand that is something we will come to.Third, will keep yourself protected.Protected means,Never let any of your moneygo into things you can't predictAnd it may be such a big expensethat if God forbid, it does happen,everything will get erased by that.That is not the smart way of doing it.Financial minimalist alwaysmoves forward with a protective approach.They say, what are the expensesthat can wipe out my entire savings?Health, if anything happens to me.God forbid something happens to my family.If something happens to my parents,then the hospital expenses,will drain out everythingso they buy health insurance.Health insurance is not justwhat you get through the company,because whenever you leave that company,that health insurancewill go out of your handand you will have to take another one,not the smart way of doing it.Along with the company's health insurance,you will also buya personal insurance for yourself.A separate insurance for parents,and a separate insurance for your family.This is very important.Because parents are getting old.When they turn 60,their health insurance premiumwill be so high,that if you are associated with them,and at a young age you will be payingthe same premium as them,because health insurance,if you take a family plan,is decided by the premiumof the eldest member.Don't make that mistake.Parents apart, your family apart.That will be the health insurance.Second, what is that one thingthat will blow away all the savings?God forbid,something has happened to your life.You are the sole earning memberof the family,or one of the two earning membersand if God forbid,something happens to your life,or a critical illness strikes you,or you become incapable to workand to generate income,then how will future expenses be met?Life insurance for this.Life insurance is also the onethat will cover you for deathand all these events.Don't look at life insuranceas an investment.Because that will never give youthe kind of returns which you canautomatically generate outside.What you will do,is you will take a term plan.Term plan is that planwhere for a period,you take life insurance,like I took for 25 years, not 20 years,took life insurance for 20 years,at the age of 31 years.And I said that if I die before 51,my family will get â¹10 crore.For this I pay â¹1.75 lakh per year.If I don't die till 51, I will get nothingNow how does it make sense?It makes sense,because 10 crore is an amount that I know,will be enough for my family's entire lifeand for this, â¹1.75 a year,was the lowest premiumthat I could have got.If I had given this cover or policyof 10 crore as an investment,then my premium would not be 1.75 lakhwould have been much more than that.I didn't want to do that,because I am buyingonly and only life insurance.You can add many things to it.Be it critical illness,be it accident.By adding all these things, you can ensurethat whatever happens to your life,or whatever happensto your income earning potential,your family will remain protected.The sooner you can buy life insurance,the less premium you will have to pay.It is the smarter way to live life.My suggestion, at the age of 27-28,take life insurance cover till 30 or 35or up to retirement.Term plan at a very low premium,will give you maximum cover.And then the fourth steptowards financial minimalism.You regularly track your expenses.Particularly in today's world,there are a lot of subscriptions going on.Added for Netflix,added for Jio,added for Google Drive.Something else is going on here,have stopped using it,don't knowwhich one is going out from where,because somewhere,it has been done on UPA.Somewhere it has been done on credit card,somewhere it has been done on debit card.You will always at the end of the month,sit down and evaluatewhere your money goes.I kid you not, I run a 27-crore company.Every month, every penny, by debit card,credit card, or bank account,which are the only three modesof an expense.Every penny is accounted.Every single penny, on an excel sheet,I give account of every single expenseto my accountant.Where did it go, why did it go,and will it continue to go or not.With this clarity,I am able to discover so many things,which makes me think,why are we pursuing this?Why are we still spending money on this?We have bought some software,it is getting used,don't know how many people are using it,so I will question it.Somebody has bought some useless thingand then you will questionwhether this thingwas so important or not?Could it have been done differentlyor whatever the case is.The idea is that you will not makeyour expenses unreasonable.Because there is somethingcalled lifestyle inflation.How much is the inflation?6% right? Wrong answer.Your inflation is not 6%.Your inflation is 10-11%.Take it in writing.If you are watching this video on YouTube,on mobile phone,on 4G connection or on wi-fi,your inflationdoesn't get lesser than 10%. Why?Because what you experienceis what is the top category of India.You are not from a backward,poor village, you can bebut you have upgraded your life.You are earningor on the way to earning.You are studying in a good school.You can also do good job.All of this sets you in the top category.Meaning your expensesare going on a different inflation rate.And as your income increases,you will take more expenses.As the income increases,we are ready to take loans.We say, hey wow,now we can afford this EMI.Take a car, take something else.Buy a bungalow.Buy a home quickly.All of these are unreasonable expensesat the age and the income that you have.So don't increase your expensesregularly with your income.Evaluate and question every expensebecause that will make youa financial minimalist.Now I will share four such thingswith you from my lifewhere I deploy financial minimalism.We are bit of a weird family.We earn good money, very well.So much money,we may not know how to spend it.But we never spend needlessly.Our car is on rent.Our car is not ours.According to our income,we can buy a very big car.But we have taken a 10-lakh carand that too on rent.Pay â¹25,000 per month as rent for it.Because we don't want to own a car.We own a house,which we bought 3 years agothat is our only and only possession.We invest rest of the excess money,Most of it goes into mutual fundsor some of it goes into real estate,from where we keep getting yield.All for a bigger causewhich is a place for educationwhere I am focusing on,for the next 10 years.But the expenses are,1. Controlled.2. They are always reviewed.At the end of every month, as I have told.Number Two:As a family, we spend a loton experiences or knowledge.We know that the best use of our money,either teach us to earn more moneyor give us happiness in life.Something that we will appreciateand enjoy once all of this is over.We don't want to say while dying,maybe instead by running after moneywe had lived our life.We wish to saywhatever money we earned,was spent very well.Was spent very well.We never let money dominate us.So where do we spend?We spend a lot on travel.As a family, we love traveling.So, we do travel a lot.Live at good places.We go to good places.Eat at good places.That is something that we spenda lot of money on.We spend a lot of money on knowledge.We don't have any budget for books.Our children go to libraries.The libraries are expensive, so there.They go to a very good school, so there.We ourselves, me and Ruchi,take a lot of online courses.Or attend many sessions or events.So all of that.We play tennis.So we do spend enough on that.We focus on our fitness.So we do spend enough on that.So anything that is focused on experiencesand focused on knowledgeis where we spend our money.Rest every expense is almost eliminated.Number Three: Delayed gratification.If ever we have to buy anything,we ask ourselvescan we wait for 30 days?And when 30 days are over, we ask,do we still need this thing as muchas 30 days ago?Often the answer to the question is no.And that is true for almost everything.Almost everything.And that allows us to be gratifiedbut in a delayed manner.Because when you don't buy a thing,knowing that you don't need that,that is also a kind of gratification.It is not necessarythat only by buying thingsyou get gratification.So delayed gratification is somethingthat we genuinely deploy.Because from that,we get a sense of purpose.That our money, is not going into,useless things, useless status games,and useless gratification.It is something that is thought through.We really need it.And it is something that will helpour life become better.And finally,something that I am immensely proud of.Financial minimalismis in my view, also about giving.If you have that status, that stature,and that is a kind of passion,you don't want to useyour money just on you,but also want to use it for others,then give.And give not because you want to showthat you are giving.Give because you care about giving.So, we have a very simple cause,which is around education.Our entire business is built on education.And we only focus on businesses,which are those childrenwho can't fund their education themselves.Whether it is school or college,it is something that we help do that.100% as a business,which is our affiliate incomewhich are all the links that you click,and then you go and buy somethingor open Zerodha's Demat account and so on.All of that money goes towards fundingthe education of kidswho can't afford it themselves.In 2022,we spent â¹54 lakh for 123 childrenfor funding their schoolor college education.Something that gives me immense joyand something that we are very proud of.Because we know that with this education,their orbit can be changed.The situation in which they were born,the situation in which they grew up,they can get out of that.And that is ensured through educationwhich is something that we would loveour money to play a part with and in.Financial minimalism doesn't meanthat you will live with less in life.It means that in life,you will always live with intent.You always know where your money is going,why it is going, what is its needand what is its role in your life.And when you deploy that,less loans, more income,controlled expenses,investing your surplus towards a futurewhen you are not earning that income,while living life that makes you happy,you are a financial minimalist.A person who knows how to value his money,without chasing money,knows how to respect the money,and that will set you apartfrom everybody elsewho are just trying to playa status game with money,trying to show more money than they have.That is not true, because they maynot be happy from the inside,whereas you can be happy.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
