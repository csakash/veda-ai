In today's episode,I have Shradha Sharma with me,and everybody knows thatas an entrepreneur, the founder of'Your Story',I don't think there is any otherperson who has documentedand witnessed India's startup journeyso aptly as much as Shradha has.So thank you so much Shradhafor joining us today,it is a pleasure to have youon this conversation.Ankur, I am very excitedto be talking with youbecause you talked about me covering it,I had the privilege of seeing the journey,and we were just talking about the journeythat you have made,and it's always nice to talk to peoplewho have made in a journey,and thank you for this opportunity.Thank you again.So Shradha, I want to start withthe question that I often ask my guests.Go back to your childhood, and tell mehow was it growing up, especiallywhen it came to money?Did you grow up with a lot of money,without a lot of money,and how did that shape up yourearly relationship with money?Wow! This is an nteresting question.So Ankur, it's a very tough questionfor me because it's very similarto what a lot of people have had.I had an extremely schizophrenicrelationship with money.Just to give you a context,my father was in Merchant Navy.So I grew up in Patna,the heartland of patriarchy,Biharism, and everythingism.The Chief Minister at that timewas Lalu Prasad Yadav.It was a very different era,and at that time my father wasin Merchant Navy and he workedin an international company,so used to earn money,but at the same time,when he came back,the money used to just disappear,because he had a lifestyle.Like I give the example of my father,when he used to come, as a kid,I got exposed to Marlboro, 555,Benson and Hedges cigarettes,and then there was Charmis, a navy cut,so within 4-5 months, he reached there,so I mean, you never knew.The only thing is thatI had paranoia and a fearthat I don't want to be moneyless.Second is if you are growing upas a woman in Bihar,I've said it many times,we were four sisters,so whenever anybody used to come home,they used to say,'Sharma Ji, you have four daughters,you have to give so much dowry.'And I always used to think thatwhy should I be a liability?So my relationship with money wasabout self-reliance,I wanted to have my own money,I mean do not be dependent on anyone,do not have to listen to anyone, yeah.But at the same time money used to bea big thing, and sometimes I also dreamedthat I would find money in a tunneland all the problems in my house would besolved because I never knew why my parentsused to have so much of fightsbecause of money.So in a way did you grow up with angerthat you don't have money, or as you said,a fear that'My God, what would happenif there would be no money?'What was the overarching emotion?Fear, what if there is no money,and how important is it to haveyour own money?If you ask me Ankur, till today I feelthat I should not beg in front of anyonebecause one has to stoop a lot.And in a startup world to any world,I feel, your backbone remains intacteven if there is little moneybut there should be respect.You get what I am saying, right?So that is my relationship with money.Yes, self-respect is very important!One's self-respect should never go downbecause of money.No!So what did this fear made you do,Shraddha?It made me run a lot! I could not becomeMilkha Singh, but I ran a lot!I still remember that from PatnaI went to Delhi in an AC chair carwithout ticket, because I wanted to studyin St. Stephen's, because I thoughtthat those who study there are rich,they are successful, they become big,so I didn't know much in Bihar but I knewthat I had to do this.I still remember that my motherdidn't want me to do this because,'It's a co-ed, it will destroy you,stay in Bihar!'And I knew that if I stay in BiharI will be destroyed.So I just got on a train and went there,took admission, and gave an interview.I still remember landing in Delhiand doing things,and I think I've been on that runthat there should be no dependency,because Ankur, I have seen a lot of chaos,fight, and trauma that happensbecause of money,as in I wouldn't like to say someof the things but if it's not there...I want to be that rich personwho could say,Money doesn't matter.I want to reach that stage whereI have so much money that I could say,Money doesn't matter.As of now, it matters.How far are you from that stage?Ok, to be genuine, to be really honestwith you, I have realized that actuallymoney doesn't matter.Today I am at that stage, not becauseI have money, but because my mother hada tragic death, and I tried a lot,spent a lot of money so she livesbut she could not live,and 10-12 years back,that was the biggest realization to methat even after having money,nothing could be done,and I think that gave mea sense of abandon,because at that time,my life's journey was all about makingmy mother happy and proud of me,and she passed away, and no money,no nothing could save her.So now I don't think that money...I mean my spine should be intactbut money today doesn't actually matter.And now what is the drive?As they say, there is always some fearin a person which keeps them running,it was money for you in childhood,now it's not money,but what are you afraid of now?You know, I'm no longer afraid!Wow!Tell me more.Also because I did Vipassana,I used to be afraid of very small thingslike I flew my mother down fromPatna to Bombay in an air ambulance,and after that, I got flight phobia,I'm scared of turbulence.I'm super scared of death!Where do people go after death isa quintessential questionthat I keep on asking?Like my brother has schizophrenia,so I wonder what would go on in his mind,how will he live, and how will he surviveif I am not there.A lot of things,even for my father's health becausehe was not taking care of himself.Not anymore because somewhere Vipassanamade me realize the disintegrationof mind and body,not at a theoretical level,but I experienced it.It's not completely gone away,but I am not scared of death anymore.And I feel that one of the things is thatwhen a person goes througha lot of sorrows,I think some muscle gets developedin them, that you knowwhat's the worst that can happen,and now I am operating from what'sthe worst that can happen,and I think that is a liberating space.That is a liberating space.Shraddha, I have to tell you this,and I don't think I have ever admittedthis to you.Whenever I have spoken with you,and it's not much, maybe 4-5 times,I have always felt this vibe thatyou are carrying a lot of burden on you,and it's almost like you don't wantto pass that burden on to anybody else,and you are also acutely aware thatthat burden is there, and you have tosomehow process it and deal with it.So one, I'm just very glad that you wentto Vipassana, and I really hope thatthrough this you liberate yourselfin a way that you feel freer while peoplearound you will always adore you,respect you for what you areand what all you have done,but I think that love and just acceptancefor whatever you have gone through.No, but Ankur I am so impressed thatyou could catch that becauseI myself didn't know.If you had told me this even2 months back,'Oh, it feels like you are carryinga lot of burdens.'I would have said,'Oh, how are you making this judgmentfor me!I am so carefree, I am such a heroine,how could you say this?'But when I went there and spent 10 dayswith myself alone, I got to know thatI have a lot of compassion for myself.I even realized that I am only carryingthose burdens,nobody has given them to me.Just like the great Hanuman,I am carrying it,I don't know what and why,but now I have to let it go,and the ability to see your own selfin a very naked way.Yeah, that's so beautiful!The other thing that I always admireabout you,I don't think you know that as intenselyas you should, there are a lot of womenin India that draw couragefrom your story,because your story is a story thatdoes not come from privilege,does not seem to be luck or capability,there's hard work, intensity, commitment,and most importantly an unbelievablelevel of patience to just continuedoing whatever you are doing.Like I remember I don't know when it was,2007-2008, the first time when I saw you,I think there was some event at IIT Delhi,and you were hosting that event,and my first reaction was,'Who is she?'Like somebody who was conscious of beingon stage, yet wonderfully confident,and you held your ground there,and I am not surprised to see youwhere you are today, but you should knowthat your story inspires a lot of peoplein a way a that you possiblydon't fully understand.Do you feel that you have had it hardbecause you are a woman?First of all, thank you,I have to go on record that I think withtime the power of observation in people,we get so self-involved,but you have observed and I have to callthat out, that is one more trait about youthat I am sure people would know,but that's something I am calling outthat stands out.Has my journey been hard becauseI am a woman?Yes, of course!It's been hard because I am a woman yetat so many levels, growing up was hard,I know when we used to go to school,I never had a teenage life becausethere was always a fear of'Don't get picked up!''What if something happens?'That was a fear, and at that time,we didn't know what kind of environmentwere we living in,that you just had to do this and study.There have been a lot of judgmentsover the years,there have been a lot of...I always say, there is a song Ankur,if you will permit,I am not going to sing,I'll just tell you the line.It is from a movie calledDil Aashna Hai starring Divya Bharti.I was a kid when I heard itand this line stayed with me.Kisi ne Bhi To Na DekhaNigah Bhar Ke MujheGaya Aaj Ka Bhi Shaam Udaas Karke Mujhe.And always, sometimesbecause I am a woman,sometimes because I am a Bihari,sometimes because of Hindi,so there was discriminationat many levels and at many places.The only thing is that things startedchanging for me when I started embracing.Earlier, I used to cry,I was in the victim mindset.Now I think I stand tall,otherwise, what would happen,I think that mindset also takes time,it has taken time.And to everyone watching,I would say it takes time,there is no overnight successor strength or confidence formula,but I didn't get lot of entries in rooms,and people used to say,'Oh, she wouldn't know!'One of the things I always think isthat people always say Your Story,and I am like I am running itfor 14 years,I am profitable, I've never got creditedas a business person, out of a no-tam,with conviction,creating a profitable sustainable,employing people, creating good culture,having very smart people workingwho have stayed over the years,I have never got that pedestal,or that recognition.Shradha Sharma is a nice person,this person, I mean at how many levels,if I start I can tell you a full story,but now I have stopped questioning.Like my thing is that,What is my purpose?How can I live happily?Because if I start looking at hardness,then there is a lot, and that's whatI always tell womenwhenever I talk to them,because if you start looking at anythingand everything, then it is very hard,and then will that be my story?Or will I meet you as cooland confident and amazing?Be happy, and genuinely be happy,and not because I am meeting you,but be happy in every momentand when you are that,then you spread that,and I don't know, it gets manifested.I don't know if I am answeringyour question correctly.No, I get it.I understand and appreciatethe sentiment fully.What makes you most happy?What gives you the most joy?Genuinely if you ask me since childhoodand a psychiatrist told me recently,and it made sense is somewherewhen your voice doesn't get heard,you become empatheticto everyone else's voice.We either become a victim or very angryand critical or empathetic.I think I became empathetic.What gives me the most joy isactually genuinely being there for people.Like I always tell people,'I'm your 2 a.m in the night friend,if there is a crisis,I feel greatest pride if you can call me,'If there is a crisis in my life,I can call Shradha at 2 a.m.and she will stand with meor do something the best.'That gives me joy.Helping people as much as I can, yeah.And I so relate to that actually,I genuinely do, because help is something,where a lot of people have helped mewhen they had no reason to, and franklythey would never get anything out of it,and that just drives you to keeppaying it forward in some way thatif somebody helped me at some timewhich changed a lot,then what if with my help somebody's lifecan improve even a little bit,so it's just immense joy.Are there people in your life thatyou can reach out to for helpand know that they will always help?Oh, there are so many Ankur!That way I am very blessedand I don't know why not,and I think you'll agree over here,if you meet somebody somewherein an unfiltered manner,if you bring your whole self,then even the most sophisticatedand the most reticent peopleand the most critical people also lowertheir guard with you.It so happened with me,if I would think that in 14 years,neither did I become a unicornnor a soonicorn,I am just a babycorn or a popcorn,but what I have is,I am a lovecorn, I've got a lot of peopleloving and standing and helping.I can call people.People know that I won't screw them up.People can share things confidently,I can share things confidently,and to me, that's my biggest blessingin the journey I have made so far.Many!You do seem to be someone who would bethe confidant of a lot of people.I get a vibe that there area lot of people who would confide in you,trusting you fullythat you will protect their emotions,their sentiments,and respect their vulnerabilityat all points.Is that true?I take great pride in that.Ok, it's my ego kick!Yeah.And do these come naturally,or like if a friend is going througha tough time, then do you wait for themto reach out to you, or do you takethe initiative and check on them?You know Ankur, there was a moviecalled Sixth Sense starring Bruce Willis,there was a kid in that moviewho could see ghosts.I think I can sense people's pain.I have this great weapon!You know I was telling someone recentlythat if someone asks mewhat job can you do,what is your skill set?I would say my skill set is to seethe pain in people, and everyone carriessome or the other kind of pain.The only thing about having painin my life is I can see through,and hopefully, once you are ableto see through, like you were saying,you could observe me,so when you are able to see through,then it's easy to reach out, and it's easyto connect at a very primal levelwith human beings.Exactly!And there is no malice in that,there is no intent in just doing so,you are doing it out of justgenuine concern.Make sense!I want to talk about your day.What does your normal day look like?How would one observe Shradha if theywere to observe from a distance?Ok, so a typical day,when I am in Bangalore isI get up very early in the morningby 5-5:30, I meditate for 45 minutesto an hour every day.Before Vipassana, I used to dohalf an hour or 15-20 minutes,but now I do an hour a day.I spend time with my dogs,I have two Cocker Spaniels.Then I check my emails and all,what is the agenda for the day.Then I come to the office,and meet everyone.A lot of my time goes because thereis a lot of requests that comes,a lot of connecting, a lot of helping,I wish I got money for doing all that,but the whole day I do this,and then also, a lot of complaints comethat you didn't do to this,you didn't respond to that,a lot of anger comes from a lot of peoplebecause there are a lot of varied requestson WhatsApp and emails.Then I do my social engagements,like if somewhere someone wants me to doa session or something like that,that takes time.My typical day ends,I don't know when it ends,but around 9-10 or whatever,there's no that thing,but I sleep peacefully Ankur.To be very honest with you,I get good sleep, it's less in time,but yeah, I sleep well.And what is the most undesirable partof your day?If you ask me today, I'll be very honest,anything that has repeatability to it,now I have got bored of it.Like earlier, for me,people used to make fun of Your Storythat it won't work,so I had to make it work,build a team, make it profitable,and do good stories.And now if you ask me runningthe day-to-day operationsdoesn't excite me.It should work on autopilot.I feel I am an impediment to my company.So anything which becomes repeatable,which you have done, I like to doand conquer new things.Your Story is the only thing I have donefor 14 years, but they said,even Ram came back from his exileafter 14 years, so maybe this is my exile.I hope I get some very smart leaderswho now take this forwardfrom my team and outside, so yeah,that's what I'm looking forward to.And you still have a long lovely lifeahead of you, how do you visualize that?Like are you a planner, do you liketo plan your future, you should havea plan or a goal or a target in life,or are you more of a fluid personwho goes with the flow?Ankur, nothing in my life happenedas per plan.I never planned anything,because nothing worked out as planned.Like my life is,and that's what I tell,that if I could survive or thriveor be happy, the only thing I am wanting,the only plan and the commitmentI have made for myself,which I'm enjoying for the past few years,I want to go on my inner journey.I find those people very attractivewho don't remain static as human beings.Do you get what I am saying?Because communicating,presenting yourself superficially,and flourishing in your inner journey,so the only plan that I have for myselfis to spend a lot more time figuring outand decoding the internal me,because I just think that is somethingI would like to spend my time on more,but other than that there is no plan,I want to live in the moment.I want to be a person who if dies tonight,then there is no checklist of100 undone things, otherwise,my ghost will haunt,I would be roaming around thatthis is not done!But no, I want to live in the momentthat if tonight I pass away,I was good to people, I did my best,I was honest, I was kind, and I enjoyed.What does that mean,enjoying every moment?If theoretically, you have to say,how do you do that?Can you imagine yourself becominga monk one day or are you too attachedto the real physical world?I would love to be a monk one day, yeah.I would love to be a monk,and I would love to embrace human beings,because I just think thatthere is so much pain,and we are entangled in the loopof our pain only.So until you solve your own pain,how will you solve others?So, yes.And yeah, I do contemplate thatI would love to go a lot within.Wonderful!I have a very strong feelingthat's going to happen.I don't know, let's make a predictiontoday on the 20th of September 2022,I have a very strong feeling thatyou are going to change people's livesin a way that you haven't yet imaginedfor yourself and of course,in a wonderful way,not that you haven't done it so far.Here, I want to call you out that whileI do that, I hope I do that,I want to say that your book,I am meeting so many people,has changed and inspired so many people,and I want to call out thatwhat you are doing is so inspiringand so wonderful, that you genuinely meetpeople here and there on the airport,and you see that the book you wrotehas made such a difference.Thank you, I frankly had no idea,and I think the credit goes to Chikkifor even getting me to write one,and now saying,'Now keep writing till you can.'So it's been a wonderful journey!Very very gratifying!I want to switch gears to work.I wasn't kidding when I said thatI don't think that there would bemany people in this country who havetracked and felt the whole startup journeyso vividly.You've been a part of it in conversations,I am sure so many people confided in youin moments that they couldn't confidewith anyone else.What do you think has changed the mostin the attitude of entrepreneurs/foundersin this country in the last 10 years?Ankur, maybe I am givinga very simplistic answer,there is a different level of confidence.And I am not saying, at every levellike I meet a lot of people,and everyone would be confidentin some way or the other, but there isa very different unapologetic sense ofwho I am and what I am doing.That's a very marked difference I seein the last 12 years that I've beentracking this space.And the second thing is that like earlier,we used to have a verymiddle-class mentalityto entrepreneurship and all that, still,it's not like they are super rich,they are now also middle-class,but if I've to give a mentality framework,that middle-class mentality hasa rich class attitude that,'I can do it, don't screw with me!'You know, would know that there wasan era when entrepreneurs were giving 60%in Angel rounds,50-60% in Angel round fundingfor a few lakhs,and so many things used to happen.I think it's become a lot simpler,entrepreneurs are far more aware,so that change is very conspicuous.Yeah, I would certainly agree with you.And given that you also havea lot of exposure inthe international markets, you are calledupon to represent the country,to represent the ecosystem,what continues to be,'I wish Indian founders had this thingthat you often see outside?'I see it in the US, I wouldn't say thatmuch for Europe or southeast Asia,but I always get very impressedby the selling ability, articulation,and storytelling ability of entrepreneursin the US,especially what I see in the bay area,it still stuns me.It's like meeting consulting guys, right?Like I am always impressed meetingall these top consulting firmsthey are so articulate, they are so sauve,and I feel that in Indian entrepreneurs,I still meet and I still feel thatthey should sell their stories properly,do a little better, and that I see asa very conspicuous difference still.Makes sense.I would agree with that as well.I think for some reason in India,it's not in our DNA to create a brandand an association.We always crave external brands,and external associations,but we very rarely create themfor our own self.That is also the reason why there werenot many personal brands in India,not many homegrown brands.There's one Tata, so we will buyTata salt, Tata car, Tata School,Tata airline, you just keep riding on itand we will keep trusting you.So this thing is not ingrainedin the way that we think.The US is just always thinking brands,associations, and stories.How can I create this one thingand make it into something far bigger?Yeah, I so agree.And then on the flip side,when you look at Indian founders,is there something that you see herevery clearly that you do not seein other countries,something that sets us apart?I would be a little biased towardsIndian founders in Indian entrepreneursbecause I come from here.I think the struggle.The struggle that we have to go throughin India as an Indian founder.The sociological construct aroundwhich we have to perform,not just the economic,not just the market,not just the capital, all that is there,but it's like being in a playground,when an Indian founder entersthe playground,they have to remove the hurdles,clean up the area, and then play.There in an international playground,the surface is very smooth,and that to me is something thatI would say makes an Indian entrepreneurmore endearing, more perseverant for me.Yeah, wonderful.When you described this I was remindedof my school, where there were at least50 kids running behind one football,and there was no concept thatthere is a goalkeeper,someone is a forward,no, everyone played the same role.Everyone was running after the same ball,and it was in the same place,in the same dust, in the same dirt,with the same bricks,everything had to be done.Ok, finally, closing up.How do you take care of your money today?Is there is somebody who managesyour money or do you manage it yourself?No, I have a few people,few people in the sense that peoplewho advise me and there is someonewho manages money for me.Right now, I don't have that kind ofmoney, Ankur.I will answer this question properlynext year.Because I want to tell this,and again maybe through your platformI want to say this, and I don't knowif it's a good thing or a bad thing,but you could believe in a journeyfor so many years like me,and be an entrepreneur without capital,because after all this,I hope there will be a substantiveand a good outcomehopefully to Your Story,and that's how I will create wealthand I will have money,because I don't have that kind of moneybut yeah, that is my answer.All the best with that!I so relate to what you are saying.I often say to people that one ofthe worst reasons to becomean entrepreneur is thatyou will make money,because the probability of making moneythrough this route isfar far far far lowerthan if you want to just stick in a joband climb up the corporate ladder.But it's like, news or media workson survivorship bias,so there's of course, always this thing,'Oh wow! Funding, that person becamea millionaire or a billionaire,they got esops,this and that, bungalow, car, fame!'So we just believe that that'sthe entire world which is not,it's a very very small part of it.What would you like to spend your moneyon once you have a lot of it?A lot of things.If you ask me, a very selfish interestthat I have is,I have a lot of selfish interests,but if I would do something personallyfor myself, then I would buy farmlandwhere I would really loveto live in nature.The second is my brother is staying ina schizophrenia rehab here in Bangalore,they live hand to mouth, so I would want,and I see the girls there, one is havinga mental disorder, and secondly if a girlhas it then people just leave themon the streets, and just becauseI have seen the pain so closely,I would like to create, India still lacks,I would like to contribute and careand create for mental health becauseit is available for rich peopleat a certain level,but for the poor and middle class,how do we raise?And I have lend my voice to that also.The third is my mother got burntand passed away.I think India doesn't havegood burn wards,and I am going on record to say that,so I would like to contribute to that.And fourth is if I have lived like a womanand stood tall,then I can bullshit anything,if I can do a little bit to create,and I don't even need money becauseI am thinking of doing it sometime nowis a lot more opportunities, capital,scholarship for girls, especially comingfrom very difficult backgrounds.So, there's a lot that I want to do.So, all this is there in my mind,and I want to hopefully make this happenin the next couple of years.Fantastic!It will definitely happen, 100%!It's wonderful that with all the moneyyou bought just one farmland for yourself,and gave all the rest to people.But Ankur that farmland could bein Hawaii as well!Oh, then the cost of commuting willalso increase.No, move out there only!Awesome!Are you a mountain personor a beach person?I am split.What are you, you tell me?I am a mountain person, hands downa mountain person.Yeah, I don't know, I am split,I like Goa also, I like Manali also,I like Gulmarg also,yeah, so it's difficult.No, it is! I get that!Do you get time to travel?Do you go on vacations,like proper vacations,shut off and travel?I did.Vipassana was a test for me to do that.Last few years, of course,one couldn't travel,but I do travel,because governments of other countriescall me so I do travel,and because I want to representcool India,so I do that.But I am looking forward in the next yearto travel more, and make it a partof my agenda.Perfect, awesome, wonderful!One last question, what would you pickbetween speed and perfection?Always always speed.Love it!Thus spoke the entrepreneur!No matter if it's a broken car,it should at least work.It will keep working till the timeit has life, that's the biggest thing,but it won't stop the journey to achieveperfection, never left home only.That's so true!Wonderful!Thank you so much Shradha!I have to repeat this becauseI genuinely feel it.Your work is commendable,you are making a big difference,thank you for leading,and thank you for taking charge.You serve as an inspiration toa lot of people so please don't ever ever,like if you ever have any self-doubtin any moment about what you've doneand you couldn't bring about a change,then all you need to do is just go backto everybody who follows you not becauseof just Your Story, but genuinelyyour own story,and how you have navigated that,so thank you so much for everything.Ankur, before we shut, I want to saythank you for saying this.I will do a disservice if I don't callthis out that you are a very generousand good man, and we in our countryneed more men like you.I want to say this because when we saythat there are biases and everything,thank you for giving me this opportunity,and thank you for being generous and kind,because if we have more peoplethen we will have more women sharingtheir stories, thank you.Absolutely! I would love to do that!Thank you so much!Thank you for calling that outand acknowledging it!Pleasure! All the best with everything!See you next year at yourisland/farmhouse wherever it would be!I am sure it is going to happensooner than later.All sweet things for you!Totally!Thank you Shradha, all the best!Ok, thanks Ankur, bye-bye, thank you!
