a huge hit,and I had a great desire to do this videothis year also.Last year and this year,I discussed 10 gifting ideasthat you can gift to your familythis festive season,be it Diwali, Christmas, New Year's,or just generally,you wanted to gift something.If you want to gift to your parents,or siblings, not yourself,because we keep doing that,but you want to gift those people,then in this video, 10 such gifting ideasthat you all shared with me.So in this video, 10 such gifting ideasthat you can gift to your family,and you have only shared all these ideaswith me.I would like to give all these giftsto your family as well.How?3 Steps.Number 1:You will have to subscribe to this channelbecause this is applicable only tothe followers.Number 2:There is a link to a formin the pinned comment and description.Click on that formand fill in your details,it has a very important question as well,How many times do I use the word'giveaways' in this video?If you answer this question correctly,then only you will be eligible,but you will have to watch the whole videoproperly to answer this question.And the number 3 which is most exciting:For every hundred thousand views,I will give each of these gifts.So these 10 gifts,one quantity of each gift forthe first 1 lakh views,means a total of 10.As soon as 1 lakh views are crossed,then I will increase these from 10 to 20and I will give one gift twice.As soon as it crosses 3 lakh views,I will give these gifts thrice.And if all of you guys share this videowith your friends, and take it toone million views, then a bumper pricewill open on that one million views...And because of all this, a bumper prize!If we reach 1 million views by sharingthis video, then a bumper gifting ideawill be unlocked,which I will tell you guys at the end.Let's get started.Number 1:This beautiful copper bottlewith two glasses.It seems like I am talking for HomeShop18!Look at this beautiful copper bottlewith two attractive glasses!They look pretty good!These are really nice!Copper is meant to be a really good metalfor drinking water, so if you wantto give it to your parents,then this can be a great gift.Looks beautiful, will be healthy too,and I am sure they will bevery proud of you.It's on Amazon for â¹1,700.You can ignore GST because usually,GST applies to a company,it is a business account.So this gift of â¹1,700 is great to giveto your parents for Diwalior to give something like thisto someone whom you genuinelyconsider close to you, and this isthe first gifting idea for this season.Number 2:My dad is somehow very fond ofgold watches,and I'm sure your dad will too.So a very beautiful gold-plated watchfrom Titan which also has a date dial.This is a lovely wonderful forever gift,if you want to want to gift it to anybody.Of course, it's a gift meant for oldieslike fathers,new age generation wears smartwatches,but they are happy to see the dateson an actual watch.This is for â¹1,596 or â¹1,600on Amazon itselfbut if you are gifting it to your fatherthen you must give it toyour mother as well.So the third gifting idea isfor mummy papa,no sorry, for mummy,and it is a Titan's watch which is againsomething recommended by all of you.It is also for â¹1,600 on Amazon itself,and this will then complete the giftfor mummy and papa.Unfortunately, you can choose onlyone of these,so when you will fill out your form,please don't fill in both,because then instantly,you will not be eligible.You will have to subscribe to the channel,choose one gift,and tell us how many times I say the word'giveaway' in this video,and if you answer correctly,then only you will be eligible,and then of course, share this videoas much as you can because,at every 1 lakh views,these gifts will keep doubling.Next, at the fourth number,the Rosemoore Reed Diffuser.I don't know if you have seen it,but I really like it.Basically, you put these bamboo sticksin this perfume bottle,and slowly this fragrance spreadsin the whole room.It is great for bathrooms, washrooms,great for drawing rooms,you can keep it in the kitchen as well,wherever, and there is a subtle smellall the time.It lasts quite a long.When I use it,it lasts for around 45-60 days.And this is for â¹1,700.Usually, they are quite expensivebecause this diffusing oil is quiteorganic and expensive,and this brand Rosemoore is a reallygood brand for particularly this product.So this is gift number 4 for your familyfor this festive season.Number 5:Our parents are addicted to mobile phones,and they have been watchingTV all their life,so their eyes hurt,dark circles start to form,and fatigue comes.So for that this wonderful eye patch.This eye patch through Sand Puppy isa relaxing cool gel eye mask.If you use this, it's almost likecucumbers used to cool our eyesand improve dark circlesas in to remove them,it does the same thing but now of course,scientifically done through a product.So it can be used as a sleeping maskwithout the gel.So it's really good if they wanta sleeping mask.Even if they don't want it,if they want to just relax their eyes,then this is a great product.It is only for â¹750, and I am surethat your parents would love it.Gift number 6:Our parents have gotten used to livingin pain.Whenever they have pain, they say,'No, it's ok, we will manage.'But why?So if they want to get rid of this pain,and they want a heating pad mostlyfor their back, shoulders, and knees,then the same brand Sandpuppy has come upwith a heat wrap.It is brilliant because it compressesyour body part very well whereverthere is pain. So if you want to applythe hot treatment anywhere,then this is a great way to do it.Recently while playing tennis,my left shoulder started hurting a lot,to the extent that I had to gofor physiotherapy,but during that whole process,the doctor always said that you haveto do physiotherapy, but after going home,you should also take at least 15 minutesof hot treatment, and for that, I use thisSand Puppy Heat Wrap, and it was brilliantbecause I could just lie down,and I could keep that heat wrapon my shoulder,and it really helped me in my pain.I am certain that this is a productwhich your parents will really like a lot.They will never buy it for themselvesin their life, so it's bestthat you gift it to them.Only for â¹1,214 on Amazon,and I am more than happy to gift itto your parents for absolutely free.Gift number 7:Vacuum cleaner for your parents' carbecause why is their car so dirtyand why don't they clean itor get it cleaned by a cleaner?!They won't hire one,so why don't we just help them?A vacuum cleaner that can connect tothe charging point in the car itself,so you don't need any electricaloutput or input for thatand it is reasonable enoughthat it can clean up all the dirton the floor mats, and on the seats.All the parts there which are usuallythere in a vacuum cleaner.And it comes with a 1-year warranty.It's by GoMechanic, a well-known brandfor these purposes,and for only â¹1231 on Amazon.Gift number 8:Memory foam pillow.I don't know if you have ever usedbut my life has improved a lot afterusing a memory foam pillow in termsof sleep quality.Memory foam pillows take the shapeof your head and neck while sleeping,and when you wake up,it goes back to normal.Just like the cotton pillows whichwe used in childhood, at least I did,as you laid your head on it, it went down,so there came a point when that pillowtook the shape of your head and neck.You don't want that because thenthe main requirement of the pillowis destroyed.Memory foam pillows come backto their original form.A pack of 2 by the company White Willowwhich makes amazing memory foam products,that is available only for â¹1,899,but absolutely free from my sidefor your
