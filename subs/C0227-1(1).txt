Check 1 2What is net worth?What is my net worth?Why is net worth importantand how can it be increased?We will get to know in this video,includes an Excel sheetFriends, in this video we will play with Excel,it would be good fun!So basically, I talk about net worth many times,and I recognize that I keep showingyou my Smallcase app, my INDmoney app,or any other investment apps that I use,in this video, I actually wanted to transparently,absolutely transparently, show youwhat is actually my net worth,which means what is my value in terms of money,and why is that important,and how can you calculate it for your own self,and how can you grow that value,because it is a very important distinction.So, what is the definition of net worth?Let's start with that.It is a very simple definition.The definition of net worth is,the difference between all yourliquid investments or your illiquid investments,which means yourNo, this one againSo, first we will start with what is thedefinition of net worth?It is a very simple definition.Net worth is the difference betweenall your investments and all your liabilities.Now all the CAs would be like,âWhat is this video?We learnt it so many years back.Tell something new!âBut there are enough people who are not CAs,so even investments and liabilities,they also have a very simple definition.Investment means each and every thingwhere you have deployed your money,which is either growing or not growing,and weâll walk through each one of them,so it could be your equities, stocks, gold,your PPF, real estate, you have it at home,you have done an FD,all of those are your investments.What are your liabilities?All the things that you owe to someone else,which is mostly banks or for that mattereven individuals, if you have borrowedmoney from them.So, all your loans are your liabilities.It could be home loan, education loan,car loan, business loan, credit card,all of those things are your loanswhich you owe to someone.Plus, all your guaranteed liabilitiesin terms of an outflow.So, if you have to make an insurance payment,come what may, you have to do it.If you have to give some other EMIfor whatever youâve bought,come what may, you have to pay that.All of those are your liabilities.The difference in these is your net worth.Now, net worth could be positive or negative.For example, if you have â¹100and you deposited those â¹100 in bank,but you have taken a loan onwhich you have to repay â¹120,then what is your net worth?100 minus 120, which is negative 20Which means, God forbid if something happensto you today then you will have toowe the world â¹20 that have to be paid off.In the opposite direction if you have â¹100and you have to take a loan onwhich you have to return only â¹50,then your network is now 100 minus 50,which is actually 50, which means God forbid,if something happens to you today,then you will not have any financial liability,you will still have net net â¹50whether for your family or yourselfor whatever the case may be.So in this video through Excel sheetI will try to explain to you, not try, I will tell you,that how will my net worth be calculated.How can you then calculate your net worth?Why calculating this net worth is so important?And how can you finally increase your net worth?Let's start with the Excel sheet!Ok let's startAlright, so I have created a structure ofa very simple Excel sheetand then I will quickly start tellingyou what the numbers are.So what are the investments?Now in investments, all your assets,and these are the assets,it could be your mutual fund,if you have invested in US stocksor any international market,it could be your Indian stocks,it could be your PMS which is calleda Portfolio Management Service,let's not complicate it, but basically,if you have invested anywhere else,where somebody else is managingyour money, which is something that I have,and that's why I have put it in there.It would be your Crypto investment,it could be your money in the bank, real estate,FD,EPF, PPF, NPS, bonds, gold, and it could becash as well but I am treatingbank and cash as the same thing.Then comes your liabilities.It could be a home loan, education loan,car loan, personal loan, business loan, credit card,it could be some other loan as welland you can add that too.Basically, this sheet is very flexible.So let's start with the first thing.The first thing that you do is,approximate the growth rate of allthese asset classes. Now, these are whatyou expect to be a long-term growth rate.For example, I think I will get 12% growthon an average every year in mutual funds,stocks, Indian stocks, PMS. I have taken itat 15% for Crypto.For my savings account in the bank, it is about 3%,it is not even that much these daysbut whatever it is.In real estate, I feel over a long period of timeit will give an appreciation of 7%.In FD, you get about 5%In EPF PPF and NPS, it is about 9%In bonds, about 7%And in gold, about 10%Which is what you would expectas a growth rate.When you come to liabilities,then home loan, we usually take it for 20 years,if you take it for 25 years then,I mean every year this loan reduces by 5%approximately it is not the exact number.If you take an education loan for 10 years,then it reduces by 10% every year.A car loan is usually for 5 yearsso it reduces by 20%A personal loan is usually for 3 yearsso it reduces by 30%A business loan could be for 20 yearsso it reduces by 5%And for a credit card you have to repaywhatever you have spent come what may,this is something that I have spokenabout actively.Now, you have to enter all your numbersAnd now, I am going to put my own numbersso that it is clear that how does it work.All these numbers, they may shock you,they may wow you. That is not the intentionof sharing these numbers.Please don't be after my life saying,'Oh, you have got so less or so much money'.None of that is material.This Excel sheet is available for a downloadYou can enter your own numbersin this Excel sheetI will clear out the sheetand then only upload itand give it to you for download.So separate column, which is the value,which means what is the value as of today,and then this is a number whichyou can change, so I will make this green,this is green, right?Yes, green, okThis is the number of years,so you have to see that all your investments,after this period which I have assumedit to be 10 years,what will be their valueand then after inflation-adjusted,what will be their valuebecause inflation is somethingwhich deteriorates money,so I have assumed inflation to be 6%and because of this the value of your moneywill reduce even though theactual amount after 10 yearsmay seem like a really big amount.For example, in my mutual fund as of today,I have â¹11.9 lakhs, I am doing this in lakhs,so after 10 years at 12% these 11.9 will be 37 lakhs,but after inflation-adjusted, in today's date,it will be equal to 20.64 lakhs, which meansmy 12 lakhs will be around 20.64 lakhsafter 10 years in terms of today's value of money,not 37.I will have 37 in my bank at that time,but its value would be 20.64.In US Stocks I have invested 19.5,then in Indian stocks, it is 21.2,then comes PMS in which I have invested 22.5,this is the money which other peopleare managing for me,I've invested about 10 lakhs in Crypto,in my bank I have â¹18000, this is theactual amount that I have in my bank right now,in real estate I have invested in two housesworth 3 crores and 60 lakhs, I mean not two houses,one house and one land, detail is not important.I don't have any FDI don't have any EPFI don't have any PPFI don't have any NPSI don't have any bondAnd we have gold for about 10 lakhsThat is how this entire thing isSo, now you will see that if I were to showyou the numbers, after 10 years at this growth,if I do not touch it, do not withdraw it,do nothing with it, just let it be,then according to this approximation,the Asset Value that I have today of â¹4.5 crores,will be about 10 crores, but afterinflation-adjusted, its value wouldonly be 5.62 croresThis is my asset side which meansmy investing sideNow let's come to the liabilitiesI have aLet me just freeze, okNow let's come to home loanSo I have a home loan of 1 crore 80 lakhsI do not have any education loanNo car loanNo personal loanNo business loanOn my credit card, I have â¹2 lakhs,but as I said we will keep paying that offso that will continue.So after 10 years, this loan of 1 crore 80 lakhswill reduce to about 1 crore,in the inflation-adjusted world its valuewould be around â¹60 lakhsNow what you will see, and this is my net worthNet worth is simply the differencebetween the two sides,so we will highlight thisand this will be the interesting piece, okNow we will see how does it changewhich is why it is important for you to knowthe net worth and to figure it out.First of all, God forbid if something happensto me today, I would not want thatmy family would be bound to leave this house.Right now, my net worth is positiveby 2 crores 70 lakh rupees, wow!This means if I die then my family wouldhave 2 crores 70 lakh rupees.I have insurance but that is separateand outside of this conversation,we will not get into that, so we have2 crores 70 lakh rupees, but in this,the house is worth 3 crores 60 lakh rupees.If I remove this, then my net worth isactually negative 90, which means,God forbid if something happens to me todayand I would not want that the house inwhich my family is today, they shouldhave to leave it, then they will be sittingon liability of minus 90 lakhsâ¹90 lakhs!And if I don't have insurance,then this is the best reasonwhy you should be convinced aboutinsurance, because if somethinghappens to you, then your liabilities will,unfortunately, be greater than your investments,and that is not good for your family.Liabilities must be covered which isreason number one why you shouldhave insurance.The second thing is, ok, this is sorted,after 10 years my net worth will be 1.67,I have removed the home portionand my liability will only be 60,ok great, then I will be positive.So, I will actually see at what number,if I make it 4, after 4 years my net worthwill be around â¹3 lakhs, which meansI cannot die before 4 years.I will have to maintain this investmentfor a period of 4 years for my familyto be completely protected.This is why your net worth calculationis so important. It may not be as importantfor you because you are so early in the game,you are only in 20s, you have just started earning,you donât have any assets or any liabilities,so net worth is as it is. But to do thatfor your family, to do that for your parents,to do that for the entire unit,which is by the way the family, is important.Because this is the financial responsibilityyou should have towards your nearestand dearest ones. Like, this is thefinancial prudence that I talk about,make videos about.It is important that you sit down and do thisentire exercise with your family.Now, from where did I get these numbersand how can you use this net worth.4 years may seem like a long time,but it may seem like a really short time,it depends on you, it depends on theassets that you have.Suddenly if I bring back that 3.60,the life seems so beautiful,everything is alright, so on and so forth.Now there are 2 ways of increasingyour net worth.Number 1, increase your investmentsNumber 2, decrease your liabilitiesThis is simple maths.How do you increase your investments?Number 1, keep increasing all theseamounts, which is why SIPs are so important,I have made a complete video on SIPwhich you should watch. Putting inthe SIPs whether it is mutual fundsor anything else, is a great practiceand please invest your SIPs indirect mutual funds, not in a commissionor a growth mutual fund,because you have to pay a higherexpense ratio in that.Watch the video of what I mean,because that will give you lot more clarity.So, you are increasing all the asset value,this is a very important thing.2nd, you are improving their growth ratestoo at a collective level, so if you see now,these are the growth rates, and if I,letâs say for example, I make it this,this divided by the actual amountto the power one by four minus 1,and I will do percent, ok.So, this will tell you that the actual returnthat I am getting is 8.1%.8.1%So, all my investments give me anactual return of only 8%, inflation is 6%,which means my investments are growingby only 2% every year.And why is that?Because a bulk of investment is inreal estate which is growing at only 7%,now if I remove that, now see the difference,it is growing at 12%, right?These are the decisions thatyou have to make.Which is that at what growth rateare you growing your investments.If you are young, you should put it inmutual funds, in US stocks, in Indian stocks,in crypto as well, but not a lot,not more than 5%-10% of the total,donât put it in FD, donât put it in EPF,donât buy a house right away and real estate,donât put it in the bank, donât put it in bonds,you can buy a bit of gold because it is still 10%,but these are the important thingsthat you need to bear in mind to keepgrowing your investments, which is number 1.Number 2, you have to decrease your liability.How to decrease your liability?By being smart about it.Buying the mutual funds directly,not growth, as it will save your expense ratio,by saving on tax, so investing inall kinds of tax linked savings,that can allow you to saveas much tax as possible.Making sure if you can move all your loansto give a lower interest, then figuring that out.Now all these things are a lot to take care of, yeahFirst, you have to track all these thingsI have made this Excel sheet because I like itYou also may like itthen you won't do it, 'I will not do it,I don't want to see sugarcane farms!',I don't know if you got the reference or not.It was an amazing movie!Never mindIf you have guessed the moviethen write it in the comments section right nowwhich movie was it,'I don't want to see sugarcane farms!What is there in sugarcane farms?'Just for fun, nothing else!Anyway, so this is a lotThen you also have to track,that you have to reduce the liabilities.Which loan needs to be transferred where?Which mutual fund needs to be changedfrom regular to direct? so on and so forthSo, all of this is a lot to take care of, right?This is why I have repeatedly spokenabout it and I love INDmoney as an applike it is truly a super money app.All of these numbers, which I haveby the way here, all are from INDmoney.All of these things are linked,my mutual funds, my US stocks,my Indian stocks, my credit cards,my PMS, my real estate, everything is there,the only thing it doesn't track is Cryptobut I think it's a matter of time,sooner than later.And then all my liabilities, all my loans.So it gives me alertsAnkur, the mutual fund you have takenif you change it to a direct plan,you will save this much money.This is the right time to do it,which is brilliant advice.Your home loan of 1 crore 80 lakhs,if you move it from this bank to this bank,and it's just a one-click purchase on our app,then you will save this much EMI,which is a brilliant thing for me to know of.These are all the tax-saving schemes,you can buy out of these and save tax,which is a great thing for me to know.These are the investment opportunities,you want to buy stocks, you want toinvest in the US, you want to buy ELSS,you want to buy bonds, you want totrack your PPF, you want to track your NPS,all of this is part of the INDmoney app,which is why I keep saying that youmust have an app that just allowsyou to track everything in one goand make it super super super simplefor you to know all the detailsthat you need to know.The objective of this video wasto introduce the concept of net worth,number 1By showing my net worth, I wanted toshow you how the net worth changes,if I do not have a house then my liabilityis 90 lakhs, if I do have a house andif something happens to me thenthe house would have to be sold,which is why insurance is so important,it is so so so goddamn important.Don't take it lightly!Number 2, keep growing your investments,allocate them in the right class.So much of mine is stuck in real estate,I wish, well not I wish,I bought the house because I had toat 40 years of age,but if you are 24-25 years oldthen please do not buy a house,it is a waste of resources right now.You should do it when you areslightly older, settled, you knowyou need this big a house,you know you have to live in this city,so on and so forth.By the way, I also made a video on'Renting and buying a house',which you should watch.It is a very well-received video,it will help you also hopefully.That also has an excel sheet thatyou can use to evaluate theentire buying and renting decision.Long story shortHow to increase your investmentsand decrease your liabilities,all of that could be managed through an app,which at least personally for me is INDmoney,because I love the fact thateverything can be tracked.It has a lot of advisory functionswhich keeps telling me every daythat you can save money hereor make money there, and all of that,which is just very powerful.And the best thing, it is a family app.Not just mine, but my wholefamily can be tracked.I haven't shown you that becauseit involves the whole family,Mom, Dad, Ruchi, and all of them.But if you were to do this exercisefor yourself and I strongly encourageyou to do it please, do it through an app,not necessarily to an excel sheet.It is slightly complicated.You can make it automated.Simplify your lifeand be smart about your money.May your net worth keeps increasing,it may never stop,with this wish and prayerAnkur Warikoo, signing off!
