First of all, let's try to understandwhat is an inflation-proof portfolio.Basically, inflation is a rate by whichthe cost of things increases every year.If inflation is 6%, then somethingwhich costs you â¹100 todaywill cost â¹106 next year.So wherever you invest your money,your main objective should be to beatthis rate of inflation.Why?Because if your money is not growingat this rate,then your money is getting rusted.Let me give you a simple example.Suppose you invest your moneyin a fixed deposit,and you are very happy to get 5%,because without any risk your moneygrows by 5% every year.So you invest â¹100,next year it will be â¹105,then in the next year,it will be â¹111, so on and so forth.But we forget that â¹100which can be used to buy somethingworth â¹100 today,will not be able to buy somethingworth â¹100 in the future,because that thing will be worth â¹106 now.So your money grew from â¹100 to â¹105,but that thing that you wanted to buyis now worth â¹106.This means your money reducedby 1% in a year.Its value is reduced by 1%.And this is the biggest thingabout inflation, it corrodes your money.So wherever you invest your money,you have to make more than the inflation.5 ways that you can deploy in 2023to make your money inflation-proof.First of all, let's seethe actual numbers of inflation.So I have written the average inflationannually from 2012 to 2022 here.So in 2012, the inflationwas around 9.3% annually,then it was 11%, then 6%,then 5, blah blah blah.So this means on an averagethe inflation in the last 10 yearsis 5.9% or 6%.In other words, the cost of thingshas increased by 6% every year.Now this is an average.There could be many thingsthat might have grown less than thisor more than this,but on an average you can consider itto be 6%.Now, what are the ways to beat this?The first way is gold.People say that buying gold isa good hedge for beating inflation,but data doesn't suggest this.If you observe the changein the gold rate annuallyfrom 2012 to 2022,you will realize that on an averagethe price of gold has increasedby 6.5% only yearly,which is barely crossing inflation.So if you have invested in goldin the last 10 years,whether in the form of digital goldor worst jewelry,then your money is barely able tobeat the inflation of 5.9%.Rather after taxes,even that will not happen,because this year even at 6.5%,you will have to pay at least 20-30% tax,and that means that your moneyin the form of gold could notbeat the inflation,but this is still somethingthat people continue to do.My belief is that you will haveto mix gold with some other investment,and I will come to it very quickly.Then our love, especially of our parents,a fixed deposit.So I have written 1-yearfixed deposit rates of SBI herefrom 2012 to 2022,and if I look at it,â¹100 which you put in 2012would have become â¹205with all these fixed deposit rates.This means the money would have doubled,but if we convert it intoan annual rate of return,it becomes 6.8%.This means it's barely beatinginflation again,but less than inflation after tax,which means your money in fixed depositwas decreasing every year inits value to buy things.So what is it then that canbeat this inflation,and give you a much better return?Number 1: Corporate bonds.What are corporate bonds?Many companies need loans,and they go to banks for it,but they also come to people like usfor the loan,and they offer a fixed rate of returnfor a deposit,which usually is between 1-3 years.Corporate bonds can be very risky,because god forbid,if something happens to the company,then all your money can evaporatewhich is called a liquidity riskor default risk.So to save yourself from this,you should buy the corporate bondsof those companies onlywhich are high-quality companies.Their financials are good,their management team is good,their industry is stable,their market growth has been good,their market share is good.And for all these things you'll needsomebody to vet that informationand for that I personally use Wint.Wint has not sponsored this video,but a disclaimer,I am an investor in Wint,and previously I have made collaboratedvideos for Wint.So my opinion is biased,but whenever I invest in corporate bonds,I use Wint.I'll show you how it works.For example, there is SK Financewhich was launched in January 2023 only.If I look at its details,then you will get a sense thatwhatever money you invest,you will get it back on 5th April 2025.And if you invest around â¹1 lakh now,then almost on a guaranteed risk,because this is a fixed rate of return,on 5th April 2025, you will get â¹1,22,265,which translates intoa rate of return of 9.25%.This means it beats inflationto a great extent,it will still be above inflationafter taxes.The good thing is thatit is a fixed rate of return,so you do not have to take any risk.But as I said, the risk is thatif this company shuts down,or God forbid,something happens to the market,then their capability to repaythis loan will reduce.So what does WintWealth do in this?And there are many such players,there is not just Wint,they go through a vetting process.So they see,What do we like about this?SK finance has a long-term record,it is a 25-year-old company,there are marquee investorsin the company,they have a comfortablecapitalization profile,which means their market profilein terms of capitalization is quite good,debt equity ratio is good, and so on.They have also checkedthe criteria and risks.A lot of business comes fromthe state of Rajasthan,so if something happens there likea flood, earthquake, or who knows what,hope not,but if it does, then there are financials.So all of these things are there,please go through that,and then you invest in it,but corporate bonds are a good wayto ensure a steady rate of returnbeating the inflation.Then the next is All Weather Investing.In All Weather Investing,you don't just invest in gold,you basically invest ina portfolio of assets,where you know come what may,it will be a sustained investment.So you would invest in debtwhich is fixed income,as I said corporate bonds,then you would invest in gold and equity.A mix of these three gives youa stable return.All Weather Investing is somethingthat you can buy from smallcase.Again I made many videos about smallcase.I am in a long-term partnershipwith smallcase.This video is not sponsored by smallcase,but of course, I'll be biased in my view,because personally, every dollar I investin the equity markets in Indiais through smallcase.But don't take my word for it,please do your own research.But I will tell you how it works.In smallcase, around 42% of the moneyis in equity,and that too is in Nifty and junior Bs,which means it is in differentmarket capitalizations,top 50 companies or top companies,and then slightly smaller ones.And then 25% is in debtwhich is a fixed income,the companies which sellfixed income assetsthrough corporate bonds.And then about 34% in gold.With these three,the average rate of return is 10.24%,if you look at the last 5-year return,which again is a lot higherthan the inflation,it'll be higher even after deducting tax,and it is a lot more predictable,because it has very low volatility,it does not fluctuate much,your heart doesn't beat fasteron a daily basis.In fact, if I were to show you the graph,then you will see that this blue graphis very very sturdy,whereas the equity marketwent really low and then up again,but this will keep on moving slowly.If I compare it to FD, inflation,and all of that, then you will seeinflation is 5.15%, this data might befrom the last 5 years,at that time FD was giving around 5.5%,equity around 11%,and smallcase gave 10.72%,which is All Weather Investing smallcase.So it is relatively stable, of course,less than equity,but more than FD and inflation.Inflation proof!Then the third is real estate.The biggest problem with real estateis that while it gives youa rate of return,plus the good thing about real estateis that it gives youa rental yield as well.What is rental yield?If you buy any real estate propertyand rent it out,then you get a percentage of its valuein the form of rent every year.So if you add the rental yield,which is 1-2% for residential,could be 5-8% for commercial,plus if you add the appreciationof the property which is differentfor residential and commercial,depending on the city or the colony,so by combining these two,you can easily beat inflation.The problem is that real estate needsa lot of money in lakhs and crores,and we might not have it.So to solve this,there is a concept called REITs,Real Estate Investment Trusts.What are REITs?You can invest in the REITs launchedby good companies.For example, I am looking atthe REIT of Brookfield India.I am showing you this becauseI have personally invested in it.Again, do your own homework.There are only 3 REITs in India.One is by Embassy, one by Brookfield,and another by Mindspace.All three are business parks,which means they are office complexes,and what happens is after runningthese office complexes,whatever rental yield they get,the price of that particular REIT growsdepending on the growth of that yield.So think of it like a stock,but instead of buyinga stock of a company,you are buying a stock ofthe rental yield of an office complex,and then it grows accordingly.If you look at the graph,and this is for the last 5 years,there is steady growth.This growth is usually 8-10%,so it beats inflation, even after taxes.And the good thing about REITs is thatyou can buy them for cheap.For example, this REIT of Brookfieldis only for â¹273,which means technically you can buyreal estate for as low as â¹273,and that is brilliant because you geta predictable income streamand you are able to beat inflation.Number 4: US stocks.US stocks help you beat inflation.Why?Because they are disconnectedfrom your market.And why US?Because it is the world's biggest market.Particularly when it comesto global brands whose footprintis in the whole world,so you get a lot of market opportunityand you can grow on that.To show you the data you have to considertwo things in the US stocks.Number 1,how is the US Stock moving?But number 2,since you convert your moneyfrom rupees to US dollars,and USD also keeps increasingin comparison to the Indian Rupee,so when you again convertedinto Indian rupees,you get a gain because of that as well.So you will have to accountfor both the gains.Let's individually look atwhat those gains were.I am looking at S&P 500.These are the top 500 stocks in the US.Just like the Nifty 50 index,S&P 500 is a great index to invest in.If I look at the last 10-year dataand plot it,then in 2012,S&P 500 was at the level of around 1,400,and now by the end of 2022, it wasat the level of 4,000,which is an annual gain of 9.5%.Why struggle so much for 9.5%?However, what we haven't accounted foris the US dollar appreciation.So if I look atthe US dollar's appreciationover the last 10 years,so in the December of 2012,it was around 55 dollars, sorry â¹55,so that means US dollars increased by 50%.And that means on a yearly average,you got 9.5% from the US Stock Market,but you additionally got around 4.5%because of the US dollar appreciation.So you got a total ofaround 14% yearly increase,and that makes it awesometo beat inflation,and also after the tax,it continues to beat it.Based on this 5th and last,inflation-proof investmentis our Indian stock exchange.Indian Stock Exchange has performedremarkably in the last 10 years.This is the data.If you see the data of every yearfrom 2012 to 2022,this is the change, and that means,if we had invested â¹100in the Sensex in 2012,which is our index,then by the end of 2022it would be around â¹400which is four times.And that means,an annual rate of return of 13.3%.These five investmentscan beat inflation for you,and in 2022,there is a very interesting opportunity,where markets are going throughcorrections,a recession might be coming,there is a lot of confusion,and these are the momentswhen if you invest,you get to gain a lot for the future,because when you buy in the low market,you buy at better prices,you buy at attractive returns,and you thus make much better returnsover a long period of time.Whenever you invest anywhere,always ask yourself,am I beating inflation post-tax?Keep 6% in your mind,because you have to beat 6%every year after tax.If you are doing it,then you are on the right path.If you aren't then your moneyis losing its value every year.Don't make that mistake.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
