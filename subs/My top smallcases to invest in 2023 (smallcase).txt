If you are new to investing,then the best advice I can give you isdon't invest in stocks.What are you saying Ankur Warikoo?You keep making videos on stocks,and now you are saying,don't invest in stocks.You are nuts, you've lost it!No!Here's what I mean.Investing in stocks meansyou are buying a specific company's stock.Why are you buying that company's stock?Because your unclehas advised you to do so,or you've got a stock tip thatyou will become rich overnight,or worse,you think you should buy it in FOMO.This stock is so cheap, let's buy it.That stock has gone up, let's sell it.We are essentially not experts.We have just started our journey,and it is possible thatwe will stay in it for a long time.So if we will put so many obstaclesin front of us in the beginning itself,where we will buy the wrong stocksand hence lose money,and then we start blaming ourselves,we will never be able to enjoythe long-term benefit of stock investing.So the right way for a beginnerto start investing in stocksis to buy a portfolio of stocks,a group of stocks because thenyou manage your risk.If somewhere a stock doesn't work,then the other stock will cover up for it.I have basically abstractedthe fluctuation among these stocks.I am looking at a common return,and that's why I would want to do it.Now one way of doing it is mutual funds.Mutual funds are good and adequate,just as the ad says,but an interesting way thatI have been particularly usingin the last 4 plus years are smallcases.Smallcases are portfolios of stocksrepresenting an idea.An idea that you will most likelynever find in mutual funds.This is not a comparison betweenmutual funds and smallcases,but a video,in which I will share with youmy top 10 smallcases for 2023with the reason why.Let's get started.First of all, and genuinely,a great smallcase to start withis All Weather Investing.The name itself suggests thatthis is for all kinds of weather.Whether the market is up or down,this will consistently give youa good return.This is what I started withalmost 3 plus years back.I still have one of my best returnsfrom this smallcase,and I would highly recommend it.Why?Because it beautifully hasequity of around 42%,debt which is fixed income around 25%,and gold around 34%.This means you will enjoy the benefitand the mitigation of lossthrough the fluctuations ofgold, debt, and equity.It will give you about a 10% return,and this is for 5 years,which is very healthy to start with,and best of all,it is absolutely freeif you take it through smallcase.This will be my first starting pointfor a smallcase if you are just startingyour investing journey in 2023.Second:Top 100 Stocks.This is also a very simple approach.This will investin the top 100 stocks of India.Surprisingly, it is not easily availablein the market as an investment idea,but it is available in smallcase,and that's why I like it.It has two very simple approaches.80% are into Nifty BeESwhich are the top 50 stocks of Nifty,and 20% is in junior BeESwhich are the next top 50 stocks,and that's how it is calculated.This ratio can change quarterly,so whenever it changes,you will have to do a rebalancing process.I have made several videos explainingthe rebalancing process,and you can check out this video.That will tell youhow does rebalance works in smallcase.Again, absolutely free,and you can start withas low as around â¹2,000,which is such a great wayfor new investors to start.Third:Dividend Aristocrats.This is a very interesting smallcase.This is basically a group of stocksin which you regularly get dividends.What are dividends?Whenever a company makes a profit,it has two options.It can either invest the money backinto the company for growthor distribute it among the shareholders.When the profit is distributedamong the shareholders,it is called a dividend.And the best thing aboutthese dividend stocks is thatwithout selling the stocks,you earn a steady income onlythrough the ownership of those stocks.So this smallcase picks those stocksfor you.And there are a bunch of these,so don't think that they are final,because as I said, they get rebalanced.This one is annual, and you can seethat all these stocksare consistently proven to give outhigh and regular dividends,and if you take this,then for the ownership,you will keep gettinga regular dividend income,plus you will of course,continue to hold on to those stocks.I simply love it for this reason.Next:House of Tata.I love this because you getsuch ideas only in smallcase,which are not freely availablein the market.Let's say, you believe in Tataas a conglomerate,and you want to buy Tata stocksonly because you think they have a status,they work ethically,they have been growing stable for years,and you want to own all of it.But you also want tomaximize your returns,and you don't know all the companies,and how many stocks to buyof which company.So where will you getall this information from?You will have to build that expertise,but smallcase will do this for you.If you buy the House of Tata,you invest in Tata companies.Voltas, Titan, TCS, Tata Consumer,Chemical, Tata Steel, Tata Power,and the ratio is to maximize your returns.This ratio will keep changing,and it will happen quarterly,which will be the process of rebalancing,but you will basically investin all of the Tata companiesin the right ratio.A return of 27.81%.Though it is a new smallcase,only 2 years old,but still, it will give youa good sense of the positive outputthat you can get from a stable company,if you were to pick the companiesindividually under the conglomerate.You can start with â¹17,000,it's absolutely free on smallcase,you only have to pay the chargesof the equity brokeragewhich are very different charges.I made a video on all the chargesof smallcase as wellwhich you can check out.But this will be my suggestionfor 2023 because I am longon the TATA Group in general.While talking about long,and I don't know if you know what's long.In investing, being long meansyou are bullish on something,which means you believe thatthis will do better in the long run.That's long.And I am certainly longon electric mobility.EV vehicles are all around us,and we all want to buy an EV.Their running cost and servicing costare really low.Yes, they're slightly expensive right now,but gradually, even that cost will reduce.And if you had an option of investingin all the companies which arecreating this electric mobility revolutionin India or maybe even outside,then why wouldn't to do that?So this smallcase is purely to investin those companies where electric mobilityis a dominant part of their business.Let's see which are those companies.I don't even know most of these names.There is Amara Raja in batteries.In two-wheelers, of course,there is Bajaj and Hero.Both of them have started goinginto electric vehicles.In auto parts, and these will againbe companies whose names you may not know,because we are not experts,we only have a superficial knowledgeof what is being done.In industrial machinery,there is Greaves Cotton.In oil and gas, there is IOCL.In IT services, there is KPIT.In four-wheelers,there is Mahindra and Mahindrawhich is making amazing cars.In power generation, there is Tata Power.All of these are in some way facilitatingthe electric mobility movement,and if you invest in these companiesin this ratio,then you will maximize your returnin a way that helps you ride this wave.CAGR is less right now,because there was not a lot of movementfor the past 5 years,and that is why for 2023,I am predicting thatnow the electric movementwill go through the roof,and this is a bet that you cantake this year through smallcase.One industry runs successfully,come what may,and that is the IT industry.In my opinion, in 2023-24,the IT industry will grow even more,because I feel there will bea recession in the world.And whenever there is a recession,the first thing people dois to start cutting out costs on labour,on human resources,but the work needs to be donebecause the company has to run,so gradually that work is outsourced,and that quality of work canonly happen in India.India is a place wherevolume and quality both coexistwhen it comes to Information Technology.So if you want to investin those companies,then this smallcase allows you to do that.Let's look at those companies.Coforge, HCL, Infosys, MindTree,Mphasis, Persistent, TCS, Tech Mahindra,KPIT, Oracle, your usual suspects,but their ratio is interesting.You wouldn't know how it is createdbecause you are not an expertor we are not an expert,there will be someonewho will be doing it,they will be doing it quarterly,so you will do the rebalancing,and in one click your full portfoliowill be refreshed,and you will continue toenjoy the benefit.It is again a completely free smallcasethat starts at â¹62,000 minimum investmentto be made at a one-time level.Once you will do this,then you can do a regular monthly SIP,and that is completely your choicewhich is not the minimum amount.You can set the SIP for any amount,and it will then start deductingit every month.Now let's move toa few interesting smallcases.Interesting in the sense thatthese are slightly risky,they are of course not free,there's a high level of expertiseattached to them,but they are my favoritebecause they ride on somethingthat I call the momentum strategy,which is called the momentum strategy.Basically, momentum strategy meanswhen the stocks are on a rise,it is seen that before fallingthey rise a little more,so there is momentum.When you have a positive momentum,it continues before it starts falling,and you will bet on that momentumwhich is called the momentum strategy.For the past 3 years,I have made most of my investmentin the Indian equity market throughthe momentum strategy only,amongst these three small casesthat I will show to you.The first one is Value and Momentum.This is a paid smallcase.You can get access to it startingat â¹2,000 for 3 months,and since it is paid,I will not show its stocksand their weights,because that will be unfair,but you can see that it will give youor at least for the last 7 yearsit has given a CAGR of 24%.If you are getting a CAGR of 24%,this means your money is gettingdoubled every 2.5-3 years,which is insaneif you can get that rhythm.And of course, it is a great smallcaseto start with if you want to explorethe momentum strategy.35,000 is the starting point.Now let's come to two of my favoritemomentum smallcases that I have investeda bulk of my money in.The first one is Mi MT Allcapby Weekend Investing.This is a smallcase whereat least 20 stocks are selectedon the basis of momentum strategy.It is rebalanced every week,so it's a very active portfolio,but the good thing is somebody elseis actively monitoring it,you don't have to do it,but the day it is updated,you will have to refreshthat portfolio through one click,so that you can benefit fromthe momentum that's happening.The CAGR is 28% which is insane,and 57,000 is the minimum amount.It is slightly expensive startingat â¹5,000 for 3 months.If you want to invest a good amount,then my suggestion will be to takethe 12-month plan which is for â¹15,000,but to ensure that the â¹15,000is actually a good costand not a very high cost,you should invest more thana minimum of â¹5 lakhs in it,otherwise, â¹15,000 would be a lotif you invest â¹50-60 thousand onlyannually.So it is for the high-ticket investors,and of course,you get really good returns.I am a proven customerfor the last 3 years,and I can vouch for that.My second favorite momentum strategyis Capitalmind Momentum by Capitalmind.Again 28%.Surprisingly,Capitalmind and Weekend Investing,both of them claim the momentum strategy,but I have often observedthat every week their suggestionsare different.So in some way,I've been able to diversify.In some week, the momentum of Capitalmindwould be better, and in some other week,the momentum of Weekend investingwould be better.And again, it is a weekly rebalance.Starts at â¹40,000.And it is also a paid smallcase.Finally, a very very interesting smallcasecalled the BM Vision 2030 smallcase.I made a detailed video on this,but the idea of this isconcentrated 12 stockswhich are Basant Maheshwari investing,these are smallcase managers, the experts,basically, the people who knowthe ins and outs of which stock to buy,when to buy and sell, so on and so forth,and they will do all the hard work for us.So they will pick 12 such stockswhich they know can beat the Nifty 50which is the top 50 stocks in India,and they will of course keep makingthat happen.The good thing is that it is doneonly on a need base,so the rebalance is not very frequent,it happens whenever it needs to.The entry point is very high.It starts with â¹5 lakhs,and you will have to pay 2.5%of the investment value.So, if you start with â¹5 lakhs,then you will have to give â¹12,500for access to this smallcase.It is again,a fairly high return smallcase,around 22-23%.It is quite new, but certainly,something that has a lot of potential,because it has been created witha decade-long worldview or timeline.It is not something in whichyou'll invest for a couple of years only,it is something that you will investfor a really long period,and that's why the 2030 vision,the name of the small case.These are my top 10 recommendationsfor smallcases in 2023.As I said, these recommendations arebecause I've personally invested in them.Please do your research to figure outwhether they make sense for you or not.A lot of these smallcases are free,and some of them are paid.If you choose the paid one,then please invest an amountby which the expense becomes 1-3%and not more.And the one thing thatis always most important is thatwhenever you invest in equities,please invest with a long-term view.A long-term view is at least 3-5 years,and ideally 10-15-20 years.If you want to test the stock marketfor 1-2 years,and that is your perspective,you may burn your fingers,because the markets are very volatile.You can lose money quickly,and if you are not ready for that,then you should not come in.You should only come in when you comewith a long-term view.I hope this was helpful.If you have any questions,please ask in the comments section,and I will be happy to answer.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
