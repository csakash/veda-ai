Fixed ScheduleProductivity reminds me;Because Fixed ScheduleProductivity tells you that to do any task, impose a deadlineso that the task iscompleted on time. It reminds methat for Australiaâstop universities,the enrollment deadline is the end of July.And that means thatfor this yearâs admission,you have to apply by July.And if you are still not sureof which university to apply?Or which course?Or the application process?Or if you are eligiblefor scholarship or not?Or visa assistance willbe provided or not?Or after you reach there,how will you getaccommodation?And all of those questions,then my recommendationwould beLeverage Edu.This video is sponsoredby Leverage Edu,who are one of Indiaâs topconsulting firmswhen it comes tostudying abroad. A lot of students,every yeargo through Leverage Edu and I would love for you to consider them.I am an investorin this company so I am quite biased.But Akshay Chaturvedi,the founder of Leverage Edu,is from ISB;Thatâs where I didmy MBA as well.So, I am knownhim for many years and I know how much efforthe and his teambuilds into making this workfor all of the studentswho have benefittedfrom the servicesof Leverage Edu.Please explore them.And ultimately,it is your choice to make. But I really hopethat if you wantto study abroad, which in my opinion is a great thing to dothen theymight be helpful for you.Pinned commentand descriptionhave their link.
