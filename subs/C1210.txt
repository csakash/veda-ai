Let's get started.Every day when you leave homethere is a possibilitythat you may meet an accident.This video is not dark.This video is abouta very important thingthat consumes so many of usevery single day of our lives.We spend our whole life overthinking.We keep thinking aboutwhat all bad things can happen to us.All those things which wethink might happen to us,we start thinking of themas a reality,and that consumes us.So I'll ask you the question again,Every day when you step out ofyour house, is therea possibility that you maymeet an accident?Yes.Then why do you stillstep out of the house?How is it that you are ableto convince yourselfthat nothing is going to happen to you?What is that belief withwhich you step out?What is that belief withwhich you do everythingwhere there is always a possibilitythat something uncalled formay happen with you,something would happen with youthat you wouldn't wish for yourself,for your family,for your loved ones?When I thought about overthinking,I realized that the biggest thingthat consumes overthinkersis the difference betweenpossibility and probability.And that is the first thing,if you are an overthinkeryou tend to overthink,you need to recognize.There is a possibilitythat something can happen or not,and the truth is,anything can happen in this world.If you think something badis going to happen to you,there is an absolute possibilityof that happening.If you think you will be fired,if you think you will have a breakup,if you think you will never besuccessful in life,if you think all your friendswill leave you,if you think your parentsare not happy with you,if you think you area burden on this world,each and everything that you havethought about yourselfand your life can be a reality.There is a possibility thatthat is true.The question is,what is its probability?What is the probability ofthat thing happening?Because when you combinethat possibility with that probability,that is when you havethe first semblance ofa rational approach towardsyour overthinking.We always imagine thatwhatever is going on in our minds,whatever wrongs that we thinkare going to happen with us,the things we don't wantto happen with us,we completely removethe probability of that happening.What is the probability ofthat thing happening?Let's go back to the first question.When you step out ofyour house every day,is it possible that you maymeet an accident?Yes.But what is its probability?And you know from your experiencethat its probability is minimal.God forbid if you meet an accident,God bless this should never happen to you,and even if it happens then ata very small level,you almost know thatthe probability of that happeningis very low.And that gives you the confidenceto step out.But every story that we weavein our minds, we do not do it withthat level of probability.So the first thing to do,if you find yourself inthe trap of overthinking,is to dissociate the possibilityof something from the probabilityof it happening.And until you do not convinceyourself of that,you are going to strugglewith this overthinking.How do you do that?It only happens when you talk tothose people who will convince youthat the probability ofwhat you are thinking is notas much as you think it is.Because you have no way ofexperiencing it.If you would have experienced it,you would already know about it,just the way you know,that if you step out,the probability of meeting withan accident is very very low.But you don't know if you do something,is there a possibility that you will befired because of it?You don't know if you say these things,you portray yourselfas a particular person,will a relationship be ruined?You don't know if you take these steps,did you have successor failure in your life?You don't know!And so, you have to speak toevery possible person outsideof your own mind,who can tell you whatthe probability of that is.And I can guarantee this,you will get a lot of different reactions.You will meet a lot of peoplewho failed in school or college,but they are still very happyin their life.A lot of people who did very wellin their school or college,but are not happy in life.A lot of people who don't seemto be happy in a relationship,but they actually are happy in that.And two people who seem to be madefor each other, and yet,behind the scenes,they make themselves miserable.Each and every example would beimportant for you to build thatprobability that you need to know.When you do that, you are stillstuck in your mind, right?Though you got a theoretical frameworkfrom all of these,I have to disassociatepossibility and probability,but I am in this moment right now,I feel that right now my life is a waste,right now I feelthat I do not have a way out,I feel stuck!And the biggest thing that helpswhen you are in that momentwhere you are stuck,is not to think of yourselfin the end state.If you are not happy with your life,then it would seem impossible to be happy.If your relationship is shattering,you are not getting successin your career,it would seem impossible,how will you get out of it?So don't think too much about itand demotivate yourself,because that will seem so far away.It would seem like a Mount Everest jobthat you will never be able to climb.Instead, take the smallest possible stepthat gets you out of where you are.The smallest possible step that you canto get you out of where you are.You are fired, and you feel likeeverything is going horrible for you.Through your overthinking you areconvincing yourself that no goodwill happen in your life,you will never be successful,you will never be able to achieveyour parents' or your own dreams,and you are choking yourself to misery.In that moment, nothing helps.Yes, a probability thatwhat is the probabilitythat I will be like thisfor my whole life?Very low, very very low.There is a possibility,but the probability is so low thatthat should give you the confidenceto take the first step,and the first step thenis not to feel happy,to be absolutely successful,no!The first step is to start applying.Send an application for the firstjob opening that you find.Send a cold email to the first founderthat you can come across.Relook at your resume,and make it betterthan what it was yesterday.The smallest step that you cantake that's well within your controlto get you out of the positionthat you are in,and do that every single day,because until you don't do that,you will find yourself in the same spot.And I can guarantee this in writing,do you know who is your biggest enemyin this world?That person who makes you believethat you are stuck in life,that you cannot do anything in life,you are helpless.That person is your biggest enemy,and that person could very well be you.And then the third and the final thing,document this whole journey.Write down how are you feeling.Record your voice.Shoot videos.Whatever it takes!Do you know why?Because when this happensin your life again,and it will surely happen,it will happen to all of us, problems anddifficulties never leave anybody,they come back,and this will also come back,you need to rememberhow you got out of it.You will have to document everythingwhich you will forget tomorrow.You won't remember how you feltin that moment,that you are feeling right now.You will forget it all!And it will shock you later on inthe future that you felt this way.I remember, I have a very dear friendwho works at a great designationin a US-based company,but to get into that company,she worked so hard witha lot of dedication year on year,that it was crazy,it was unbelievable!She for me is the biggest testimonyof hard work that I have seen in anybody.But she did not have confidencein herself.She believed that she wouldn't get it.She was convinced in her mindthat despite doing all these things,she will not get that job.And there was this one daywhen she felt different.She sent me a message saying,'Warikoo, I think I will get this job.I think that I've worked so hardthat I deserve to be in this spot,and I think I will get it.I know I will get it!'And then suddenly again, the next day,her overthinking mind took over.'I am not going to get it.I am not getting any responses from them.This happened, that happened!Does this mean that?Does that mean that?'And when it happened for 2-3 days,I copy-pasted that messagethat she had sent,and sent it back to her.And you know what her response was?'Oh my God!I can't believe this was me!I can't believethat I said all this for myself!'It was almost as ifshe had a memory lapse.It was almost as if she didn'teven remember what she had gone through.And that's true for everybody.We don't remember what happened to us.And it is so important for youto document every single thingthat you go through,because when the situationsare great or bad,you want to go back to that timewhen the situations were worseor really great, and remind yourselfof what it was to feel that way,of what it was to be in that moment.When you do that, your frameworkof probability and possibility,becomes more substantial,more convincing,because you will now haveconcrete data pointsto tell you what works,and why does it work,and to what extent does it work.Overthinking can paralyze a lot of people,and it does too, and I hopethat when you begin to thinkabout your overthinking in the waythat I described,you get clarity and a directionto move forward.Ankur warikoo, signing off!
