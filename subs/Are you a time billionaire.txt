Check 1, 2.Piyush, there is a task for you.Open Google Docsfor this video's folder.And in that there is a linkof Sahil Bloom's threadwhich is basicallybased on which this video is made.Andits cover image is avery beautiful imageabout a father and a son's journey,that how the fatherraises his son andthen the son ultimatelytakes care of his fatherand then ultimatelythe father dies.This, if you can,make it into a 30 secondemotionalmotion graphic.So I don't want you to addany motion.I only want thatthere are 9 images,pick themand individuallyputting them in afade in and fade outmanner,with a very beautifulemotional music,make it like a montage.Andits reference will beits reference will belet meshare that reference with you.The reference for thisI havegiven.It is about 4-4:30 minutes,it need not be this long.30 seconds. Ask Shaurya also once,whether this will be a good start tothe video or not, but I feel wherethey will certainly be.It will certainly be a good one, soyou should try that.If it is not needed, you can startthe way I am starting right now.Alright,let's get started.Youare a time billionaire.A timebillionaire.What is a time billionaire, Ankur?I have a question for you -how much is a million seconds?If I ask you thathow much are million secondsin hours, days, weeks?What do you think?You can pause and write inthe comments - what is theduration of one million seconds?Pause and write.Done writing?I will give the answer.Million seconds are11 days.Approximately 11 daysare million seconds.So if I ask you again -how much are billion seconds?Million seconds are 11 days.How many are billion seconds?So we think,how many can they possibly be,it is 1000% more,so maybeit will be somethingaround 11 years.31 years.One billion secondsare 31 years.And I,through this video,have one purpose -that I convince all of youthat you areat least onetime billionaire,and ideally,two time billionaires.And thatis what makes youtruly rich.The concept of time billionairewas introduced by an investor -Graham Duncan. And he would say thatyoung peoplethink - 'We don't have money, cars,luxury, wealth,expensive clothes,house, all of this.When will we become a billionaire?'And frankly,there is not a single day,not a single day,when I don't receive an emailfrom a 16 years oror 18 year old kidsthat, "Sir,till I turn 21 years old,I want to become a billionaire."And that is not going to happen.Not because you are not smart.Because to become a billionaire,it takes a lot of time.To be able to earn anet worth of Rs. 8,500 crore,is very, very, very difficult.But, there is somethingthat we are already bornwith. If you arearound 20 years oldand estimate that youwill live till 80 years,this means thatin your life,you alreadyare 2 time billionaires.Because at the age of 20,you will live atleast 70 years more,which is equal totwo billion seconds.If you are around 50years old, then youare one time billionaire,meaning you have one billion secondsin your life.And thatis a fascinating concept.Because timeis our life's biggestasset. With time, we can improveour relationships,we can improve our work,we can learn something new,we can go anywhere,we can make any amount of money,we can meet many people,we can buy anything.All of this is possiblebecause we havetime. And that,will ensurealmost everythingelse. But we do nottreat this time properly.There's a beautiful sayingwhich says, 'The days are longbut the weeks are short.'This means that when weare spending our day,we feel thatthere is so muchhappening in the day,fights are also happening,there is love as well, we are eatingsomething, watching something,we are wasting time,doing some productive work as well,learning something as well,earning as well. So it feels likea lot has happened during the day.But, suddenly,week after week,our weeks are going by.Suddenly we are in the month of May.5 months of thisyear have passed by.We did not even realize.And just like that,a year passes by,2 years pass, 3 years pass.And we don't even realize thatwhere our time passed.As a parent it hits you the hardest,which is what this beautiful imageand thisIf you have made the video,then use the video phrase,if you haven't,use the image.As a parent, it hits you the hardest.Because you don't even realize howthis time with your child passes by,as you can see in this image.as you can see in this movie.as you could see in this movie.It's a beautiful rendition.Vidur is now 12 years old.And I cannot even believe thathe is 12 years old.One year more and he willbecome a teenager and then gone!Then, my daysand my time with him is numbered.He will spend time with his friends,he might go out before he turns 18,then his life will be somewhere else,some other city, country, planet.And the last thing I knowisin my entire life,I have only little time,only few moments remainingwith Vidur,with Uzma,with my wife,with my friends,with my parents,with myself.And that is thetime billionaire concept.But in the time billionaire concept,this one thingBut in the time billionaire concept,it is not that money is notrespected or having moneyis a very bad thing. No.It is not. In fact, if youare going abroad for studies,then I recognize howtough it can be to send moneyoutside, how tough it can be toarrange a loan for your studyabroad education. I have gonethrough all this, I know what it is.And that's whythis video is sponsoredby Leverage Edu and particularlyFly Finance.Fly Finance is a very interestingand powerful initiativeby Leverage Edu, which takescare of all your financing needswhen you go study abroad. They cansend your money abroad for youat really affordable andcheap rates with absolutelytransparent pricing.They can arrange a loan for youat a very attractive interest rate.They can send the moneyfor your accomodationor if you want to buy anything else.All of those nitty grittieswhich are necessarybut are also verytroublesome if you want to go abroad,all of this is managed byFly Finance by Leverage Edu.So please check it outif you are planning to go outand you're struggling with eitheryour finances or transferring moneyoutside of India.The link is in the pinned commentand description to check outFly Finance by Leverage Edu.Sahil Bloomrecently wrote a thread onthis time billionaire conceptwhich became theinspiration for this video.And in that, heshared a very powerfulimagewhich is on the lines ofthat 'The days are longbut the weeks or the years areshort.'So you can see this image.In this image, 52 weeksof the year are there and thenvertically, your years are plotted.1, 5, 10 and so on.And you will see that eachcircle is a week.And as your circleskeep increasing,your time keeps reducing.If you are around 25 years,then you have already filled25 lines and the completecircle of 52 weeks.And God forbid,it is thought provoking thatif your parents have20 or 30 years remaining,and youdo not stay in the same city as them,maybe youmeet them once or twice in a year.It feels like we yet have20-30 years with our parents, buttechnically, if you canmeet them only once a year,then you do not have 20-30 years,you have 20-30 chances,20-30 moments,20-30 opportunitiesto meet with your parents. Andwhen you think in this way,it strikes youthat how powerful this conceptof time is.And it goes the other way as well.If you are going througha bad time,the things you wantedaren't happening with you,you are stuck in something,you are giving an exam,or you are giving interviews,nothing is happening,maybe your relationshipsare broken, and youfeel like, 'Oh my God!I am 20 years oldor 25 years or 30 years,and I haven't done anythingin my life till now',it's very easyto look at the years gone byand saythat 'I have not doneanything in life till now.What have I even achieved?'But it isimmensely importantto look at not just thetime that has gone by,but the time that is left.When you will be filling this chartand your 25 years are over,you still have 75 yearsof life ahead of you.Or whatever that number is.It can be 60, 50.But far more than 25.And that is your time,that is your moment,that is what you can do.This is the timewhich you can controland achieve anything.It only takes timeand nothing else.That is the power of life.A graph which Sahilshared in the Twitter thread oftime spent withchildren and you will seethat it increases gradually,it peaks around theage of 30-35,and then falls gradually.And this isthe trend. A parent's lifewith their childgoes till one peakand then it is a kind of goodbye,and it goes back.This same thingyou can see with your familywhere during your youth,you used to spend the most amountof time with your family,and then slowly,that time gets over.This same thingyou see with yourself,then it hits you the hardest.You spendlittle time with yourselfand as people startleaving your life,your parents, your children,your partner, your friends,you start spending moretime with yourself.And that may not be a choice.That may notbe something that you want.It may not be something thatyou needed in life, but itis not something you can escape.You will have to spendtime with yourself.That timewhich is defining your everything,you will spend it mostwith yourself.The question will bewhat will you do.Recently, Iwon't share with whom,but I was talking to someone whois 70 years old.And,I remarked that,"The one mistake whichyou have made in lifewas that youdid not developany habits.'Neither a reading habit,nor a learning habit,nor a habit to play something,nor a habit to meet people,nor a habit to do something new.And because of that,at the age of 70 years,you almost feel like thereis nothing left in your day,there is nothing in your day.And you feel directionless."You don't want to come on that point,You don't want to reach that point.Your life is so preciousthat every moment of yoursis removing few dollarsout of your billion time dollars.Each and every moment.And it is now your decisionthat what you dowith it.First mistake that wemake with our time -we keep avoid our timeto become successful.We say that, 'Oh, when I get 'x',I will become happy.When I get 'y',I will become happy. When I do 'z',I will become happy. When I do that,I will become happy.'We always procrastinateour happiness,our life, our lifestyle,on somethingon something that willhappen in the future.That moment is today itself, friends.Right now is the moment.If we let now go, then we don't knowwhether tomorrow will come or not.You are a time billionaire today.And everyday,if you want it or not, you willspend your time.From that time billionaire'sbank account, some moneywill keep reducing everyday.You cannot let that go to waste.Please do not postponeyour happiness,your life.Don't say that, 'When I retire,then I will enjoy all thosehappiness filled things.When I turn 25and I will have enough bank balance,then I will enjoy this.When I turn 30 and I willhave that bungalow, car,then I will enjoy that.'No.Everything that you have todaycan be and should beenjoyed.Don't make this mistake.Mistake number 2 -understandingthat moneycan win over time.No.Warren Buffet,who is one of theworld's richest persons,is 93 years old,if I am not wrong.And he has nearly 100billion dollar net worth.My question to you is -Will you exchange Warren Buffet'slife with your life?And maybe some people,maybe some peoplesay, "Yes, we will."But if you say thisthen maybe you are not realizingthe importance of time.The correct answer is 'No, we won't.'Why? Because at the age of 93,what will you even dowith 100 billion dollars?Only few years are left.Only moments are left.You, at the age of 20, 25,30, whatever your age is,you can actually get tothat number and perhaps even more.or you don't evencare about that numberand yet have your life.Warren Buffetcannot buy your time from youirrespective of thecrores of money he might have.Warren Buffetwould want to become 25 againby giving anything, but he cannot.You, at the age of 25,can do anythingand reach there.And perhaps, before 93.That is the power of time.So whenever,especially in relation to youryouth,youth sounds veryweird, I don't know why.Especially when you are young,young sounds very cool.When you are young,you are a youth,youth suddenly sounds veryEspecially when youare young,never make this mistakethat for money,you sell your time.Don't make that mistake.The higher price you canattach for your time,you can respect it,try to do it. And youshould have only one focusthat is increasing theimportance of your time. For example,what is your per hour rate?Many memes have also beenmade on this because I hadmade a video on this that'What is your per hour rate?'and then you know you bring inprostitutes and sex workersand so on, which is likesuch a poor joke on it, but anyway.If you are earningand let's say you work 40 hoursa week.According to that, let'scalculate your per hourly rate.And your life's -There should be only one focusof your life that I canincrease the importanceof this per hourly rate.Because that is when you knowyou are valuing your time.That isthe mistake that most people make.Don't value their time.They feel that time isfree, they will spend it onanything, it does not have anyimportance, it doesnot have any price.Don't make thatmistake. And then mistake nunber 3 -imagine,in your day,everyday,I depositRs. 86,400 in your bank account.Rs. 86,400,it is a very specific number.But because of a reason.So, everyday,without fail, Rs. 86,400 isdeposited in your bank account.And God forbid, it happens thatin the morning, your Rs. 400get lost.Someone steals it.Will you spend the remainingRs. 86,000 to find those Rs. 400?Yes or no?No, right?Because you are smart.That's not what you should do.But in real life,you do exactly this.Everyday,when we wake up,in our account,86,400 secondsare deposited,which isequal to 1 day's seconds. 86,400is the number of secondsin a day.And God forbid,someone takes away our400 seconds from us,says something,abuses something,there is a fight on the road,or there is a fight with our parents,or siblings, friends,or with our spouse,or with our children,and then the entire day,entire day,we spend it thinking about that.We waste our entire daybehind those 400 seconds.By repeating it continuously,thinking about it.There are several thoughts.That's it.Those 86,000seconds are gone.Don't make that mistake.Don't make that mistake.If you don't make these3 mistakes in your life,then your time billionaire statuswill remain constant.It willmake you a billionaire in reality.Whether it is abillionaire of happiness,billionaire of time,or an actual billionaire of money.But till you don't understandthe concept of time billionaire,you don't absorb it,you don't appreciate it,you will never be ableto appreciate your time,you will never be able to respect it.And you will always feel that eitheryou are only running behind timeor that timenever supports you.Both of whichis not true,is not right.Ankur Warikoo,signing off.
