Super, okay.Very quick intro.Hey everyone.Today, on YouTube,I have the lovely Vir Das.Who has been entertaining usfor several, several years now.I love to have this conversation with him.Thank you so much, Vir.I love the sarcasticseveral, several, several years.Hey, absolutely, it's like, you know,It feels like I am seeingso many sides of youbecause you have also changedso much over the years.I don't know how old you areI'm 42 and think I've seen you for--I am your age. So yeah.So, literally half of my life or so,in so many different forms.But my first question for you is,what do you think, has changed the mostin you in the last 10 years?By the way, you can edit this out.Is there a language you guys prefer?Because I can do--No there's nothing.If you are comfortable with Hindithat is perfect.But I...Yes, I am very comfortablewith Hindi, absolutely.That would be great then.So, let me then ask the question again.A little bit in a Hindi flavour.So that you get into that mode.All right.So, Vir, my first question to you is.In the last ten years,what has been the biggest changethat you have seen in yourself?First thing is my background.And by backgroundI do not mean my family background,I mean my actual background.Where every room I've been,has been equally untidyas it has in the last 10 years.Your room is great,there's 'Do Epic Shit' behind youand all of that stuff.See my plug point,cord, etc. everything is there.Everything is visible.And I think,it's very symbolic for my life.In the last 10 years,I think,Maybe you wouldn't be funny enough.Maybe you wouldn't be artistic enough,But accessing yourself and your own messbecomes easier.So, just who you are, reaches the pageas years pass by.So, I think that is what has changed.When I write,what I am actually,that's coming to the forefront more.I think that's the only thingthat really happens in 10 years.That's not just for...Nonfiction or stand-up.I think when you write films,or when you write a series,then also you--You've lived so much enoughthat you starting to put peopleYeah.Into your films,in your series, in your stand-up.There is not fiction anymore.There is no fiction anymore.Yeah, yeah, I so agree with that.Wonderful. One thing,when you reflect upon your life,particularly, 20s.A large part of my contentis around people in their 20s.The one thingthat consistently ties them in,Which I am sure,you will also be able to relate.Because we too have passedthrough that phase.You make so many mistakesand you feelthat was the biggest mistake of your lifeand you will never be able to recoverfrom that.And then of course, life is big enough.You go on and you realize,that no you have chances.In your 20s, go back to that time,Which such error, mistake, event,situation happened with you?That you felt,you will never be able to recover from.Okay, frozen.I think we have lost Vir.So, weâre just waiting for him.Sorry man, my bad.I don't know why...The internet just gave outfor some reason. I am not sure of that.No problem at all man.Are we back in?I remember the question,so I can jump back inif you wanna, this thing.Yeah, yeah. If you heard the question,so, yeah go ahead.I think the biggest regret of 20sAside from 2-3 select relationshipsBecause, you know...I'll answer it in two parts.I think in your 20syou date the person that you deserve.That happens very rarely.And sometimes, you date peoplethat you have convinced yourselfin your mind that you don't deserve,you know.And that is largely a reflectionof how you feel about yourselfin those momentsSo, I think, definitely in my 20s,I dated at least two girls,to I am like, please don't leave me.The whole relationship was like,please stay with me.Where are you going?Please don't leave me and go, etc, etc.Nothing will push a woman awayfaster than that.The inherent insecurity.But, I think also, in late 20sI made a mistake,when I started getting work in filmsand started getting work on TVI neglected stand-up a bit,I had a reunion with standupWhen I was 35, I think,I just fell back in lovewith the art form againand that led toto this inning of my career.But it was like getting back togetherwith an old loverwho I had neglectedfor a very, very long time.Sometimes I thinkthat in those 5-6 yearsif it had not been neglected so much,I would have been so much further aheadin my comedic journey by now,So that I regretI lost time with stand-up.Got it, got it.And then on that question itself,it's beautiful that you say thisbecause often we feelthat you havenât given time to that thing,because of that you fell behind.And it actually takes a lotto even get started all over again.Because when you came backinto the stand-up scene,almost 7 years back.It's not that you were the only one still.The world had changed.So many people had started.Hindi comedy had become a big thing.Hindi stand-up had become a big thing.There were people left, right, and centercreating massive appreciationand love for what we had to do.And you were in some way, the OG of it alland now you werenâtand you had to startalmost like a fresher.How did that, like how did--What did you even tell yourselfto get started?I'm always very excited by that.There is no happier place for methan the bottom of a ladder.I like being at the bottom of a ladder.But, what had happened to me man,is I'm kind of doing my career in reverse.I really am, in terms of,I came to India,and the stand-up scene was absent here.So, suddenly owing to novelty,It's been 3 years since doing stand-up,but you are selling a thousand tickets.You are filling in the big halls.And you are not ready for that.Anywhere else where stand-uphas a proper demarcated scene.Where there are milestonesto growth as a comedian.You spend the first 10 years in the club.Taking those 5-5 minutes,you hone those 5-5 minutes, etc, etc.Then adding those 5 minutes together,you have a very nice 90-minute show.I used to straightaway write90-minute shows.An audience of thousand used to reach.So, I had not discoveredhow to hone stand-up.I had not discoveredhow to really micro focuson every single joke.On pacing, on dynamics.So, you almost lost excitement.Because every weekend2,000 people were coming to see you.You had already reachedwhere you want to reachand it felt boring.Because I was not writing new materialand then I think 2015 maybe,I had been to the US.There were some meetingsand I did a five-minute spotin a club, in Laugh factory.And now I was like man I feel better.And I killed it.I'm gonna be honest.I did very, very well.And I followed 3-4 comedians.Where instead of worrying about my set,I would have wanted their autograph.They were so famous.I went up and followed.I followed well, and I'm like hey man.I feel better about this than I feltabout the last 3 projectsthat I have done, back home.So, then I cleared a year of my schedule.I just kind of travelled everywhereto small, small clubs.Even in India,I started work shopping in clubs.Really kind of re-joinedthe stand-up scene back thenand then what you tell yourself is man,I believe in purity of intention.I believe that if you can write one line,and everything that fallswithin the pattern of that lineyou will embraceand everything that does not fallwithin the pattern of that line,you will reject immediately.So, I think, I wrote downon a piece of paper.I said I want to bea global Indian comedy voice.So, I want to create content out of Indiawith an Indian perspectivethat everybody in the world can enjoy.So then...suddenly everything falls into place.Now, I have to travel the world.I can't spend 9 months a yearin a and vanity van in Malad,somebody is getting you sandwich, etc.Itâs not going to happen like that.So, you have to really followthat intention.I think that's what happened with me.Wonderful, fantastic man.That's really nice.Going back to your 20s.Any such lie, the world has told you,or a lie you told yourselfthat you now know, was course, a lie.That you believed it to be trueat that point.Yes, that people in their 40shave any rightto give you advice in your 20s.Thatâs the main this thing.As you get older you discoverthat 40-year-olds are just childrenwith acid reflux.That's all, 40-year-olds are.We are childrenwith balding and acid reflux.What I have figured out how it works is.55-year-olds run the world.55 and above actually run the worldand they run the world by stealing ideasfrom 25-year-olds.New-age people.40-year-olds are fucking irrelevantuntil we hit 55.Because we are irrelevantto the guys below usand we don't have enough cloutto manipulate the guys above us.So, if you are in your 20stake advice from a 55 and aboveand take advice from a 25-year-old.If a 45-year-olddecides to give you advice.Tell him to go screw himself.Thatâs what I have learnt, I think.Itâs so, thank you, thank you.I needed it to hear thisto feel afraid about myself.Not specifically you.But you understand what I'm sayingNo, in terms ofâ¦I totally get it.40-year-olds, we like to pretendlike we have a clue.We have no clue what we are doing.Awesome.In which phase of your lifewere you earning the most money?Or is it now?I don't want a bad omen,but life is pretty good right now.Thatâs it. Iâll just say that much.How do you spend your money?I have a rule,which is set by me and my wife.I am still following it.Madam gave up the rule in 2 months.The rule was,I have five T-shirts.I have two pairs of pants.Have two sweaters.Have one warm jacket.Have one denim jacket.One is my normal shoes.One is my workout shoes.And that is my wardrobe.And its everything that I own in my life.So, this year, I did 25 countrieswithout check-in luggage,just with hand-carry luggage.So, the rule is.We will spend any amount of moneyon hospitality, food, travel,music and experiences.On this, letâs go first class.Letâs go, suite.Letâs go, front row seats.Letâs go, best restaurant in town.But I am not buying a jeans.You know what I mean?I am not buying a Louis Vuitton bag.I'm not buying possessionsand I think what happened was man,we have been in Goa for 3 years.We came to Goa mid-pandemic.Because we had a dog.His name is Dr. Watsonand he was quite sick.In mid lockdown,I was like man,he needs fresh airand he will not make it in Bombay.So, I want to give hima good last 2 years of life.So, we moved to Goa.But we had set out during the lockdown.So, we only had enough luggage spaceto come in one car.Right.Largely with Watsonâs stuff.Then second priority was my wifeâs stuff.I got to pack one suitcase.I came to Goa in this housethat is my landlordâs houseand it was furnished, etc,but for 1-1/2 years,I didnât go back to Bombay.We locked that entire house.Then I discovered, manI just want this suitcase.I don't need anything morethan whatever is in this tiny suitcasethat I packed.So, that changed my mindset a little bit.Beautiful, I love that.Do you also actively invest?I don't actively invest.I am very bad, manNo man, the thing is,and this is probably good advice for kids.I've, my mindset is unfortunately,I always feelI'm 5 feet away from poverty.I'm 5 feet away from being broke.So, I'm debt free.I have zero debt at the age of 43.Because I remember,when I was 21 years old,I had a $1500 credit card debt.That had gone up and with interest,it reached around 6,000-7,000.Had collection agentsknocking on my door every weekand the repossessing my possessions.And I remember,not having enough money to pay rentto buy groceries.And I think that affected my psychology.Where I'm like,I want money in my bank.No matter what,I want liquid cash in my account.Thatâs unfortunately my mindset.So, I should be smarter.But I invest in business ventures.So, recently, I have launched a beerand that took some money.So, I launched my own beer.I'm launching my ownbiscuit company next month.Making biscuits now,or start a comedy company.These things, I like to invest in.But I donât know anythingabout stock market.I donât know anything about Crypto.I don't think,I need to anymore anyway, for crypto.But you know what I am saying.Awesome man.No, no, thatâs fine.I think a great way of investmentis actually putting it in businessesand if you can put your weight behind thatthen why not. Get it.Beaches or mountains?Beaches to live in.Mountains, literally mountains to climb.I'm a climber.I like rock climbing.In the next 5 yearsI will climb some very big mountains,is the plan.Almost figuratively as well?No literally, I will be climbing mountainsin the next 5 years.Iâm scheduled for,Iâm training for the next 2 yearsand Iâll climb some mountainsin the next 5 years.I love that, I love that, I love that.Now that you have travelledso many countries and citiesacross the world.Is there a place outside of Indiathat you would love to settle in,if you had to?Two choices, either Edinburgh, Scotland.Because the climate is good.I like the cold.One such countryside cottage.Something like, two sheeps, two dogs.I could settle myself there.They don't like the British muchlike we don't like the British.So, we get along.Itâs central to the world.Or, Cape Town, South Africa.I grew up in Africa.I grew up in Nigeria.I spend 17 years there.So, I definitelyhave a connection with Africa.So, yeah.Brilliant. Money or power?Neither, art.I think money and powerare both the enemies of art.And what through art?What's the goal through art?To orchestrate an undeniable feelingthat people will remember you for.So, can you create a momentfor an audience member,where they feel they know you completely.And can they go home,maybe not remembering who you areor what you said,but forever rememberinghow you made them feel.I think that's art.I love that. Speed or perfection?Sorry?Speed or perfection?Perfection, I don't think it exists.But I am slowly, as age is getting to me,I'm learning to be a little moreessentialist in my philosophy.And say letâs go, do five thingsbut do it properly.The universe tookeeps appropriately smacking me.Every time I am like,letâs do this project.I it will get done quickly.It never turns out to be a good project.Every time I obsess,and really take my time,it ends up being something good.What's the worst thing about you, Vir?The worst thing about me is.I don't have poise.I donât have the pause.If I have an idea,I have to do that idea tomorrow.I sometimes don't waitfor the universe to join me.So, sometimes you need to say, okay,I want to do thisbut everything will have its time.Put it in the line.Learn how to this thing.But to me the thing I just thought of,is the most exciting thing in my life.And sometimes I need to prioritize.I don't have patience.Any such person in your life,or any relationship there,that keeps reminding you of thisand saying donât be this person.Yeah, my wife Shivaniis very much like,Hey, yesterday you wanted to do this.Now stay on that road.What's wrong with you?And also think the audience.The audience is a very, very good teacher.Yeah.In terms of...If you, like letâs say,If for 5 minutes,I'm going to be doing,I'm writing a new show.I have written maybe 35-40 minutesof new stand-up.So, that in chunks of 5-5 minutes,I will be going to clubsand working it out etc.If I have penned these 5 minutes,and I have not worked it out properly,but I have suddenly writtena brand new 5 minutesI am very excited aboutand you go up on stage with both of them,the audience will let you know,this one is not yet finished.You haven't perfected this one yet.So, you should listento the audience in that sense.Absolutely. Who is the one personthat you listen to?I listen to older comics.I Used to listen my grandfather,my grandfather was a Buddhist leaderand an IAS officer.So, he had a big breadth of experience.So, I used to listen to him quite a bit.My wife and my family will claimI don't listen to thembut little bit gets through.And it gets through after the **** upand in retrospect only it gets through.So, I listen very well in retrospect,is I think how I listen.After the Titanic failed,everyone knew how to save it.Isnât it, yeah.Yeah.Is thereâ¦Is there a part of your day,that is actually undesirable.Like, why do I have to do this,in my life.Post 11:00 a.m.Iâll explain.Please.My day, my is very sorted,in terms of, I am in bedâ¦If I am not doing stand-up,I'm in bed by 9:30-10:00.I'm usually upat 5:00-5:30 in the morning.5:30 to about 5:45-6 o'clockI just walk around in this room.In this study and I think a bit.I have a little,as hippie as it may sound,gratitude ritual.Where I just kind of say, okayhere's what I am thankful for in my life,Nice.Etc, etc.I recheck-in with that.Then 6 o'clock to about 8:00-8:30,I write for 2-1/2 hours every day.That is my peak.So that is, by playing some music.Nobody is allowed to talk to mein the house.I shut my study windowsand I just write for 2-1/2 hoursevery morning.May it be stand-up or be a film,or be whatever, etc.I write every day for 2-1/2 hours.Then, I emerge.Then I am less and less creativethrough the course of the day.So, I hit my creative peakby about 8:30 a.m.and then Iâll have breakfast with Shivani,and usually by 11:00 a.m.the calls and all of that stuff.Then the real world starts to wake upat 11:00 a.m.But I'm bestbefore the real world wakes up.That's a great one.When you writeâ¦Do you also use a pen and paperor is it all digital?It depends, man.I am carrying out an experiment nowYou are the first timeI've looked at my computerin quite a while, actually.I think 6 days ago,I'm on a month-long screen detoxI am sorry for doing this to you.No, not at all.No social media.I check email only once a day.I check WhatsApp only in the evening.And so right now,I am writing with a pen and paper.There is one device called the Freewrite,which is like a Kindle.Which doesn't have any Internet on it.It's just a word processor.So, itâs like a digital typewriter.So, I write on that.But, I also write on stage quite a bit.So, I take the notes and go on the stage.Then that becomes things as well.Thatâs wonderful.Thatâs fantastic.What's the?What's the one. Oh, no, no.Let me ask this question differently.If you had the entire worldlistening to you.For a minute,each person in the world.What would you tell them?If I had the entire worldlistening to me for 1 minute.I would tell them that...There is an unrealistic voice inside them.That voice usually emergeswhen you areâ¦5 minutes before you fall asleep,lying in your bed in the darknesslooking up at the ceiling.That's usually when that voice comes,and 9 times out of 10,at that moment in time,your hatreds have vanished.Your prejudices have gone.Your stresses have gone.And that voice emergesand the entire worldwill spend a lot of timetelling you that voiceis not worth anything.And that voice and that goodnessis the most powerful and worthy partof who you are.That's what I would tell you,to listen to the that voice.I am reflecting upon that.Thatâs beautiful.Very nice.Sorry if that was a little too out thereor anything like that.No, it was good man.It was very good.Not enough people listen to that voice.I so agree with that.I don't think enough peoplespend time with themselveswhich is why we are always hungryto spend time with othersand seek validation in others.Got it, awesome.If there is,have you ever been interestedin running and operating businesses?Do you, do you get that side?Is that energy inducing?I've run businesses before,two of them have succeeded,one of them has failed.I think...Itâs a weird one.If you are an artist.Sometimes you will find yourselfsurrounded by people who are like,Hey you do your thing.Weâll run the business.You write the jokes.Weâll manage the rest.That car is always going to crash.On the highway.I think good artists somehow finda way to infect their businesswith their maddens,with their soul.And I've certainly not learnt that yet.I've ever done it one of two ways,where I'm like,will only operate artistically.And that doesnât work either.Or, I just ply my art,you do the business.And that never works either.I think there is a middle ground,which I havenât learnt yet.Where you can infect your businesswith your madness.Yeah, thatâs so true.Is there a company or an existing businessthat you would like to run?Just to see how that experiencewould be, any.I think,in a weird way,I mean itâs a very bad exampleto take right now.But if you go back 10 years.What Kanye West did with fashion,Itâs very interesting.How he was able to infectmainstream fashionwith artistic maddens,Yeah.I think that's the epitomeof how well that's done.And then of course he burntit all to the ground,but I think,it still stands the test of branding.Ryan Reynoldswith his Aviation Ginis another very, very good exampleof doing the same thing.Where he owned his voicefor a commercial brand.Yeah, yeah.Thatâs actually true, yesA song that you go back to,when you are down about.Like every time, it just works.âAe Ajnabi,â Dil Seis all-time favorite morning songand then I would sayâ¦There's a song called âBaba O'Riley.ââTeenage Wastelandâ by The Who.And that's kind of my,before getting on stage song.Yeah, nice.That brings me to this question.Anything that you have to dolike your ritual before getting on stage.Like, this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 things.Man, itâs very, itâs very fufu.But when I was 35 years old,I lost my voiceand I went to doctor.The doctor was like,for the past 20 years,you've used your voice wrong.And you have nodules on your vocal cords.And he is like, you have to be quite nowfor the next two months.Otherwise, weâll have to do a surgeryon your vocal cords, etc.So, imagine, this my entire shop.Correct.My entire life is thisand I had been neglecting it for so long.So, then he was like, you have to learn,you have to treat your voicelike a muscle.So, if you go to a gym,you need to warm up,then you need to do your work out,then you need to cool down.So, now I have to doa 10-minute vocal warm up.And then after I get off stage,I have to do a 10-minute vocal cool down.So, people think of comedylike had a beer, had a shot,smoked after getting on stage, etc, etc.I am actually in a room,just going maa, maa, maa, maa, maa.Itâs very unglamorousbut that's what I dobefore I go on stageand then, I thinkwhen I'm about to walk on stage,typically, I am stage rightor I am stage left,and there is a momentwhere the lights will go downand the crowd will go insane,you know all of that.I have a ritual where I block that out,I actively choose not to listen to that.I remind myselfthat I have to put the audience firstbecause I think a lot of artistscan get lost in that moment.I certainly did for about 4-5 years,so I actively block that out.Beautiful. Do you read, Vir?Do you read books?I'm dyslexic, man.So, audio booksâ¦Audiobooks are my saving grace.Any one bookthat you would highly recommendeverybody to hear or read.Things you can,âThe Love of Imperfect Thingsâby Haemin Sunim,is a very, very good book.What else did I read?8 by Stephen Kingis my favourite fiction book of all time.What else?I am reading a book called the Nazis.Because I'm obsessed with World War II.But that's a good audio book.So yeah.Yeah, I remembered by World War II,thereâs this book called 1944,if I am not wrong.Thatâs the name of the bookand really highly, highly recommendedon World War IIif you want to get.Yeah, it is.And audio books,if I may make a recommendation.A very great book,'Can't Hurt Me' by David Goggins.Oh yeah, but David Goggins is that,the Joe Rogan guy,the alpha male.Yes, all right, cool. Got it.Unreal story like absolutely wild life,reached from where to where.He is recorded it in his own voiceand heâs a very passionate speakerand of course, he uses cuss wordswith the brilliant impact that it doesso its wonderfully narrated.The highly recommended,one of my best audio books,Iâll give it a try.Because now,I'm in this phase right nowwhere I am training for a filmthat Iâll do maybe September, October,but I'm boxing after a very long time.I used to box in school.So, I'm kind of boxing thrice a weekabout 3 hours a day.Training to box.So, Iâm not an alpha male at all.But these alpha malemotivational speeches that are there,you get some boxing mixes,that you can put in your earswhile you are sparringand they are "life isnât over yet.""Beat the world up,' etc, etc, etc.And it's very powerful.So have been listening to some of themand they remind me of thisDavid Goggins kind of work.Thatâs awesome.All right last 3 questionsbefore we wind up.Yeah.First one.If you could go backto your 20-year-old selfand give that 20-year-old Vira piece of advice.What would you say?Okay, go back to my 20-year-old selfand give him a piece of advice.You already have everything you need.And don't let other peopletake it away from you.Beautiful.Thatâs the advice that I would give.I think a lot of 20-year-oldsconvince themselves,I need this from this guyand that from that guy, etc, etc.Then when you get in the roomswith these very, very big peoplethat you are hoping to get things from,what they really wantis what you already have.Your authenticity or your voice.So, stop trying to adaptto other people's voices.You have what you need, your voice.Beautiful, I love that.What do you thinkwill be the most expensive,since you are such a minimalist,In that sense, what do you thinkwill be the most expensive thingyou will ever buy, Vir?I mean...I mean, I think like aâ¦A writing cottage somewhere.Like a place I go just to write.I think that will bethe most expensive thing I buy.Awesome. Last question.What are you most excited about right now?Any new project,any new thing coming up?Yeah man.So, I haven't acted in a year.Because I spent the last year touring.So, this is an acting year.So, I will do one Indian series.I'll do, I'll star in Hollywood romcom.I will hopefully make an American TV Show.And I'm going to direct a horror movie.So thatâs my year right now.Direct a horror movie!Iâm going to direct a movie.Yeah, yeah.That wasnât a joke in the passing.You mean it.Yeah, no, but by the way,horror and stand-upare exactly the same thing.The timing of a horror movieand the timing of a stand-up comedy showare exactly the same timing.You are trying to getan involuntary reactionfrom people and surprise themaround every corner.So yeah, I'm directing a, not a funny,very scary movie, hopefully.Wow, that is a,thatâs something I'll look forward to.Thatâs brilliant.Thank you so muchfor spending time, man.This was lovely.I got to see a new side of you.Thanks for doing what you are doingand all the best.Keep talking.Thank you, man. Thank you.And I appreciate you being so greatwith all the moving up and downand all of that stuff.No, no, no.Absolutely no problem, at all.Take care, Vir.All the best.Have a lovely day.Cheers. Bye.Bye.
