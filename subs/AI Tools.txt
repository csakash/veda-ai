Imagine that I want to cleanthis image of mine.This image is of my studio,and you can see,I got bored of this silver button.Gold is already here,I might get platinum someday.I want to remove this silver buttonfrom this image,and when I will highlight it,within a few seconds,it will vanish.It's almost as if it was never there.This is not about working in Photoshop.Nothing like that!Simple!It just disappeared!I don't even need this chair here,because I don't like it.So let me remove this as well,clear out the wall, and that's it!This also disappeared.This is the power of AI.The tool I am using is cleanup.pictures.And in this video,I will tell you about allthe AI tools which you can use in 2023to scale your business,do your work quickly and efficiently,and to make money from that.Let's get started.So the first one, as I said,cleanup pictures removeany unwanted object, defect,people, or text from pictures in seconds.As I just showed you,it is an amazing tool.It's so good for graphic designers,or if you are a normal content creatoror a student or a working professional,you have clicked a pictureand you want to use it fora presentation or a project,then this tool can help you clean upyour pictures in secondsusing artificial intelligence.Next is a tool that is very importantfor all of us, especiallyin Indian families.You are on a video call,and in the background,you can hear the pressure cooker,or your mother is screaming,or kids are jumping around,or something just arrived on the door,Amazon or Swiggy, and you are embarrassed.The way to deal with that isthrough this AI tool called Krisp.Through Krisp, with just one click,you can drown outall the background noises.Not just that, you won't be able to hearother people's background noises too,and all you will get to hearis only their voice,and the rest of the peoplewould only hear you.This is the way you can givea professional video interview.No matter where you are,whether a cafe or your houseor even on the road,it will do a great job ofeliminating background noise,and it's free.The next one is a brilliant toolif you are a content creator,for that matter,if you need music in any way.The biggest problem with musicis that it is copyrighted music.And whenever you use copyrighted musicin any YouTube video, your Instagram post,or in a professional outlook,then you are liable for some penalty.This tool Beatoven.ai allows youto generate royalty-free music.You can generate your own music.And the way to do that isyou will pick your genre, your style,then put some cutson whatever segment you would need,you will change its mood,whether you want cheerfulor angry or fast or slow,and then you will actually hit compose,and within a few minutes,your self-composed music will be ready.Wow!Cleanvoice.ai is a boon for podcasters.In your podcast recording,all the filler words like umm or aaa,which happens with everybody,it instantly removes them.Look at how this works.Removing filler sounds and mouth soundsis very time-consuming.Once you put it in the AI tool,it will sound as if you never madeany of those soundsor any of those mistakes.Brilliant tool!Flair.ai is an awesome tool.It will allow you to create professionalhigh-quality high-grade photographsor images of your products.Imagine you are making a product demofor a project,or you do drop shipmenton Amazon or something,then instantly in seconds,you can make a product image,without going throughthe massive expenditurewhich we had to do at some pointto shoot good photographs.Look at the demo.Look at how instantly this shampoo bottlehas translated into a product imagewhich is the power of this tool.You simply have to clicka photo of that image,and everything else will be doneby the AI on your command.Flair.ai.In a lot of presentations and our work,we use vector images.What are vector images?Images that look like these graphics.They are not like the imageswe actually shoot using a camera.And this tool called illustroke.comallows you to generateyour own vector images.So if we type 'old man',and suddenly it will give youall of those options.You can use any of them royalty-free.Whether it is in a common form,artist form, cartoon form,and of course, you can give ityour own command that you wantsomething else instead of 'old man',and all of those at your demand.Illustroke.com.Imagine that you want patternsalong with images,and patterns are very importantto lend a certain emotion.There is a product image,but there is a patternin the background too.As you can see so many patterns here.To generate these patterns yourself,you don't have to take themfrom somewhere or download themfrom Google,you don't have to doa copyright violation,you can generate these patterns yourselfthrough this tool called Patterned AI.As I said, you will describewhat you want as a pattern,and that pattern will be therein front of you within seconds.As we tried to create vector images,we can also generatestock images or photographs.For example, stockimg.ai.You can create book cover, wallpaper,poster, logo, stock image, illustration,art, by giving it a prompt.You can actually say,Ok, book cover, and I want to designa cover that incorporates elementsof the story settingsuch as a landscape or a city skyline,or a castle.And here it is.Wow!This is something that happensjust automatically.This image has never been created.It is artificially generated,it's unique, and every timewhen you give this command,a new image will be created.That is the power of stockimg.ai.This is one of my favorite tools.Copy.ai.Copy.ai can write any content for you,and this is unbelievable.Let's try this.I'll say that I have to writeInstagram captions.Recently added a book tour in Kolkata.There were 600 people,and it was very high energy,so I want to post a video of that.But I don't want to write the captions.So I'll type,caption will beevent at Kolkata where 600 people attendedand were there for 2 plus hours.Friendly, so my tone would be friendly.And let's say,generate content.And then it will createa lot of options for us.Here are the options.Hello! It's Kolkata!The event happened at the New York office.The first one is wrong, but let's see.Event was a success with 600 peoplehaving attended in just 2 plus hours.Thank you for being there!Ok, fair enough.This was an amazing experiencewhere 600 people gathered in Kolkatain a single place.Very nice!Honorable President of India,Shillong Summit.See, this is the beautyand the harm of AI.AI has not done this itself.It has learned from all the contenton the internet,and then generated these things,and somebody must have writtensomething regarding Kolkata,so it came through.Thank you to all the attendeesand speakers who made it.Ok.We had a great time in Kolkata.Ok.It was such a great experience.There were 600 peoplewho were excited to attend this event.Ok.Lots of Smiles and laughterat the Kolkata event.Thanks to all the attendees, speakers,and volunteers.Okay.Great to see so many of you in Kolkatafor our meet-up.Thanks for coming!We had a great time!Now, this sounds like something I can use.So I will copy this.Or I will say,more like this.So I'll write,more like this.And then it will start generatinga lot more options around this as well.The conference was successfullast Thursday.We had a great meeting.We connected with people.And this is how you can generateany content for yourself.Of course,this is just Instagram projects.As I said,you can do product descriptions,write a copy for a Digital ad,write a copy for a website,write a blog, write emails,write captions for social media,write actual articles,and you can also of course use itfor birthday cards or cover lettersor love letters.Interesting!All these things can be donethrough copy.ai.It's an incredibly powerful tool!The more you use it the betterit becomes because it startsunderstanding how things work for you.Incredible!

home furnishingson US or UK Amazon or Australia,or some Indian Products,or some electronic productswhich are cheaper here than there,so this tool allows you to createa product Amazon pageartificially generated.So you will enter the product details,and through that,you will get a complete Amazon page,which you can then uploadto the Amazon marketplace,and get started.Awesome!Next tool is ocaya.comI think I am pronouncing it right.Its ocoya.com.What it does is createsocial media content for you.It is specificallyfor social media content.It can create and schedule your content.So if you want to createInstagram captions,you want to create somethingon Twitter or LinkedIn,it can essentially say,Your content...You can collect many photographs...You can create your first postwhere you will actually go and say,I want to do an Instagram post.It's just like Canva, if you've used it.So I will search for a template.Say, I will pick up this template,I will do my own edits that I want,I will then export it.I will then say, ok,let's try something else.The product is a necklace.We will describe it a little bit,generate the content,and this one looks okay,so we'll add the content to the caption.Then we will be able to take outthe trending hashtags.And then once you are done,here is your entire post.This is exactly how it is.And if you would have linked your profile,then it would instantly schedule itas per your date,and you would be ready to post.That's literally as easy as that.So click click click,and your post has been scheduled,This of course works really wellfor personal
