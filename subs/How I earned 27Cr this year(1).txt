Last year, in December 2021,I made a really difficult video.Maybe the hardest video in my content careerand that was about how muchmoney I earned in 2021.This video was difficult for mebecause I didnât want this videoto look like a show off.Like look at the enormousamount of money that I madeand how I am drowning in it.No. It was more about inspirationthat if I can do it,at the age of 40,even with 2 kids, if I am ready to restart my lifefrom scratchthen what is stopping youat the age of 20, 25, 30 to start your life all over again,and if I can do it,who is not the smartest person,not the most hardworking person,I donât have any special talent thatdistinguishes you and me, then you have every single thingto reach this point in lifewhere I am today. Maybe you can go even higher.And to make this video, I used the same modebut with a lot more transparencyand admittingly,a lot more comfort.Earlier, I was scaredNow, I am not scared because all of youreceived that video so beautifully.So many people wrote to me sayingthat after watching the video, they only felt inspiration. So, in a way,I was reassured and thatâs why this video for 2022, and in this video,I will share all thenumbers from 2021 videowhich I muted.If you havenât watched that video then you can watch it now.All the numbers of all incomestreams were not shared in the video. I only shared a total amountthat from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021, I earned 12 crore rupeesand this year, that number is 27 crore rupees, but the split of the 27 croreand the same numbers of 2021will be discussed in this video.Number 1 income stream. Ad revenue.Every YouTube creatoruses ads forIf you create content on YouTubethen you can turn on monetization,meaning you can give permission to ads,and earn ad revenue.This is something that isturned off on my channel and it has an emotional reason.I feel that our entire YouTube journeyis because of all of you.I had no businessin reaching this destination.I started so late.I am not an expert.I donât know somethingthat a lot people donât know.There have been somany legends before mewho are experts,have been creating content on YouTube for yearsabout personal finance,about career, about books.So, all the success that I have had,at least I cannot explain it.I only have one explanation that because of all of you,because of your attention,because of your love,I am here today.So, through you, I donât want to earn money.Showing you ads on my channeland filling my pocketis not something I want.You can call it emotional.You can call it hypocriticalbecause I have my own ads.You might be boredafter watching my adsand praying for the day to comewhen you donât seemy ads on YouTubebut I reassure myself by saying that I show my ads on those channelswhich readily like and accept my ads,which donât have any problemin showing my adsand they show ads to their audience,and through that,I run my ads businesswhich generate coursesand I will talk about thatin a separate stream.So, in 2021, through ads,we earned around 35,000 rupees.No, actually I will show it through Loom. So, in 2021, through ads,we earned around 35,425 rupees.How did this happen? Because I forgot that when you go live on YouTube, there is a feature called Super Chatwhich is monetizablebut I didnât turn that off.So, whenever we went live,people would pay money to bring their chats upand that generated this amountwhich was 35,000 rupees, and we realized this a little late.So, in 2022, aroundFebruary or Januaryand we turned that off as well.So, 7625 rupees and 6 paisewe earned in 2022 through ad revenue.There is no ad revenue from YouTube,not from Twitter, not from LinkedIn,not from any other platform as well,my podcast doesnât earn ad revenueand so on.So, this was theonly ad revenue streamfor the year 2022.7625 rupeeswhich was 35,000 last year.Second income stream isAffiliate Income.What is affiliate income?Affiliate income is whenever, whereveron social media, I share a link which is not of my website but some other destination,it could be Amazon,it could be INDmoney, it could be Zerodha,it could be Smallcase, it could be Udemy.So, through that link,if you go to their platform or website or appand make a purchase then I get a share ofthat transaction revenue.This is called affiliate income.Now, because my following has reached a level where a lot of people consume my content.So, wheneverI share any linkand people click on itand make purchasesand that generates an income.To show you how it works,this is a pinned commentof a YouTube video released from my channel whereI show my money apps like Zerodha, INDmoney, smallcase,my gear for shooting,whatever I have bought and all of these are Amazon links.So, if you click and you gothen you will actually come on Amazonand you will see that the URL has a tag,AnkurWarikoo21,which tells me that if youbuy that camera,which you canât right nowbecause itâs not available, but if you buy itthen I will get a percentageof the salesthat is generated.So, I have 4So, I have 4 affiliate partners.Amazon,Udemy,Zerodha, and Policybazaarand their total sum in 2021was 26 lakh rupees.In 2022, from Jan to December, this amount has become60,63,496 rupees.That means almost, almost 2.5 times more.The best thing aboutthis affiliate incomeis 100% of this money is given out.There are a lot of peoplewho canât afford their educationand education is a really important thing for me.So, for all those kids, their school or college fees, I pay all that through this income. Last year,Last year, the 26 lakh rupeeswere used to sponsor education for 53 students.This year, I donât know that number but out of the 60 lakhs,46 lakhs has already been spent.So, I am super happyand actually thankful to youbecause through your efforts,all these kids are able to study.Right now, I cannot fund international educationbecause that is very expensive but in India,wherever it is,if it is an engineering degreeor a college degreeor school fees, all of thatis something that I amvery, very happy to doand so many beautiful storiesare born out of themwhere students who are intelligent, who are capablebut unfortunately,who canât afford the fees,through your help,make that happen.So, I am super thankful to all of you.Number 3,and this was a surprise entry this year.Not a surprise but a new entrythis year which is royalty from book sales.When you write a bookthen for every book sale,you get a royalty.That is usually around 8-12% and this is dependent onwhether it is paperback or hardcover, so on and so forth.So, itâs not much.My book, âDo Epic Shitâwhich was released in December 2021.So, it got the entire period of 2022. It had a retail of Rs. 399.So, for every sale, then I get between 30-50 rupees,and I thought how much will it be? But that is where I was shocked. In 2021,this entire amount was zero.I didnât get any royalty because I hadnât written a book, and in 2022, through royalty,I earned 1,03,12,362 rupees.When I got to know this,I was just pinching myselfbecause I canât even believe that this is happening. There was a time whenwriting a book was a dream.A goal of sorts thatmight not be possible in life.Now, it is a pointwhere this book hasnât just been written, printed, bought by people,appreciated by peopleand appreciated it so muchthat it has generatedthis royalty amount.1 crore rupees in royalty.Thank you again so much.Number 4.Corporate talks and sessions.This is somethingthat I started in 2019.Before that, all the corporate talksthat I did or the sessionsthat I attended, I did them for free because I wanted to practiceand get better at it andI did that for almost 3-4 years,but in 2019, with time, I started monetizing it.In 2021, due to covid, there were many virtual sessionsbut in 2022, as soon asthe world startedgetting back to normal,corporate people went berserk.The were likeso many people have come to offices.They have to be motivated.They have to be inspired.There were a lot of competitionsso I was invited as a judge to evaluate them,give feedbacks,and mentor them.So, all of that began to happen. In 2021, through corporate talks and sessions, I earned 54,12,893 rupees, which in 2022became 2,03,13,818 rupees.It is a wild amount but this should tell you the potential that it has.This is not about content creation.It is not about you being on a camera.These are the things that your personal brandand your trustand your experienceand yourstatus are accepted and appreciated by peopleand it turns into actualmoney at the end of it.So, if you are a creator or an entrepreneuror a performer,ultimately if you do itwith theSo, if you are a creator or an entrepreneuror a performeror an artist,with pure dedication,if you work hardand practice for years and become a master in your skillthen one day, people willappreciate you and that is when you unlock this value.Then number 5,and these are brand collaborations.So, whether on YouTube,on LinkedIn,on Instagram,on Twitteror anywhere else,if I collaborate with brandsand promote their productsand their services then I earn money through that as well.I have some principles for this. Number 1.I will work only with those brands that I personally use as a consumerbecause through that, I will knowhow this experience isand should it be even recommended to somebody else or a productwhose founder is someone I knowand I have known for years.So, there are a lot of startupswhere I would work with them but because I know their founders or I use their productsand I am happy with that. Number 2.If that product is a financial product then my own moneymust be invested in it,not as an investorbut making my money through that.So, if it is smallcase then my personal money is invested in smallcase, not smallcase: the company but smallcases.If it is INDmoneythen my own money is invested in thatand in US stocks. If it is Vauld then my own moneyis invested in it in crypto.If it is WazirXthen my own money is invested in it in crypto.If it is anything else likeWint Wealth or Udemy,I have, as a consumer,used my money to buy their products and their services and that is my way of saying that if I can bet on thiswith my moneyor I am ready to usethis product or service,that gives me the comfort that in front of everyone else,without hesitation,with full honesty and integrity,I can share it.That is what I do. This is a really big space.Influencer marketingand all these personal brands. It is wildand I didnât know that it could be this big but clearly, it is very big. In the year 2021, Jan to December, through brand collaboration,I earned 5,48,61,779 rupees.So, almost 5.5 crores.In 2022, Jan to December,this amount became 10,58,83,615 rupees,meaning almost 10.5 crores,which is a crazy numberbut this shows that how as this flywheel starts buildingand with authenticity,with trust,with pure honesty,when you work on it,brands love to then align with you and make it happen.A lot of good brands are therethat I work withand I am proud to work with them. A lot of brands are there,a lot of very, very good brandsthat I work withand after using theirproducts personally, I am so happy that it just becomes an honourfor them to also saythat will you take our product, our brand,our serviceto the worldthrough your content? Thank you for that.And then finally,the ads that have bored you to death. So, my startup,which is outside ofmy content creation journey,is an education startup. I am a teacher by professionand I love to teach. That is why I speak slowly andask people to watchmy videos at 1.5x speedbecause I try to explain things calmly and slowly and for me,all of you are my students.People, irrespective of age,who are happy to learn,willing to learn andare curious to learn.So, I have started my education companywhere I conduct online courses.These online coursesare about those subjectswhich were beneficial for meor I learnt somethingthat I can share with all of you.The first course that I launched was about startups because since the last 12 years, I have been running startupsand I knewwhat all goes behind the scenesthat people donât talk about.So, I made a startup course thatis very honest,a 16-hour course.Then time management,because time management,I believe, is my superpower.I manage my time,keep it under control so efficiently that I felt that this is something that I shouldthat I felt this is somethingthat I shouldteach peopleand thankfully, that has become abig course in itself.A course on public speaking is there,a course on YouTube is there,we are launching acourse on communication,we will launch a course on Instagram,we will launch a course onpersonal writing and creative writing,we will launch a courseon personal finance.So, all these courses will be therewhich are very low priced.So, the courses are not expensive.Like the time management course is maybe for Rs. 399 or Rs. 699,the startup course is for Rs. 1,499, the YouTube course which is25-hour long course is only for 2000 rupees.So, all of these add a lot of value,come with a full refund policyand of course,to promote these courses, I use ads a lot and the way that it works is whenever you put 1 rupee in adthen how much will you earn out of it?And my focus is thatwhenever I put 1 rupeethen I should earn at least 1.5 rupee,ideally 2 rupees,which means a profit ofat least 50%and ideally 100%on the ad spend. So, that makes itprofitable from day 1and it is. In 2021, I sold courses worth 5,84,86,556 rupeesand in 2022, Jan to December,this has become12,97,74,032 rupees,which means almost 13 crore rupeesin courses.These courses are almostat a run rate of 1.5 crore months. Slowly and steadily, they have come to 1.5 croreand I am very surethat this will keep rising as we add new courses.But when you do the math, in 2021, all these income streams, ad revenue,affiliate,royalty which was not there,talks and sessions,brand collaborationsand courses included, I earned a total of12 crore 13 lakh rupees.Sorry, I didnât.My company did.And in 2022, these 6 income streams included, we earned, as a company,a total of 27 crore 23 lakh rupees.A crazy 124% jump on last year.The best thing isthis is immensely profitablebecause the biggest expense isthe ad spend and that isprofitable in the first place itself.There are salariesof a really small and amazing team.Every one works hard. It is completely remote,so no office expenses.We meet every 3 months on an offsite.So, we spend heavily,we stay in great hotels,we eat great food,we distribute the money very wellso there is profitsharing for the team,where all this profitearned on the 27 crore revenue basegoes back to the team,and all of this just makes for awonderful experience where we enjoy working with people,we enjoy creating good content,we enjoy helping people through coursesand we enjoy a good nightâs sleep because we have done all this in a waywhere we respect people,we value themand we genuinely want to help them,and I will end this videowith that same message that in this world,earning moneyseems difficult but it is easy.As you grow up,maybe you are in your 20s andyou feel that money is important,and it is very important, but earing moneyis an art that you will learn with timeand whether you earn it from your job or from your investmentsor from your business,all of that will becomeeasier and easier.But the true question to ask is, when you have earned the money,what will you use it for?What will you spend that money on? And if you donât know that thingor doing that thingdoes not bring you happiness then that money is useless. It does not have any value. It does not have any respect.And I feel really proud saying thisthat however much moneythis company earns,I earn as a salary,my wife earns,we use it only for 2 things.For our own happiness.We eat good.We spend well on our health. We spend well on our learning.We spend on our experiences, our travel.We spend on the education of our kids.We spend on our own education.We live in a good place.But after that,the second is only to help people.There was no reason thatthe 60 lakhs of affiliate income should have been used to help people.There is no reasonfor profit sharing among my team.There is no reason thatan intern in my team whois 18 or 19 or 20 year old, she is earing 10 lakhs per annumfor doing something that she does. But I love doing thisbecause that is thereal meaning of money for me.To make you happy and to help others,and if you can tie your moneywith an objective thatmakes you happythen that money will be the best money that you will everearn in your life.And I hope that 2023 is that year for youthat whatever you earn, you should spend it in a way that you get a good nightâs sleepknowing thatyou respected this moneythe best you couldwhile spending it in the right way.
