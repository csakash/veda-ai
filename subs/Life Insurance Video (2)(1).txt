What is term insurance?What maturity benefits plans?Weâll get to know all of it in this video.Friends, welcome to theâComplete Guide To Buying Insuranceâ,it is a 6-part series which I have launchedto understand each minute detail aboutinsurance in association with policybazaar.comas my knowledge partner.For this video I have chosen life insuranceas the topic. According to me, life insuranceis an insurance product which you shouldabsolutely buy before making any investment,because it is an insurance product for your family,in the event if something happens toyou as the earning member.Weâll try to understand 3-4 things in this video.First of all, what is life insuranceand why is it important?Second, what the basic parts of life insurancewhich are important for you toknow before you buy one?Third, what is term insurance andmaturity benefits plans?And then fourth, how can you buylife insurance? which we will seeon the site of policybazaar.comFirst of all, letâs start with, why islife insurance important?The way I explained in the first episode,life insurance basically works on thebasic formula of insurance which isif âXâ happens then give me financial protection.In life insurance, âXâ is death.If I am buying a life insurance and I am theearning member in the family, and my spouse,kids and parents depend upon me,suddenly if I die then they are still leftwith all the expenses, monthly expensesare still there, they also have to pair all theloans which will be outstanding at that time,so suddenly without any income theywill be burdened with lot of expenses.And you donât want that at that time theyshould search for a new job or makearrangements of money from anywherewhich may not be possible at that time.That is why you insure yourself.And you say, if âXâ happens, which in this caseis death, then give my family financial protection.Now, how does this work?Usually, in case of life insurance,at some appropriate age you buylife insurance, and you buy it fora term or for a duration.In my opinion, 20âs is the best time tobuy insurance, and I will explain why.And you should buy your insurancetill your retirement age.So, letâs say you are of 25 years oldand you will retire at 65, so then youcan buy a 40-year life insurance plan.Which will mean that you will pay apremium to the insurance companyevery year, which will be a fixed amount.I will also explain its benefits andwhy is it a good thing that youpay a fixed amount.And then at the end of the term,either you will get something in caseyou have a maturity benefit orendowment plan or you may not getanything in case you have a term plan.Now letâs try to understand what is aterm plan, maturity benefitor an endowment plan.Term plan may seem to be a childishor a random kind of product but in myopinion, it is the most powerful product.Let me tell you why does it seem random.Term plan says that, when you buylife insurance: letâs again consider youbuy it at the age of 25 and you buyit up to the age of 65 years.Which means you buy a term plan for40 years, so every year you pay a premiumto the insurance company to giveyou a cover for your death.Which means, God forbid if somethinghappens to you then to your family,whomsoever you decide as a nominee,which could be your spouse or could beyour parents, they will get thatamount that you have insured.But!! During these 40 years if nothinghappens to you, which we would all love, right?God willing nothing happens to you fora very long life, then you arenot going to get anything.Nothing at all at the age of 65.When you would have been payinga premium to the insurance companyfor a period of 40 years, at the end of ityou will get no benefit, in case noadverse thing that happens to you.So that is why it seems to be a veryrandom type of product, why wouldsomebody take it? Like why wouldanyone in their right mind pay aninsurance company a premium for 40 years,and after that I would of course,wish nothing happens to me andif nothing happens then I wonâtget anything at all.The reason why term insurance isa good product to consider is becausethe insurance company doesnât haveto pay you back or they donât have toreturn you the premium, or they donâthave to generate a return,they offer the maximum coverfor lowest premium possible.Which means at a very nominal amountyou can get maximum insurance.How much cover should you take?Letâs discuss about it.Usually if your salary is x annually,then according to me the minimum cover shouldbe 10 times of it, so that your nomineewould get a lumpsum of 10 years of yoursalary in one go. According to me ideal covershould be 20 times, so if your salary isâ¹5,00,000 annually, then the minimumcover should be â¹50,00,000 and ideallycover should be â¹1,00,00,000, which meansGod forbid, if something happens to you,then your family would get â¹50,00,000 orâ¹1,00,00,000 or whatever amountyou would have decided.Its best benefit is that the amountor the premium is fixed for the entireduration. You must have heard aboutinflation and you also must knowthat due to inflation the value of ourmoney keeps reducing every year, whichmeans that, letâs say for this premiumof â¹1,00,00,000, you are paying apremium of â¹5-6-10,000 every year,then its value every year will keep reducing.Which means after 40 years, when youwould be paying â¹10,000 annually,frankly that â¹10,000 will have no value,you would give it away just like that.Yes, today these â¹10,000 seem a lot,but the best thing about insurance is that,it is a fixed premium product,and that means you find it difficultright now, but in future that difficultywill reduce only, not increase.This is a great benefit for buyinga term insurance plan.Second benefit is that all the amountthat you pay as a premium, it applies inyour deductions under section 80C.I have made a video on income tax,watch it. I have discussed aboutsection 80C in it, which deducts anamount from your total income,which is the premium amount you pay,and because of that your taxable incomereduces considerably. So, the secondbenefit of buying insurance, is thatyou get deductions because of whichyou pay less tax. This is a wayfor the government to encouragepeople to buy insurance.Endowment plan on the other handare plans which say, that you keeppaying premium for some term or duration,and then after that, we will give youa return. That return could be givingback your premium, or may keep gettinga monthly income for some years,or you keep getting a lumpsum amountfor some years or quarters,and so on and so forth. There are manyother ways for this endowment planto work, but the biggest thing thatyou need to recognize is that, you arebasically putting a responsibility onthe insurance company that whateverpremium you are paying them,they have to generate a return on it.So, you are not buying an insurance product,but an investment product, and this ismy personal recommendation, this isnot something that you should takeat face value. Please do your research,I am not an expert. But my personalrecommendation Is that the premiumyou will pay them, and the return thatthey will generate on it, you can dothat yourself if you were to invest directly.But the biggest disadvantage of theseendowment plans or these maturitybenefit plans is that you have to paya far bigger premium for the same cover.So, the cover of â¹1,00,00,000 thatyou can get in â¹5-6,000, if you takethe same cover of â¹1,00,00,000 in abenefit plan, then you may have topay a premium of â¹20-25,000.This amount can increase 2-3-4 times.Why would you want to do that?Only because you are getting acomfort of a return, but as I said,if you are a wise investor or a wiseprincipled finance person,then you can generate that returnfrom somewhere else as well.Pause, sweat! Shivam! I have switchedoff the AC in this room and the roomis warm, so I have to do with breaks.Next, letâs discuss that while buyingterm insurance or endowment plan,what are the considerations that youshould keep in mind. Always rememberthat you are taking a life insurance product,which means you are insuring your life,so everything that you considerhas to be according to that.Firstly, if the income is stopped dueto your death, that is of course theobvious thing, but it is possible thatyour income stops because 2-3 otherreasons. God forbid, you get a criticalillness and because of that you cannotwork anymore, or God forbid youmeet an accident or have a disability,because of which you cannot work,so you have to take these intoconsideration as well. These arecalled add-ons. Add-ons are thethings which you can add on thecore insurance product. The 2 mostimportant that I would ask you to consider is,Number 1, critical illness add-on,which means if you get a critical illnessduring this term, then you arecovered for that as well.And second is, disability add-on,which means if you are disabled inany way, and you cannot earn anymorebecause of that, then you will get acover or benefit for that too.In addition to this, there are 2 moreadd-ons, that if you get a critical illness,then after that you do not have to paythe premium, insurance company willgive that premium to you now or sorry,wonât give it you but on your behalf,they will recognize that premium.So, this is a good one because dueto critical illness, you are unable toearn anymore but premium needs tobe paid, so if you take this add-on thenthat premium also gets waived off.Same thing for disability, if you get adisability and you arenât able to earnbecause of it, then you will get a coverfor sure, but along with it thepremium will also be waived offthrough this add-on.So, these 4 add-ons: Critical illness, Disability,Premium waiver on critical illness andPremium waiver on disability.According to me, these 4 are importantmandatory add-ons, that you should considerwhile considering life insurance in general.And finally, which life insurance should you buy?There are so many products in the market,Max, HDFC, this and that, I have forgottenthe names as well, weâll see in a while.So, according to me, 2 considerationsare very important.Number 1, of course a reputed brand. Why?Because you are buying a life insurance,then by design, by nature, itâs a longduration product, so naturally youwant to be comfortable that this company,this brand, will stay for that duration.So, you obviously bet on brands whichyou trust and you trust immensely.Second, a very important considerationin life insurance is something calledclaims ratio. Which means if 100 claimsare made, claim means someone hasdied or they are claiming the cover amountthat they had insured from the insurancecompany, so what percentage of thoseclaims are actually paid out. Itâs never 100%,because people try to fraud in manythings or it is established that the claimdidnât happen because insurance companygot to know of something, letâs say youwere already ailing, but you did notdisclose it to the insurance companyand because of that unfortunatelyyou died, after that when the claimhappens then the insurance companyfigures it out that you did not disclosean existing illness, then it is quite possiblethat they will not settle that claim oryour nominee will not receiveyour covered amount.These could be legitimate reasons butit is important to know that, what isthe claim ratio of that company or brand.The higher it is, the better it is,because that then allows you to havethat comfort, that if somethinghappens to me, then my family will nothave to run around to get thisamount in their bank.Another thing is that wheneveryou take life insurance, then pleasedisclose everything that you should a 100%.It is life insurance and you do not want,like I just explained, that if somethinghappens to you then your family hasto run from pillar to post to get this amount.This should be something that theyget easily and that is possible onlywhen you have cleanly and transparentlydisclosed everything, whether its illness,whether itâs the fact that you smoke or youhave a certain lifestyle, so on and so forth.Please do not hide anything, because ifyou do and then it comes out in the open,then it may make things complicatedFinal things, it is better to buy life insuranceas soon as possible. As I said, the rightage to buy life insurance is within your 20s.If you take it too early, then maybeyour income will not be that much thatyou can take a good cover,and if you take it too late then premiumwould become higher, because youhave reached a certain age, and thatnaturally increases the chances of death.So, according to me, the right ageis between 25-35 years. If you buylife insurance between the age of 25-35,whether term or endowment plan,that will give you the best combinationof a good cover, because your salarywould be good enough to cover the20 times of it, and also the right premium,because it wonât be very expensive.Letâs try and see now how this actually works.For that, I will visit policybazaar.comand I will show you how it works.Ok, policybazaar.com, term insurance.So, I am on term insurance on policybazaar.com.You can see the headline, life cover of1 crore, as low as â¹490/month or â¹6000/year,which is the ballpark if you are at thatright age, but letâs see how this works.Male, my name is Shahrukh Khan,my date of birth is 1st January 1995,so I am 26 years old, I have entered anumber, and now when I click, I willget the quotes. There will be somequestions, which as I said, pleaseanswer them clearly and honestly.Do you smoke or chew tobacco? No, in my case.What is your annual income?Let me just use 5-7 lakhs.Are you salaried? YesWhat is your educational qualification?I am a college graduate and above.And then you have the results shown, got it.So, this is how it works.Firstly, they will show how much is thelife cover. I want to take a life cover of1 crore, and I also want that this coversme till 65 years of age. When you do this,you will then see, by the way this is themonthly amount, if you want to getannual amount, you can do that too,it shows annually â¹14,000 if I takeICICI Prudential plan, and it also has a lotof things that are covered, I will tell youall that. First of all, what I will do is,I will sort them by âclaims settledâ,like I said, this is claims ratio, whichmeans MaxLife, these are notrecommendation, so please donât goby this, but what it says is, if MaxLifegot 100 claims, then 99.4 claims gotpaid out, as against TataAIA, where outof 100 claims, 99.1 claims were processed.And it also has these add-ons. Like I said,these add-ons are,Critical illness benefit: in case thepolicy holder is diagnosed with specific illnesses,covered amount will be paid out.How much cover amount do you want?Letâs say I want â¹30 lakhs, which meansGod forbid, if I get a critical illness, in thisterm which is 26 to all the way to 65,then I will get â¹30 lakhs.Accidental death benefit: in caseof death due to accident, an additionalcover amount will be paid to the nominee.So, they will get your cover of â¹1 crore,and they will some extra money too,I think â¹10 lakhs is fine, so I will put that.Accidental disability benefit: in case ofdisability due to accident, an additionalcover amount will be paid out. Again, if youget accidental disability, then they willreceive the cover and over andabove that additional â¹10 lakhs.If I do that, then it has this entireoption laid out. Itâs also mentionedhere that, rider premium cannot bemore than claim premium, please note that,which is fine, that is ok.So, if I take Max then it is 9,802.HDFC is 25,000, TataAIA is 19,000,KotakLife is 16,000, this looks like a great amount.If I click on this, then 99.4% claim ratio.They will ask you for all the details.This is absolutely clear, all these things,you are taking a cover of 1 crore till theage of 65, which means for 39 years,you will pay this amount of 10,540 annually,because that is what you have to pay.As I said, this amount would seemdifficult for a few years but after that it willbecome something which is very very normal.If you go back and this is something thatI want to show you, there are 2-3other things that can be there.Plans that return my premium, these arethe endowment plans about which Iwas talking, meaning, âI have paid thepremium, but I do not feel good aboutthe fact that all the money is going thereand I of course donât want anything tohappen to me, but if nothing happens,then this whole money will just gothere and I will not get anythingâ,so if I click on this, then suddenlyyou will see, it will become insanelyexpensive. The plan which was forâ¹9,000, it is now for â¹15,000 annually.And you will, of course if you click here,you will see all the benefits that come,whatever it has, but you have to now payâ¹16,000 or whatever is itsamount, to get this done.If you go back, then the other piece,which is also equally important is that,letâs say your salary right now is â¹5 lakhsbut you know that in 10 years your salarywould be â¹10 lakhs, so you will be ableto take a higher cover. So, you go withplans which increase the life cover,or give you the option of increasingthe life cover. Life cover and premiumare fixed, so if you have taken a coverof â¹1 crore at 25 years and you are payinga premium of â¹9,000 only and you willhave to pay it for next 40 years,but if you want to change this cover ofâ¹1 crore to â¹5 crores, then these arethe plans that allow you to do that atany point of time within the term.So, you can raise your coverthrough this approach as well.Then you have the add-ons, sorry,not this, I am done with this.And finally, you can always comparethe plans. So, if you click on âcompare plansâ,letâs say I want to compare these 2 plans;I will be able to see every detail that is there.How much is the premium?What is the max coverage?So, you can take a life insurance for100 years, for instance on TataAIA,which is great because, well I shouldnâtsay it, but till 100 years, almost 100%,no not 100%, but most of the peoplewould die, which means in some wayyou are saying that, unfortunatelywhenever I die, then my nominee willget this amount. In a way, itâs aguaranteed pay-out.Then, what is the claim settlement ratio?What is the average claim trend?Which means what is the average claim ratiofor last 3 years as against the averageclaim ratio for the whole time.If you want to take it on a return ofpremium plan, then instead of 9,000,it will be for 14,000. Instead of 10,000,you will pay 18,000, so on and so forth.There are many things. Inception,when did it start? What is the solvency ratio?Which means how much money dothey have, which is some way tell youthat when they have to pay-out,then they donât run out of their own funds.The higher the ratio, the better it is,so on and so forth. There are manysuch details that you can explore.Policybazaar is a great way for youto compare but essentially life insuranceis a good product for you to start with.Till the time you do not have thisinsurance product, my recommendationwould be that you do not start anyinvestments. First drive your monthlyor yearly income towards buying thisinsurance, you will get tax benefitsunder 80C, and most importantly,you will protect your family, in the caseof death which will be untimely, but if ithappens you have to be ready for that.I hope this was useful.In the next episode, we will discusshealth insurance for your parents,which is a big decision, because theyare old and aged, maybe illnesses havestarted cropping in, so it is importantthat the health insurance you selectfor them would be different from yourand your familyâs health insurance.It will be, how and why and what arethe considerations, we will get to knowall of that in the next episode ofâComplete Guide To Buying Insuranceâ,with policybazaar as the knowledge partner.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
