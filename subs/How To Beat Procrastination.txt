Check 1, 2. Check1, 2.The worst thing aboutprocrastination is not that youare unable to complete work on timeor you do not start work on time.The worst thing about it isthat because we do notstart work on time,we become trappedin guilt. Wethink that therehas been a mistake with us,there is some fault in us,we won't be able to do it,and we ourselves keepfighting with this.And that leadsto a paralysis.Paralysis of thought,of action,of mind and of confidence.In this video, I will try toshare those techniques whichteach you how to dealwith procrastination.In this video, how to deal withprocrastination, which techniquesIn this video,we will try to understandhow to deal with procrastination,the different tips and tricksand techniques which you can use todeal with procrastination,so that youdo not remainin this guilt.Firstly, before starting,it is very important to know thatthat procrastination isnot a character flaw.If you procrastinate, whichis something many people do,there is no fault in you.It is not that youare a bad person, that youdon't want to work hard.It is somethingwhich can be changed,it is something thatcan be improved upon.It becomes your responsibilitythat you do not always stayin this guilt, this pressure,this performance anxietyand relieve yourselfthrough this entire process.And due to this,it is important to know howto deal with procrastination.or how to understand it.But it's important to recognizethat this is not yourmistake, this is a choicethat you can exerciseto not fallin the trap of.First let's start withfew tips and tricks.Easy things which you canuse in your life to beatprocrastination or atleast handle itso that youdo not feel paralyzed.My favourite is -The Pomodoro Principle.Pomodoro technique,not a principle, it is a technique,Pomodoro techniqueis a 30-minuteslot, where you work for 25 minutes,take a 5 minutes break,work for 25 minutes again,take a 5 minutes break,then again 25 minutes, then 5, 25and then again 5. After4 such pomodoros, you takea long 30 minutes break and againrepeat 4 pomodoros.Why does it work?Number 1 - you anticipatethat 5 minute breakso you know that after thehard work for 25 minutes,after this work, you willget that 5 minutes break,and that anticipation makesus focus during the 25 minutes.This is proven, by the way,that Pomodoro technique worksand works immensely wellto get someone to focus.There are many appswhich give you the Pomodorotechnique for free. So the25 minutes timer will run, thenan alarm will ring and then the5 minutes break timer willring and the alarm will ring.So you can actually track that andbe a pomodoro ninjawhen it comes to work.The second one - a great technique -it's called The 2 MinuteRule. Our mindprocrastinates because we thinkthere is so much work,where do we start from,we will do it later. Wethink that there's yet time left.But this 2-minute rulemakes many tasks easy.If any workcan be done in or within 2 minutes,which does not include making Maggi,that is a lie,then you do it at that time itself.Do not postpone it.And here's a scientific reason why -our mind does not remembercompleted tasks,rather it remembersincomplete tasks.I will say that once more - if ourmind has to rememberany thing,it will mostly rememberthose things which havenot yet ended, as againstthose things whichhave ended. This is the reasonoften when we go for a vacation,or a movie, we forget about it.We feel likewe just wentand forgot about it also.But we yet remember some thing thatwe had started andhave not yet completed.That'sThat's because our mindis structured that way.So if youkeep giving your mind a to-do list,containing too many tasks,then your mind will dominate over you.And it willwant to procrastinatebecause it will feel likethere's so much workto start these tasks,we will do it later.So the 2-minute rule isthat whatever work can bedone in or within 2 minutes,and you can make this 5 minutesas well, you set your own rule,but not more than 5 minutes.Any task which can be done in orwithin 2 minutes or 5 minutes,do it at that time itself, don'tpush it to another time,another day.Number 3 -visualization.VisualizationVisualizationVisualizationVisualizationis a techniquein which youmake a map.How many of you'll use Google Maps?I am assuming many people must be.Maybe you already knowthe way to that place,but yet when yousee that road on Google Maps,it tells you the time,you feel a kind of peace.I definitely feel it.Because one kind ofpredictability comes inthat we know it's going to be crowded,we know it will take 30 minutes,we know that we willreach the right place.This is the purpose of map.The map is not onlyto tell you where to go,it also tells youthat while going,what are the thingsyou have to expect.And what is the nature of that.So for any kind of work,if you see its end result, you willfeel like it is a lot.If you have to make a presentation,you have to start preparing foran exam after 2 years,or you have to preparefor an interview,or after 5 years, youforget everything, you arenot starting investing money,you are procrastinating, why?Because you feel likethat money will givereturns after 5 years,so why should I?The end goal always feels likeit is very big,it seems like a very big monster.So why even bother?But if that same monster,that big goal,is distributed intosmall maps,you begin to visualizethe journey. And that'swhat you have to do.So it's almost like, whenever Istart ona big goal, I literally make a mapcontaining steps includingwhere we will start from,how we will move, exactly the same waywith a process as well.For example, we are making a course.The first step tomake a course will bethat we decide thename of the course.Step 2 would be to decide thetarget audience for that course.For step 3, we willdecide the difficultiesin the lives of the target audiencefor which they will want this course.Step 4 would be to find what are thethings they would appreciateto solve those difficulties.Step 5 would behow we can teach those things.What will be the flow?Step 6 would be how we make thatflow a 8-week or 2-week program.The next step -who can teach all this?So there are small parts likemodule 1, module 2, module 3.Then deciding how theinstructor will teach -through PPTs or projectsor demos or assignments?So you get the drift?This is for making a course. But ifI directly think that Ihave to make a courseto teach someone YouTube,it seems so big.But when you visualize this intosmall steps and break it down,you make it easieron yourself and beatprocrastination.Number 4 - time blocking.Proven technique to work.Block your time.Our mindistuned to operate around deadlines.What is the most fundamentalrealization of procrastination?That Ikeep procrastinatingone week's work,and I keep procrastinating,and on the last day,I do the entire week'swork in one go.How does it work?Becausethere is a deadline.There is an imposition.There is a limitbeyond which I cannotprocrastinate.Set the same thingfor your life. So what is time block?Time block is an exercise whereTime block is aan exercise in whichyou block your timeand state that before this time ends,I will definitely completethis work.Because thatis myprocrastination limit.I cannot procrastinate beyond this,for this small task,I definitely cannot do it.Now if you have done thevisualization piece discussed before,then this is very effective.Because visualizationplus time blockingworks like magic. Youhave broken the entirething in small pieces,and now you are time blockingthose small pieces andyou are trying to check them.So it suddenly makesyou immensely productivewhile neverprocrastinating.And fifth - it always works -accountability.Go back towhy you do that workon the last day.Because many people say,"Ankur,time blocking is nice.But we have to do it with ourselves.We will convince ourselves.We can easily lie to ourselves.We will make some excuse.And it will go to waste."That is where you bringin accountability.Why does it happentowards the end? Becausesomeone else iswaiting for that work.That can be your manager, teachersiblings, parents. It can beanyone else. But thereis another personwho iswaiting for you for that work.Now, you put the same thingthrough accountability.You will appoint someone asyour accountability partner.And they will push you the same way,not in figurative sense,not in real sense, figuratively.They will point out saying"Ankur, you weresupposed to do X in thistime block, have you done it or not?Why have you not done it?What is happening?" So they willactually make you feel 'bad'for not adhering to the timeblock and getting your work done.It feels like if theaccountability partners are friendswe will be able to fool them, but no,our mind works in avery different way.The minute there isan external side to it,we become a lot moreaware and a lot more consciousthat we do not let go downsomeone's trust again and again.And that makes accountabilitywork really well.You can deploy these shortcuttechniques tomorrow onwards itselfto start beatingprocrastination. But this,as I said, are shortcut techniques.These won't solve the long-termproblem, which is -why do you procrastinatein the first place? To solve that,you need long-term strategies.Number 1 -please make the goals you set inlife achievable goals.Many peoplesay"I will study till 25,marry and have a child till 30,have 2 kids by 35,house,till 40I will have a bungalow, luxuries,international vacations."Each and every goalmaking it achievableis a distant thing.I am not saying thatyou will not be able toachieve these thingstill these specific ages.I am sayingthat there is no sub-plan for settingthese and for setting this time.These are just random.The society and the world said it,so we agreed.And suddenly,you feel liketime is running,you are not doinganything towards it,and the goal is becoming bigger andbigger and less and less achievable.So you start procrastinatingit even more.It's counter-intuitive.What you have to do isset goalsthat you know you can achieve.I'll give you a great example.Ruchi and I are on afitness routine currently.And Ruchi, my wife,often says an excellent thingthat diet is a very importantthing in fitness routine,we all know that.I will never follow a diet which Icannot follow long-term.For example, we like sweets.So we will nevergo a diet where we have tocompletely stop having sweets.We will follow a diet in whichwe can eat sweet,in moderation,and we know when we caneat and what we can eat.So that it becomes easy for us tofollow. This is aachievable goal or target.Due to this, we don'tprocrastinate. We don't say thatwe will start it from tomorrow,day after and so on.We know that doing thiswill make our life better,we will be healthy, our bodywill respect us,so we have to start tomorrowand we also know that thetools required to follow thisare now in our hands as wehave made this achievable.We have not tried to follow a dietwhich we will try togive up in a week itself.Now, thisis the example ofbeating procrastination usingachievable goals.Number 2 -Make your environmentclutter-free.And when I sayenvironment, I don't meanjust physical things.It does not mean your desk hasto be clean, all your thingshave to be sorted. It also meansyour relationship environment.Those peoplewho are your friends,your siblings or parents,relatives,colleagues,how do they make you feeland how do they operate on adaily basis? Becauseit is very difficultto be surrounded by those peoplewho procrastinateor who keep making funof you because you do it,or keeping taunting you thatyou often procrastinate,do not ever motivate you,do not ever encourage you,do not ever support you,and you still have to show upas the person who is winning.This is impossible.It's like if you want to quit alcohol,you cannot try quittingwhile being among alcoholics.It is impossible, it won't happen.The same way,you have to make yourenvironment clutter-free.It starts withfollowing the right kindof content on social media.You are most likely in your 20s.And you spend most of your timeon your phone on social media.It can be YouTube,or Netflix or Instagram or Discord.The content youconsume will determinewhich stories you make in your mind,will determine that howyou will behave in life.So it's importantthat you keep your environment,starting with your content,clutter-free.Number 2 - make yourenvironment clutter-freewhen it comes to your relationships.Particularly thoserelationships whichyou can choose, like your friends,your colleagues as well.Choose those peoplewho motivate you,who make you positive,who are ready to becomeyour accountability partnerbecause they want to help yougrow. And that is what youneed to surround yourself with.And lastly,try to change your environment ifyou cannot choose them.This is largely family.Many people stay infamilies which are toxic,where there is unhealthy environment,and my only suggestion often isthat if youare financially independent,then please move out.Because that way, you will saveyourself and the relationship.Moving out does not mean youstop fulfilling your responsibilitiesas a son or a daughter.It just means that youwill maintain a distanceso that you can always be therefor them whenever they need youbut you do not spoil your lifestaying with them and getting caughtup in their life.And finally, extremely important,good exerciseand good nutrition.There is a scientificreason behind this.When we exercise,when we eat well,our body responds. And the way ourbody responds is the way our mindresponds. Our mind andbody are inter-connected.They are not two different things.It is not that our body andmind are walking separately.Everything is inter-connectedand you know this.So if you feel goodabout the body that you have,if you feel healthy,if you know that you are fit,it automatically makes you get upand do things.You wantyour fitness, your health,your happiness, your optimismto translateinto action.Because that's who you have become.So spend time with peoplewho are action-orientedand also spend time on yourselfto make your bodyand your mindaction-oriented.These long-term strategiestake a lot of time.No one is born with all this.And only and only through practise,through dedication,through deployment,you will be able to achieve this goal.But until you don't do that,you will always be avictim of procrastination,you will be agoalyou will become used to an effectwhere you will not even realizethat howanti-action you have become.You don't want to becomea anti-actionperson. You are a personwho wants to Do Epic Shit,which starts with the word 'do'.'Do.' Many people think,many people dream,many people have desires,very few people do.And that 'do'is the defining trait of everybodywho's conquered procrastination.'Epic' meansdoing something larger than yourself.And 'shit' means you have funwhile you're doing it.It never feels like youwant to get done with it, it doesn'tfeel like you're doing thesame thing again and again forcefully.No, I get upevery single day wanting tocreate content for allof you because I knowthat there will be at least few peopleout of the ones who consume thiswhose livesmight change by a bit. And thatis enough for me, to get upand to make this because I genuinelylove helpingpeople. And 'Do Epic Shit'then becomes my life motto.It should be yours as well.If you want to beat procrastination,you have to believethat this is not a character flaw,this is not ainability in you,it is just a choice that you makeon how to acton things that you have to do.I will see youon the other sideof procrastination asthe actionninja.
