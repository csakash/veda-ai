Ruchi and I are founders anddirectors in our company,but we perceive thecompany's finances separatelyand draw a salary forourselves every month.My annual salary is â¹38 lakh.Ruchi's annual salary is â¹35 lakh.This is the money thatwe take from the company.The remaining profit of the company,which is usually betweenâ¹4-6 crore each year,has to go through taxesand other expenses. The money is used to build a corpusthat will be used to fulfill theambitions of our company in the future.We don't see it as our entitlement,atleast as personalspenders of that money.In our home, we have a pre-taxinflow of â¹1 crore 23 lakh per year,and after a 30% tax deduction,we get around â¹86 lakhs in our hand.In this video, you will learnhow we spend these â¹86 lakhs,so that you can take awaysome lessons from it.First and foremost, protection.Life insurance primarily for my family and our two children.For that, we pay anannual premium of â¹17,103. This gives us a base insurancecover of about â¹10 lakh,and on top of that, we have takena top-up of around â¹50 lakh,to be precise, â¹41 lakhs.So, the total coveragebecomes â¹50 lakh,for which we have paid an extraamount of around â¹31,000 for 3 years.Firstly, health insurancefor myself, for Ruchi,and for our two children.This is divided into two parts.Firstly, the base insurancewhich has been runningfor many years,which is a â¹9 lakh cover.For this, we pay â¹17,000 annually.And then there's an additionaltop-up of â¹41 lakhs,making the total coverage â¹50 lakhs,and that is what we feelis necessary and minimumfor a family our ageand our size.We pay an extra amount of aroundâ¹10,000 per year for the top-up.So, the total health insuranceexpense for the family is â¹27,000.Secondly, which is very important,is the health insurancecost for my parents. Both parents are over 60 years old.So, they have a lot ofhealth insurance to pay for.Our family is not included intheir health insurance policybecause that's a bigmistake people make.Don't mix your parents'insurance with your family'sbecause as soon as they turn 60,your premium bill will also go upbecause the premium of healthinsurance is determined by the eldest person in the plan.So, keep your parents'insurance separate.You can be a part of it,but don't make yourfamily a part of it.So, for the healthinsurance of my parents, there are three of us:me, my father, and my mother.The total expenditurefor that is â¹72,595,which is a fairly big investmentthat you make every year,but it's a necessaryinvestment to make.To buy health insurance, whetheryou're buying it for your parents,or for yourself,I highly recommend PolicyBazaar.I buy my policies from there.This video is sponsoredby PolicyBazaar.So, let me quickly tellyou how you can do it.Self, spouse, son, daughter.Let's say you are buying it for that.My age is 43,wife's age is 43,son's age is 12, daughter's age is 6,and then the pin codeis 121003, Faridabad. My name isShahrukh Khan,and my number is 9999777666.There are no existing illnesses, no surgical procedures,and then you will see the list of plans I could go for. As I mentioned,a minimum cover of â¹10-25 lakhsis advisable for this family,this age, and this size,and please adopt the"No room rent limit" option.So, you see, almostâ¹2,000 per month,or if you do it for the whole year,you will get aboutâ¹20,000 to â¹24,000,which is close to what we pay.We been paying for many years,so no claim bonus, etc., all adds up.The decision will be about decidingyour health insuranceacross multiple plans,Care, Niva, Star,Birla Capital, Bajaj, HDFC, and so on.This will give you comparisons, the best price,and of course, direct access to both the support and the mechanism of PolicyBazaar.The third item is term insurance.This was the best decisionI made at the age of 31.At the age of 31, I took a20-year term insurance plan. I should have taken it longer, but let me explain why,and I have taken aâ¹10 crore insurance plan.Term insurance means that ifI diewithin this term of 20 years, my familyor whoever the nomineeis, that I have decided,will receive this amount,which is â¹10 crore. If I remain alive,neither I nor my familywill receive anything.So, thismay seem like a foolish thing to dobut is actually thewisest thing to do.Why? Number 1:You get protection againstyour death for a period to give your family the financial protection they needin the event that you areunable to generate incomeor you are no longer there. Number 2:Number 2:The highest insurance cover comes atthe lowest premiumfrom term insurance.If you go for a â¹10 crorepolicy in which you get insurance, you get a return, and your premium is also returned,then you won't get thisâ¹1,25,000 per year.It will be a lot higher and when you do the math,you will realizethat over time,its return is less and it doesn't really give you the protection you need because to pay â¹10 crore,you have to pay a very high premium.Number 3:Number 3:It is protectionagainst the uncertaintythat makes us all feel scared.Death.So, in the unfortunate event of death,you have term insurance as the best plan that you can take.In this, you can add many riders.There could be acritical illness rider,meaning if youhave an illness thatprevents you fromgenerating income,you can be covered.So, you get a payout or a cover.You can also becovered for disabilityand death is not theonly option you go for.As I mentioned,at the age of 31,I took a â¹10 crore plan.The thought was thatby the time I'm 51,with this 20-year plan,I will have my own â¹10 crore,and that's why Iwouldn't need anything beyond that.If I were to makethis decision again,I would have taken it forat least 30 years, not 20,so that until the age of 61,there's a base cover.Again, PolicyBazaar is the bestplace to buy term insuranceand let's understand how it's done. So, Shah Rukh Khan is back, and my date of birth is 01/01/1995,which makes me 28 years old.Let's assume that,and phone number remain the same, 999977666.If someone has this number,please forgive me if youreceive a prank call. Do you smoke and chew tobacco? Thankfully, no. My annual income, let's suppose,is between 10 to 15 lakhs.I am salariedand a college graduate, and now let's see the plans.Now, when you look at these plans,usually, the plan providesa cover of â¹1 crore. You can decide what you want.Let's say you wanta cover of â¹5 crores,and if you go for a â¹5 crore cover and if you want to pay yearly,you save an additional 5%,so this will comedown to only â¹40,000.This is the realityabout term insurance.The sooner you buy it in your life,the lower your premium will be. Look at this.You're covereduntil the age of 60,so it's not like you've chosenonly a 20-year plan like mine.You're 28 years old,and you've givenyourself a protectionof â¹5 croresuntil the age of 60.You are only paying â¹40,000.Right now, it might seem too much,but as soon as 5-6 years pass,these â¹40,000 won'tmean much for you.And you will easily pay for a 5 crore cover that you get.And of course, youcan keep going higher. If you go for a 10 crore cover, it's only â¹80,000,which is a lot less than â¹1,25,000,which I started paying 31 yearsago, which is 12 years ago, and its value todayis much higher,and of course, you willonly need to pay â¹80,000. There is ICICI, there is HDFC, there is Max, there is TATA AIA.The best thing about PolicyBazaar isthat you get to compare and choosewhat works best for you,and you can compare all the plans, so you know that you are choosing the best.Next, our food expenses.Food expenses fall intotwo main categories,actually, three categories.First, what are called thebasic staple food items,like potatoes, onions, and tomatoes.These have become a bitmore expensive recently,but these are the basicneeds that you have.Above that, almost all our vegetables come from an organic farm. We have rented a farmwhere we have an areaof 1200 square feet,and whatever growson it belongs to us.Every week, we get produce from it,so a large variety ofgreen leafy vegetables,and all others like brinjal, okra, cucumber, and of course, spinach.For this, we pay â¹5000 per month.They take care of everything,manage the farming,water the plants,and we can go and help, but that's not mandatory. I love it becauseit's organic, chemical-free,pesticide-free food delivery. It comes to your door.The startup's name is Edible Roots.It's a startup that mywife used to work at,and we have continued tobe great supporters of it.And then there are fruits.Fruits can be quite expensive, but we spend a lot on our fruits.So, mangoes, bananas, apples, grapes,cherries, strawberries, and so on.But roughly, our monthlyexpenditure on fruitscomes to around â¹15,000,which adds up toâ¹1,80,000 over a year.Maintainence and electricity.We live in a well-maintained areawith amenities such as a tenniscourt, gym, swimming pool, and power backup. The maintenance is well taken care of,so we have to pay aconsiderable amount for that.Additionally, our house iscentrally air-conditioned.It has a seperate costbut on an average, we payaround â¹24,000 per monthfor maintenance and electricity,which comes to approximatelyâ¹2,90,000 a year.Car and petrol expenses have become essential for us.It's not really a choice becausewe have a large family with childrenwho need to be taken to various places,and the parents alsoneed to travel around. So, we have rented a car.We haven't bought a car, but we have a Nissan Magnite. We pay â¹25,000 per month for it.This is the high-endmodel with automatictransmissionand all the features.So, a three-year subscription at â¹25,000 per monthworks brilliantly froma financial perspective.We have created aseparate video about thiswhere you will be able to see whether you should buy a car, rent a car,or rent a caband what are theeconomics behind it.The combined expenses of petroland this car are significant,totaling around â¹45,000 per month.As petrol prices have increased,it costs us about â¹20,000.Since we travel quite frequently, in a year,we spend about â¹5,40,000on the car and its petrol.Then, the household expenses.Household expenses includethe cost of hiring help,the driver's expenses,and all the other needsthat arise in the house,whatever needs to be managed. All of this does add up to about â¹75,000 a month,and most of it comesfrom our salaries.We love being very generouswith our salary for our helpbecause genuinely, they assist us so muchand abstract away so much from theday-to-day thingsthat we have to do.If you've seen the videoof my morning routine,all of this is possiblefrom me and Ruchibecause we have so much help.There's someone to cook, someone to sweep and mop, a driver,someone to fetch milk, a cook,all of those things really, really helpand that's why this money is the best use of our money.Finally, the biggest expense in the category of needs is our children's education.Both of them go to a veryexpensive international school.The fee for them is quite high,totaling â¹13 lakhs per yearjust for their tuition fees.But those are the expenses for the needs category,which totals to â¹34 lakhs.Now let's talk about wants,about the things we desire. These are not essential for us,we can live without them,but we still spend on them because God has given usand we are working hard for it.So why not?Firstly, in that category, clothing.Ruchi and I don'tspend much on clothes.We already have a lot of clothes,so we mostly wear the same t-shirts and other items.We don't go to partiesor events much,so roughly about â¹25,000 isspent on our clothing each year.We have subscriptions,like your Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, or other services.When combined,they amount to aroundâ¹2,500 per month,which adds up to â¹30,000 per year.In terms of books,we spend quite a bit. There's no real limitation to this,but roughly â¹4,000 per monthgoes into our book expenses.I buy a lot of books on Kindle,Vidur buys a lot on Kindle,and Ruchi prefers physical books.So, in a year,we spend around â¹48,000 toâ¹50,000 purely on books. It's a wonderful investment.I'll still call it"wants" because these things,I'll still call it "wants"and not "needs" becausethese things can be accessedthrough a library as well.The library expense might fallunder the "needs" categoryThe library for our kidswas in the needs categorybecause we feel it is a necessity.They need to learnhow to read books and enjoy them, so we do that quite well there.So, for now, we have categorizedthese expenses as "wants."It's split, but we will see.We have a separate librarysubscription for our children.It's a wonderfullibrary called OneUp.They go there,and every week, theyget four books to read.They read them and really enjoy them.It's a bit costly, but it'sdefinitely an investment to be made.Vidur also attends a weeklyclass in the library edition,where they have a bookclub kind of sessionwith other kids, readingand writing together. It's creative writing plus reading,and I believe it's agood investment to make.So, that's â¹75,000per year for that.Gifts.We give a lot of gifts, as we really enjoy giving them.This is outside of the team gifts. Team gifts also add up,they're given everyquarter here and there,but these are personal giftsfor birthdays, for anniversaries, for anything else, which is around â¹1 lakh per year.Miscellaneous expenses that I've leftout would be around â¹1 lakh for that.Eating out. We don't eat out much, but whenever we do,eating out is expensive these days.We order in, but it'salmost negligible,maybe once every two months.When we go out, it'susually only then.Ruchi and I go on adate every Friday, and there's some expense there.Then, maybe on Saturdays or Sundays,we go out with the kids sometimes.So, roughly â¹10,000 per month,which is roughly our investment. That's â¹1,20,000 per year.Travel is a big onethat has happened.So, we spend around â¹15 lakhs per year on traveling.This includes aninternational vacation, some domestic vacations,small weekend trips,and we try tomanage as much as we canwithin this budget.So, this has becomea big expense for us,but roughly around â¹20 lakhsper year for our needs.Since last year, there hasbeen a significant difference,the lack of home EMI.So, at the beginning of this year,we completely paidoff our home loan, and the way we did that wasby liquidating all of ourinvestments that had reacheda good rate of returnover the past several years.We used the liquidatedamount to pay off theremaining home loan,which was around â¹80 lakhs.So, we are now loan-free.We don't have anydebt on our heads,and that means we aresaving a lot of money, which we are, of course, splittingamong different categoriesimportant for us.So, our total budgetfor needs is â¹34 lakhs.And then finally,  investments.There are four types of investment.Public market,which are mutual funds, direct stocks,or smallcases or PMS.Most of my investment happens in PMS. Most of the company investmentsare in PMSand mutual funds. Most of the personal investmentare in mutual funds and smallcases.So, â¹25 lakhs towardsthe public market.This is Ruchi and my personalinvestment that we make. Then in private, we usually investâ¹7 lakhs per year in startups.In real estate, almost none.In crypto, not yet, as wehave reached our target.So, this is the total sofar that we have reached.In public market, our investmentis currently around â¹11 lakhs.In the private market, over the years, we have invested almost â¹37 lakhs.No exits have happened yet, so it's still â¹37 lakhs.And in crypto, we areat around â¹33 lakhs.Three coins, which is one Bitcoin,ten Ethereum,100 Solana. I am holding them.I believe that these will bewidely valuable in the future. It fluctuates up and down.I don't even look at it.I probably checked it after agenuine six months to get to it. It's around â¹32.8 lakhs,which is about â¹33 lakhs.So, this target has been fulfilled,and now there's no focus on crypto.But the total deployedis about â¹81 lakhs.Now, because we had torepay the home loan,most of the publicmarket investment,around â¹80 lakhs as I mentioned,we liquidated itaround February of this year,and that's why thisnumber is so down.So, this is gradually coming back, and it's now around â¹11 lakhs,but we can't sell theprivate ones because private investments are illiquid. Crypto is being held, and the that's something we hopefully will never have to sell.So, if you add allthese things together, you'll see that needs are â¹34 lakhs,wants are â¹20 lakhs,investments are â¹32 lakhs, which totals to about â¹86 lakhs,the same as what ourin-hand income is.And the share of income is interesting.So, 40% goes towards our needs, 23% towards our wants,and 37% towards our investments. I feel this is a really good mixbecause we startedinvesting very late in life.For a long time in our lives,we didn't have much money.Whatever moneyI had was investedcompletely in myprevious startup, nearbuy,which didn't work out as well.So even now, I'm stillinvested in it butI've never been able toliquidate those assets.So, starting almost from zero again at the age of 40,these things had to bestarted again slowly.And over time, we wereable to build that corpus.So, it's very importantthat we focus moreon our investments so that we don't miss out on the goals we havefor both our retirementsand our kids' education and future.In all these expenses, one thingIn all these expenses, one thingthat you may have noticedis that there is no useless spending.There are things we dofor our own love, for our own joy, for our own happiness, and that is very differentfrom most people who maybe earning this much money.Earning 1.25 crore rupeesa year is not a joke.There are very, very few people inIndia who can reach this number.So, we are very gratefulthat we have reached here. But with this sense of gratitude,there's also the realizationthat this money has comethrough a lot of luckand after a long time.So, it's important tospend it on things thatwe know are necessary forlife at the age of 40. There's no need to show anyone,prove anything,or tell anyone about it.I'm sharing all this with youso that you can see the principlesthat I follow in my videos,which I recommend,like the 50-30-20 budgetrule and all that.I'm applying them inmy own life as well. It's not about saying one thingand doing another.The same rented car, the same basic clothes, the same simple needs, but most importantly,investing in kids' education,investing in our growth,investing in our experiences, and of course, investing our money for the future.I hope through this video,you've foundsomething thatyou were looking for.Ankur Warikoo,signing off.
