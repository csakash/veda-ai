As a content creator I do something thatvery few content creators dobut by doing that I generatean income of â¹15 crores annually.What is that?Digital marketing.In this video, I will share with youall the details about digital marketingthat I have learned in the last 12 years,and then help you also replicatethe same success that I have achieved.This statement sounds immodest,but I genuinely believe thatdigital marketing is something thatvery few people use becausethey think it costs a lot of money,but that is not the case.First of all, I want to start withan apology,and this apology comes very sincerelythat you are fed up with watching my ads,and I know that a lot of peopleon my YouTube and Instagramare super irritated by watchingmy ads repeatedly.I wish I could control it,but I cannot control it,and I will tell you why as well,but I want to start with this apology.I also want to start by stating the factthat it is a full process,it is a full system that I have createdto make sure that there isthe highest amount of returnfor every single dollar that I put intodigital marketing.To understand digital marketing,we will cover three things.Number 1: What is the coreand the most fundamental metricof digital marketing?Whenever you run ads digitallyfor your courses, products, services,or anything that you want to sell toa user, on Google, or Facebook mostly,on which metric will it be optimized?Number 2:How do I use all this machineryof digital marketing for my courses?I will show you the actual datafrom the dashboards, Excel sheetsso that you are able to understand it.And number 3:I will show you how you can becomean expert in digital marketing throughUdemy through the best professorsand instructorsthat are available in the world.Let's start.Number 1:Whenever you deploy digital marketingfor your courses, products, services,or anything, there is one metric thatat the end of itis the most important metricand it is called ROAS, Return On Ad Spend.Its simple translation is,if you spend â¹1 on digital marketing,then how much money do you get in return?Now, of course, the right answer should begreater than 1,but ROAS calculates a ratio,which is how much incomehave you generated totallydivided by how much money you spend.For example, my ROAS acrossall the courses and across all the spendsis close to about 1.75,which means if I spend â¹1on digital marketing,then I get â¹1.75 back, which is greatbecause now I can spend unlimited money,I might be doing it as well,and until this ROAS is above 1,I know that I will get more than â¹1 back,and I continue doing that.To give you a scale sense,I spend â¹55-65 lakhs monthlyon digital marketing,which is a fairly big number,but this number started 2 years backwith â¹1.5 lakhs per month.I had to spend even this â¹1.5 lakhsper month gradually.It's not like if you do not haveâ¹1.5 lakhs,you cannot start digital marketing,I will tell you how that works.You need 4 things for digital marketing.Number 1:You need an audience.Who are you going to show those ads to?And it's perhaps the most important thingbecause everything derives from this.If you'll be showing your ads to someonewho doesn't need what you are selling,or it is irrelevant,or they have already bought something,then you are actually not deployingthe best use of your money.Now to determine this audience,either Google or Facebook,and whenever I say Google,it means Google search, YouTube,all the Google banner adsthat you see on some other sites,and whenever I say Facebook,it means Facebook, Instagram,and wherever else it is possible,though it is not possible right now,it could be WhatsApp as well.So Google and Facebook givea lot of tools to predict or determinethis audience.For example, you can select this audiencebased on interest.If you say,I want to sell a courseon time management,then all the people who showedtheir interest in procrastination,or in time management,or in productivity,might be interested in time management,and that is something that isa good way of predicting.The other thing is, lookalike audiences.What are lookalike audiences?For example, around 2.5 lakh studentshave bought my time management course,so if I tell Google and Facebook,look for more people likethese 2.5 lakh students about this course,and they will then start formingconnections like,that person who bought this course isfriends with this person,and they share some common interests,so that person might be interestedin this course, or any such filterbecause Google and Facebookknow so much about our movements,about our likes and dislikes,that it is easier for them to formthese lookalike audiences.The third can be through demographics,people between the age of 18 to 22people who live in Delhi,people with this education,people who live in this location,people who work in this company,whatever data you would give willinglyto Google and Facebook,and they can use the data willinglyor use it with permission to find outwho you are,you can use all that data and selectan audience.This is the first step towardsa digital marketing process.The second thing iswhat kind of ad do I want to makefor this audience?You must have seen my ads in video format,my ads come in text format as well.If you search on Google,you can see the ads in text format,there are no videos,and often there are no images as well,only text is there,so that could also be an ad.If you see a banner image on a website,that could be an ad,it is neither video nor text,it is a banner image or a banner ad.So all these combinations are available,but most importantly,you have to determine which scriptor copy will be good for this audience.Copy means what would be said in this ad.Often when I select my audience,I come up with a certain theme.That theme could be,people who have seen this ad a lot,I will make a theme saying sorryyou get to see this ad a lot,if you are fed up with this ad,then you can go to this linkand stop the ads.But if you are still interested,then here is what I want to tell you.If you are a procrastination audience,then I will make a scripton procrastination for time management.If you are a productivity audience,then I will make one for productivity.If you are on the edge,you are on the landing pageand you have checked out this coursebut still haven't bought it,then I will make a different script thatyou went on my page but you didn't buy,this could be the reasonand I want to solve that reason.This audience and script matchis the most important thingthat you need to know,because after that,digital marketing expertise takes over,and as I said, there are courses fromUdemy which will very beautifully tell youall the digital marketing tools and tips,and you will then knowhow to master this art.Then number 3 is something called CTA,Click To Action.What do you want the users to do afterwatching the ad?Should they click on buy now?Should they enter an email address?Should they enter their phone number?Should they fill out a lead form?What is the ultimate action thatyou want them to take through this ad?For example, if you are runningan expensive course,let's say it is for â¹25-30K,then it is possible that someone may notbuy your course worth â¹25-30Kby watching just an ad,or you are selling something which isworth â¹25-30K,but if you get them to expressan interest,sign up for something which is smaller,for example, a lot of people doa sample webinar for freeor charge â¹99 or â¹199,and the people who come for that webinar,they give them a sampleof the bigger course,and then they ask them,if you want to sign up for the coursethen only for the next 24 hours,this course worth â¹25K is only forâ¹19,999 for you,something like thatwhich gets people to convert.So you essentially have to figure outthe action for this ad.It could be an interest,it could be a lead,it could be a direct purchase,it could be any combination of theseand that should be your focus.And finally, point number 4, landing page.If you know the audience,and you know which languageand which copy will you useto generate interest from that audience,what do you want them to do as CTA,or Click To Action, then your linkwhich they will clickand land on your page,What should that page look like?What should be there on that page?For example, as you can see on the screen,this is the landing pagefor my time management course calledTake Charge Of Your Time.I am not promoting this coursein this video,so there will be nothing about this coursein the pinned comment or the description,but I just want to show youhow this actually works.So you will see all the details like,what will you get in this course,about me,who can take this course,so you can be an entrepreneur,a working professional,a freelancer, a student,you will get a certificateonce you complete the course,there are testimonials that will tell youthat these students have taken this courseand they are really excited about it,there are loads of testimonials,there's no question asked refund policy,frequently asked questions,and at every point in time, the CTA is'BUY NOW'.Let's see how many times'BUY NOW' appears.You will see this is the third time,fourth time, fifth time, sixth time,so this 'BUY NOW' keeps coming upbecause that is the final actionthat I want everyone to take.So by combining these four things,who is the audience,what do you want to tell them,what do you want to get done,and how to get it done through the page,this is how the digital marketingprocess works.And finally, how do you pay?So Google and Facebookor any such digital advertisercharge on largely two bases.Something called CPM or CPC.CPM means if someone will see your ada thousand times,then how much money will you pay for it?Cost per thousand Impressions.It varies in India basiswhat kind of audience have you selected,on which platform are you doing it,at what time, daytime or evening,which week of the month are you doing it,which month of the year are you doing it,it completely varies.But to give you a sense,it could be anywhere betweenâ¹50 to â¹300-400, even higher.So that means when someone will see thisad of yours a thousand times,you will have to pay â¹50, or â¹100,or â¹200 for it.There is another thing called CPC.Meaning, every time you show an ad,we will not charge for it,and you will not pay any moneyuntil someone clicks.If someone clicks, i.e. a cost per click,then you have to pay whatever the CPC is.Again, CPC varies a lot.It could be as low as â¹3-4 toas high as â¹20-30 dependingon what kind of audience you want to haveand which text or keyword do you wantto have their interest in,and that could be in high demand.For example,if you want to sell car insurance,and car insurance is very competitive,a lot of people want to sellcar insurance,so if you go on Googleand type car insurance,you will see a lot of ads.If someone clicks on any of those ads,then naturally it isa very valuable click,because somebody is searchingfor car insurance,so that cost could be very high.But if you search forWarikoo YouTube videos,then nobody is trying to sell somethingon Warikoo YouTube videos,so if you run an ad on that,its CPC would be very less becausecompetition is very less,frequency or the scale of searchesis very less, and so on.And that is how all of thiscomes into place.All this may seem to be intimidatingand overwhelming, but trust me,it is a very simple and beautiful science,and if you learn it,you will not just help your business,whether it is freelancing,whether it is actually your startup,you will also be prepared for the future,because digital marketing is onlygoing to get bigger in the future.Every single one of us,most of our time is spenton digital productsand through that digital product,we are becoming aware of newerdigital products and services.Once you understand digital marketing,then you will know how to captivatethe attention of the peopleand audiences at large.As I said, there are amazing coursesavailable by Udemy, which run coursesthrough globally well-recognizedpractitioners and professionals,and you will get themat very attractive prices,and I will show you a few courseswhich are my personal favoritewhen I started my journey.Now to show you actual data, how it works,and the magic of it all,look at the screen.As you can see on the screen,this is the daily record of my spends,its performance, and how we break downits performance.For example,I'm showing you October's data,and let's pick a date in October,let's pick 17th October.We spent â¹2,32,000 on 17th October on ads,and we made 502 sales.These 502 sales wereat approximately â¹579.How?It is 232 divided by 502.So what is our cost per action?579.Now at the cost of this 232,we earned â¹2,93,000,which is a profit ofâ¹61,000 approximately,and that came at a very low ROASor Return On Ad Spend of only 1.26,i.e by spending â¹1 we got â¹1.26 back.If we look at the previous date,16th October, by spending â¹1 we got â¹1.66,and we made a profit of â¹1,50,000.If we look at the next date,ROAS is 1.5,and we made a profit of â¹93,000.If we look at the whole month,we spend around â¹55 lakhs,we generated sales of â¹85 lakhs,and our net profit was around â¹31 lakhsat an ROAS of 1.56.This ROAS does not coverthe organic sales,those are the sales when people directlygo to your site and buy something,that is additional to all of this,this is only the digital marketing spend.There is a further breakdownof all this among all the courses,and you will seehow all of this data translates.But the best part, these are basedon each course also.So if I want to show you,this is only for time management.If we got on 17th October,out of â¹2,32,000, we spentâ¹2,04,000 just on time management.There were 463 sales,the approximate value of every salewas â¹523, we earned â¹2,20,000,and the profit was â¹16,000which is really really low.On the previous day,we made a profit of â¹87,000,and on the next day,we made a profit of â¹50,000,and then there is a breakup,like which were the live sales,i.e. the courses which comewith live classes,the option which doesn't comewith live classes, so on and so forth.And the same thing is also done forevery single platform,Facebook, Google, and so on.For example, if I look at Facebook only,on 17th October, we spent almost â¹85,000on Facebook, we got 198 sales at â¹614,and earned â¹76,000,which means we lost â¹8,500 on Facebookon that day.But if I see the same thing on Google,on 17th October, we spent â¹1,19,000,we got 265 sales, we earned â¹1,44,000,so we made a net profit of â¹25,000,and then of course a lot of data.You will see, all of this is massive data.How much was the CPM on 17th October?Let's just see how that is.The CPM on 17th October was around â¹100,which means on every 1000 timeswhen this ad was shown,we paid Google â¹100.On those 1000 times, we got 0.57% clicks,which means when people saw thatad 1000 times, then 0.57 is 57 times.Is it 57?No, that would be 5.7%.Sorry, just a second.1% of 1,000 is 10, correct, right?10% of 1,000 is 100, 1% of 1,000 is 10,so 5.7, ok.CTR i.e. Click Through Ratio,how many times did people clickon all the impressions?That was 0.57%.This means if people saw the ada thousand times,then 5.7 times people clicked on it,so there are a lot of peoplewho did not click on the ad,and that is always the case.CTR is always between 1-2%.And then there were views,the conversion on those views,and then finally the conversion ratiofrom the conversion is 3.62%,which means the total number of peoplewho clicked on that ad,3.62% of those people actually bought it.All of this data is something thatGoogle and Facebook will give you,and then we recorded iton the Google sheetso that we can analyze all of this,but the larger thing is digital marketingis a way where you have all of this datain front of you.If you want to get into any detailand find out which ad is doing well,which audience is doing well,which platform is doing welland at what time,which landing page is doing well,all that data is available for you,but to master that,you need to then havethe right credentials.And for that, Udemy.I have often spoken aboutthe courses on Udemy.It is one of the best platformsif not the best platform to learnfrankly anything,because this is taught bythe best practitioners in the world.My favorite digital marketing courseon Udemy is,The Complete Digital Marketing Course-12 Courses in 1.You will learn
