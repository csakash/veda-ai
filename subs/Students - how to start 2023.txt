I talked to 13 toppersin the last 2 weeks.Toppers from IIT-JEE, UPSC,Law, Commerce, CA,and I tried to understandtheir study hacks.In this video, I will sharewith you 9 study hacks.Number 1:Almost every person said to recognisetheir productive hours.None of these 13 had any consistencyas to when they were most productive.Some people in the morning,some people at night,and some people during the day.What they did was they found outwhich 4-5-hour slot werethey most productive in,and they planned theirmost difficult study at that time.This is such a great hack.It not only applies to studiesbut also to life.And the way to do that iswhenever you adoptthe most difficult taskin your most productive hours,that task doesn't remain that difficult.And during the remainingnot-so-productive hours,you can choose to do easy tasks,so that in a day you actually feelvery productive.Number 2:Everyone said that it is very importantto find your learning style.This is a very interesting medium.Everyone said thateverybody's learning styleis different.Some people learn by listening,some people learn by seeing,some people learn by reading,and some people learn by doing,and that is why it is very importantthat you do not adoptonly one standard method ofreading and writing,try to understandhow you enjoy learning the most.I remember, some toppers said,we learned by watching YouTube videos,so we actually searched that chapterto study if somebody had madea YouTube video on it,and that's how we learned more.There are some who still learnby writing because that ishow they rememberand comprehend things well.There are some people who learnwhile talking to themselves,some who learn by doing,and some who study while listeningto the audio,and all of these can coexist.It is your responsibility to identifyyour learning style,and learn new things through that.Number 3:Probably 12 out of 13 people saidthat we used to keep our room,our desk, our wardrobe,and our bed very organized.The more clutter there is,the more clutter will be in our minds.The more books are scattered,tables are placed here and there,plates, bowls, and glasses are there,shouting out to mummy to make tea,do this, do that,the more there will be tension in life.So almost all of them said thatit is very important for usto be organized.But that doesn't meanit's in their nature to be organized,they forced themselves to keep their room,their working environment,and their desk organized,and that is beautiful.So they recognizehow much the environment impactsyour mindset when you sit down tostudy or learn something new,and that's something thatyou can learn as well.Number 4:This was fascinating thatthey had so much clarityand such a young age.They realized that wheneverthey were stressed,they could never deliver productively.They could not study, they had tension,their mind used to wander,their heartbeat used to be fast,they started sweating,they used to lose sleep at night,they used to stop eating,and what they also realized is thata good way to relieve stressis to have good relationships.If you have good relationships,with your parents, with your friends,with your working colleagues,that will help you relieve stress,because by involvingin those relationships,by talking to them,by genuinely and transparentlysharing your fears, doubts,self-doubt, insecurities,your stress reduces.And when stress reduces,the body also reacts in the same way.All the negative chemicals thatget released because of stressare not there.You feel more energetic,you feel happier,you feel like you want to do things,you feel excited,and you feel hungry properly,you get proper sleep,you are able to work wellthroughout the day,and you are not too lazy.This is such a great reflection.In fact, I don't knowhow many of you know this,the longest study of the world,a scientific research that lastedfor 85 yearstracked people from their birthto their end for 85 years,and they tried to figure outwho lives the longest and healthily.What they also found out iswhat these toppers found out.Good relationships explaineda bulk of healthy long lifebecause there is less stress,and that is something thatyou can learn as students as well.Number 5:Based on this, almost everybodymanaged their social media in a waythat they eliminated negativity.It's interesting that theydid not eliminate social media.Almost everybody watched YouTube,Instagram, Netflix,but what they consciously avoidedwas anything that generatedand negative feelings in them.Surprisingly, it could be their friends,so they muted their friends.They said,we don't want to knowwhat our friends are doing,whether they are partying,going on a vacation, dining out,and here we are slogging to study,we don't want to know that,because that only makes us feelor question whether we are doing itthe right way or not.So they took out everything thatgenerated a negative emotion in them.Anything that triggereda negative emotion in them.Whether it was people who made them feelthat they could not do it,they are inadequate,they are not worthy,they are incapable,or anything that was negative,whether it was news or familyor anything like that.They only and only consumed social mediafrom a positiveor an entertainment perspective.Very smart!Number 6:All 13 people exercised every day.And exercising not in the way thatthey were going to the gym,building muscles,no!Basic, just to keep their body in motion.Almost everyone went for a walkin the morning or evening,which I found to be really nice,and almost 4 or 5 of them said,whenever we sat in the sunshineduring the day,we felt better about ourselves,and we felt like we were alive,because the whole day we are insidethe room or in a library,we didn't even realize what the time is,so we just used to step outin the balcony or terrace or outside home,and just feel the sunshine,whether it's winters or summers,and that just makes it good.And probably there isa scientific reason to itbecause whenever vitamin Dgenerated by sunshine is low in our body,then you do feel lethargic, lazy,and out of energy,so whenever you feel like that,please step out in the sunshine.And exercise, surprisingly, walk,run, cycle, swim, anything basic,you don't have to play a sport,you don't have to go to the gym,you don't have to do yoga or pilates,something that you can do whichyou know you can be consistent withwill definitely help youas it helped the toppers.Number 7:Almost everyone said thatthey did not necessarily take classes,in fact, I spoke to a UPSC topper,and that video is about to release,and she told me thatshe did not join any class.She only self-studied,and that was fascinating,but I asked her how did she do self-studybecause it can be really hard.And what she figured was is thatself-study is what works for her,she also figured thata lot of online resourcesare available where you can use help.So almost all of them said thatthey used a lot of online resourceswhether they are online courses,online tutorials, online classes,online exam papers or test prep,online videos, or anything thathelps them not spend a lot of timeon physical classes,and then a lot of them used it in a waythat they knew which online modewould be the best for them basedon their learning styleand productive hours.So as a student in the 21st century,please use online in the best way you can.Number 8:This was also amazing!All 13 people said thatthey spent some time every daywhere they did nothing.Chilling with friends,chilling with family,watching a movie, watching a series,reading or watching jokes,doing anything that entertained us.And what was beautiful is thatit was almost a set routine.So it was not like,should I watch it for 15 minutes,5 minutes only, just one Reel,just one Shorts!No, they were very disciplined about it,and they said,we will set our distraction timeonly in the evening or morningor whenever it was.And that's something thatI have also mentioned a lot of timesin my videos is that a big hackto being productive is to seta distraction time in your routine.Decide at what time in your routineand it could be at multiple times as well,thrice for half an hour or whatever,I will spend time to get distracted,I will watch what I want,and I know that it doesn't add any valuein my life but I want to do it,because when you do this,you are telling your mind,dude, don't lose your focus now,don't get distracted, that time will come,and when that time comes,we'll have fun for a good half an hourand just chill.That is such a smart way ofplanning yourself.And number 9:This was amazing!Many of them topped or clearedtheir respective exam onthe second attemptand not on the first attempt,and when they didn't clearon the first time,they did one thing,they started analyzingeach and every topper's video,because all the toppers share their videossomewhere that we had done this,we had done that,and they went back to the basics.They saw very clearly thatthere was something lackingin their preparation,and so they said that the topperwho has already done it,what did they do,and they just literally went backto that playbook.And I find that smart because thatis the principle of life as well.Many times in lifeyou don't need to do anything new,if you repeatwhat people have already done,you will find predictable success,whether you enjoy that successor not is a different matter,but if you want to clear that exam,you want to clear that interview,want to get into that company,want to fund that startup,want to get into that relationship,there are enough and more peoplewho have done the exact same thingbefore you,and through them, you can learn a lot.So use the experience of othersto learn from and to make yourself better.If you do that, you will move towardsyour preparation like a smart person.13 toppers share these 9 stepswith me which I felt werecommon amongst all of them.Very different people,very different examinations,very different styles of studyingand preparation,and very different durationfor which they prepared,but these commonalitiesmade it so amazingthat I wanted to share themwith all of you.In 2023, to win as a studentor as a working professional,these 9 steps are for you.I hope this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
