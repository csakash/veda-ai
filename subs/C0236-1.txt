Check 1 2 check 1 2In this changing worldSo dramatic!?In this video, I will share with youall the skills that you must acquirebefore you turn 30,also where can you acquire those skills?Friends, the world is changing rapidlyI was actually addressing the reallybig university in India yesterday itself.Their new batch has just joined,it was in the remote mode,and I was telling them all abouthow to carry themselves in college,how to spend their time in college,but I left them with what I felt wasthe most important message thatI could share with them and that was,that all of us feel that the purpose of collegeis education, to teach us something,whether it is engineering or commerceor humanities or journalism or music, anything,but I think that the definition of collegeand thus the purpose of college hascompletely changed. And unfortunately,college is not able to fulfil that purpose properlybut despite that, the definition has alreadychanged whether you like it or not.Friends, the world is changing so rapidly!When our parents used to go to college,whatever they used to study there,became their profession for life,whether it was engineer or doctoror lawyer or anything else.The time when I went to college,there are many people who are not pursuingwhat they studied in college.It took them almost 10-20-25-30 yearsto change their careers,but they did change it.They did engineering but nowthey are doing marketing.They did software engineering but nowthey are doing product management.People are taking many divergent choiceswhen it comes to their careers.And all of you who are still in your late teens,in your 20s, you are sitting on such arapidly changing world that the onlypurpose of college is not to educate youbut to teach you how to become a student.Friends, college has just one purposeand that is to teach you that how can you learn.Because you will have to learn my friends.You will have to learn something new every 10 years.Every 10 years, there will be new technology,new ways to work in this world, and youwill have to train yourself for that.And you cannot go to college at that point.There will not be any teacher or professorwho will be teaching you at that time.You will have to learn it yourself.And the process, the journey of understandingwhat it is to learn new things is going to formthe biggest skill of the next century.AgainAnd the process, the journey of knowinghow to become a student is going to be themost important skill not just for this yearbut for the future.In this video, I want to share with youall those fundamental skillsThrough this video, I want to share withyou all those skills which I feel arevery important for this decade whichis 21 to 2030 but I also believe that by thetime 2030 comes all these skillswill have to be replaced.You will have to bring a new replacementin your skills, in your mindset.Somebody else will be telling you about it,I don't think I will be making videos after 10 years,but somebody else would be telling youabout the skills of those times,but until then, irrespective of where you are,whether you are 18 19 27 or 30 itself,these in my view, are the skillsthat you need to advance in your career.I have brought these skills to you afterfiltering out from udemy.com.All the links are there in the description.As a disclaimer, all of these areaffiliate links which means if you go and...As a disclaimer all of these are affiliate linkswhich means if you click on them andgo to Udemy site and buy any course,then I get an affiliate revenue.I use that affiliate revenue to sponsorthe education of kids who can't afford it.Every month...Every month between two â¹2-4 lakhsis spent on sponsoring the education of kids,right from school all the way up tohigher education.

and interaction interfaceIf you can understand the details of UX and UI,which are User Interaction and User Interface,then you know what users wantand you can build for them.Next, Become a Product ManagerProduct manager is a role which Google introduced.In fact, many companies used to do it earlieralso but Google popularized it.It basically means that you are the ownerof a technology product, where youtake care of its end to end.So think of it like the CEO of the productYou will decide why the productshould be launched?You will decide what will bethe features of that product?You will decide the price of that product?You will decide what will be thedistribution and launch plan of that product?You will decide what will be the next featureor the next version of the product?So you think of yourself as the manager of a product.If you are technologically inclined,then understanding what it means to becomea product manager is a very important skill.You don't have to become a product manager.I am not asking you to adopt the careerof product management but how doesa product manager think of a product,how does he/she visualize theentire product making journey isan important skill to build.An Entire MBA in 1 CourseI have mentioned this course earlier as wellMBA is a great course because it teachesyou the fundamentals of business ina way that helps you to understand economicsand helps you understand everythingaround economics.Economics not as a subject, economicsas a way of doing things, making moneyI remember when I was a science studentand I went for an MBA program,it helped me so much because allmy perspective was limited to science.Did I say nirbhit?!I wanted to say limitedbut I don't know why I said nirbhit!Anyway, so it was limitedSo if you ask me who are themost important men and women in the world,I would have said Einstein, Madame Curie,Archimedes, Newton.I didn't have any idea about what istechnology, sales, marketing, IT, HR,so when I went to ISB it opened my mindto a whole new world and that iswhat this program is going to do.I don't want you to spend crores of rupeesand go to Harvard or Wharton,or spend lakhs of rupees and go to ISB or IIMor unfortunately spend the same lakhs of rupeesand get a degree from a bad institute.NoMy idea is, understand what an MBAdoes for you, and this course,sitting where you are, which will tell youin 8 hours fundamentally everythingthat you should know in an MBA programit is a great start.Facebook Ads & Facebook MarketingNot many people are using Facebookas a product may be,but Facebook as an ad engine isbeing used by many people.If you want to understand digital marketingand how you can promote your product,your service, your company,your brand on Facebook throughan ad campaign, then this is a great courseand absolutely a skill that you need to master.Similarly InstagramIf Facebook is huge then Instagram is as hugeIn fact, now it is even more hugeand will get even more huge in futureInstagram is clearly on a roll andunderstanding marketing on Instagramis a great skill to have.It trains you on how to spend moneywisely and get an outcomethat is profitable for you.Automate the Boring Stuff
