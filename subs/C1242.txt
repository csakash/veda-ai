Number 4: My library.This is one of my favouritesections, of course, because we have all our books here.We don't buy all our books physically.So, I start readingmy books on a Kindle, and then, if I like that book, then we buy a physical copy. But in this also includes a lot of gifts which I keep getting. A lot of good people are there,some of whom are friends,and they keep gifting books. And then, this entire space of this roomis what we call the den.So, here we have a sortof an entertainment setup.We have a televisionwhich no one watches, but this is where Iend up reading my books.So, it's a wonderful, nice and a little loungey affair.And I like it because it helps me relax,gives me visibility over all the books,and I can spend frankly hours in this spacedepending on the bookthat is engaging me. And of course,natural light coming in.Everything around me is set up for me being focused. There is no distraction.There is no element whichshould not be in this room, or should not be in this space, and that I believe is suchand that I believe is such animportant component of youbeing productive or not. In every space,whether it is the smallestspace or the biggest space, it could be an office area, it could be a college area,it could be your homeor anywhere else,if there are distraction elements,and if there are a lot of them,then invariably, yourmind will be distracted.It could be a notificationpinging on your phone. it could be something that is moving out therewhich distracts you.People are coming in,or the doorbell is ringing. There is some noise.All of that adds to the clutter in your mind, and the more your mind can be free from that clutter, the more you will be able to focus, the more automaticallyyou will believe thatyou are productive because you will get more done in a short period of time.
