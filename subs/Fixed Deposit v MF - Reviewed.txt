A lot of people feel that whenwe talk about mutual funds,we only talk about investingin the stock market.But they are wrong. In mutual funds,In mutual funds,you can also investin debt instruments.In mutual funds,you can also investin debt instruments.And in this video, we will try to knowwhether we shouldinvest in fixed deposits or in mutual funds,and what is the differencebetween the two.Firstly, let's look at why fixeddeposit is a part of this conversation.If you look at the screen, this is the last 10-year chart.The interest rates through RBI, they have been falling on an average. So, in 2014, it was 8%,and it kept going down,and in 2020, it was around 4%, but after Covid,it started rising, and now it is 6.5%.So, the favourite instrument,fixed deposits of our parents is now back in the game, and they are like, âInvest money in fixed deposits. 6.5% every year.No risk. Nothing. It will keep growing. Best thing ever!âBut a very few people know that through mutual funds,you can generate similar returns,maybe even better returns, and more economically.In this video, we willtry to answer 4 questions.Number 1: Why is fixed depositbetter than mutual funds?Number 2: Why mutual funds arebetter than fixed deposits? Number 3: On an average,Number 3: On an average,how much tax do weneed to pay on fixeddeposit returns andmutual fund returns?Number 4: On an average, how much return can we expect?This is where the mostimportant disclosure will happenwhich you might not know.Number 1: Why are fixed depositsbetter than mutual funds?Now, it is quite obviousthat fixed depositsprovide a mental stabilitybecause you know there is a bank.The bank is mandatedthrough the RBI.It is disciplined.It is licensed.So, all the checks andbalances that we needto secure our money,we feel their presencein fixed deposits.The best thing though is fixed rate of return. It is human naturethat the positionwith the least risk,we tend to gravitate towards it because it is predictable.So, if somebody is telling youSo, if somebody istelling you that 6.5%, not on an average, but fixed return will be generated, then you will naturallywant to fall for it,and that is whythere is so much of love for fixed deposit.The second thing which isextremely important to know is fixed deposit is actuallya really good way toprotect your money.So, often when Icriticise fixed deposits,I do that because people look at fixeddeposits as a form of investment.Wrong.Look at fixed depositsas a form of protection.So, if you want to protectyour emergency fund,put it in fixed deposit.If you are going to invest yoursavings in the next 1-2 yearsand you are not sure where to put it,fixed deposit is a greatplace to park your money. If your parents have grown old,they have retiredand they have received a corpusthrough their gratuity or their PF,then naturally,they might not want along-term investmentfor many years.They have to usetheir money every day,and they have to protectthe capital as well.Fixed deposit is brilliant for them.So, wherever you want protection,wherever you want stability,wherever you want predictability,fixed deposit is far, far betterthan most other things out there.But fixed deposit has onefundamental negative point,and that is what we willcover in question 3.Now, let's try to understand why mutualfunds are better than fixed deposits.Number 1: You can easilyget into mutual funds. You can easily exit it.It is true for fixed depositsas well but in some FDs,there is a lock-in periodwhich is usually notpresent in mutual funds.Of course, in mutual funds,there is an expense ratio and an exit load.Expense ratio meanshow much money do youpay mutual fund managers to manage the mutual fund.It could be between 0.5-2%,which is money that theydeduct from your investmentand they invest the rest of the money.Some mutual funds alsohave something calledexit load.If you exit from the mutual fund, you will have to pay a charge.But a lot of mutual fundsoperate with zero exit load after a certain period of time.We will come to that as well in the third question,but the most importantadvantage of mutual funds is it offers a massive selection.Mutual funds havemany different types,and I am not even talking aboutthe stock market mutual funds.I am not telling you to buywith the Nifty 50 index,or buy midcap or small cap,or buy the PSU index,or the IT index, or nothing like that.I am talking about debt.The conversation around fixed deposits regarding stability and predictability,taking that into consideration,we will explore mutual fundswith respect to debt only.But you will be shocked when I answerthe 4th questionthat there are waytoo many mutual fundswhich you can evaluatebasis your need,your risk profile,and of course, your investment horizon.But before that,question number 3.Tax.One big drawbackof both fixed depositsand debt mutual funds is the tax slab.So, if you invest inequity mutual funds,or if you invest in the equity market,then it comes underthe capital gains tax,and that means that if youryearly profit is under â¹1,00,000, then you do not have to pay tax.Awesome. If it is above â¹1,00,000,then the question arises thatwhether you did it within 1 year or after 1 year from the point of buying? If you sold it within 1 year,then your tax comes out to be 15%over and above the first â¹1,00,000 in profit.If you sold it after 1 year, then just 10%.Now, that suddenlybecomes very attractive because a capital gains tax of 10-15%is something which is literally one of the lowest tax slabs,and you feel good about it,but this is not true for fixeddeposits and debt mutual funds.In fact, since a long time,fixed deposits have been deductedbasis the income tax slabs.Debt mutual funds didnot follow that rule butDebt mutual funds didnot follow that rule butrecently, they were alsoincluded in the income tax slabs,which means whateverreturn you generate,which in fixed deposits means the interest you earned,and in a debt mutual fund means how much did you gain as profit, the government will tax it at your income tax slab.So, if you are in the10% income tax slab, then 10% tax, 20% tax in the 20% slab,30% tax in the 30% slab,and that is how it works.So, unfortunately, it is not tax efficientwhen you compare it toequity mutual funds.But the good thing isFDs and debt mutual fundsdo not have a difference when it comes to tax.There was a difference but now,zero difference,which then brings me to the lastand most important point.How much returns can you expect?So, let's try and seethose numbers upfront.So, as you can see on the screen,first of all,we have the retail fixeddeposit rates of SBI.SBI is India's largest bank.So, its FD rates,you can expect the sameFD rates everywhere.There is a big differencehere which I will come to,but let's just see on an average what is going on. The most important will be the1 year plus because all thetime frames lesser than 1 year,7-45 days,45-180 days,180-210 days,give extremely less returns.For these time periods, you shoulddefinitely go for an FDbecause I am assumingyou will need your moneyin this time frame.That's why you are parking it.Otherwise, there is no logic at all for you to be starting an FDless than 1 year.So, please make an FDfor more than 1 yearif you don't needmoney within 1 year. Let's see what the rates are.So, if you look at the rate from1 year to less than 2 years, then it is almost 7% annualised.From 2 years to less than 3 years, it is 7.2%. From 3 years to less than 5 years, it is 6.6%. From 5 years to 10 years, it is around 6.6%.Usually,Usually, the 2-3 year FD is the most attractiveFD to go for.The sweet spot of 3 years is usually the best for the banksand there are two reasons why.Number 1:It is important toknow that an FD is anincome source orgenerator for the bank.When you park your moneyin a bank for 2-3 years,then the bank knows that this money isgoing to be with them for 2-3 years.This person will not most likely askfor their money before this time frame.So, they can take this moneyand create a loan for someone else.Now, what would that loan be? It could be a retail car loan.It could be a retail home loan. It could be a business loan.It could be a personal loan.Every single loan will be higher than this rate of interest because the cost of capital,the rate at which theyare taking money from you,is almost 7.2%.So, they will loan this amountto someone else at a higher rate,and the difference wouldbe the bankâs income.So, FDs are veryimportant for banks togenerate that cash thatthey will lend out,but it is also importantfor the bank to ensure that they do not take a huge risk.For example, suppose that this rate of 2-3 years, which is 7.2%,is also the rate for5-10 year time frame.And what happens istheir economists failed to seewhere will this rate of interestwill go within 5-10 years.And that rate of interestwent down significantly.Let's say it became 5%.I don't know howand you don't need toknow the details as well but let's saythe rate of interest of RBI becomes 5%.Now, they have your FDfor 5-10 years at 7.2%,but in the market,the actual rate is 5%.So, naturally, they will be in a loss.So, wherever they canbreak down the FDs, they will try to.So, that's why 1-2 years,2-3 years, 3-4 years,4-5 years, 5-10 years, the more sections they can make, they will do it to ensurethat they do not beara loss in the future.So, you are getting almost 7.2%if you park your money in anFD in SBI for 2-3 years right now.Now, let's see what that compares to a debt mutual fund.To compare debt mutual funds, I am using Coin. It is not a promoted post.I personally use Coin.That is why I am showingyou everything here,but you are free tobuy your mutual fundsfrom anywhere.The only thing I would suggest is please buy mutual funds directly.Mutual funds are sold asgrowth mutual funds as well.Don't buy them becauseit means that there is anagent in between who isgoing to take a commission.So, your expense ratio will be higher in a growth mutual fund.If you buy directly,then you say goodbyeto the commission,and you pay far lesserexpense ratio to buythe same mutual fund.Now, where do you buy it from?It doesn't matter.Everything will be in your depository.It is just a platformwhich is an intermediary.It is like you are buyingVistara tickets from MakeMyTrip. So, Vistara is giving you the ticket.MakeMyTrip is just anintermediate platform.It does not perform any other role.So, I have selected debtas the mutual fund,and you will seethat in debt,there are a lot of categories.There is something called liquid,overnight,banking and PSU,ultra short,dynamic, corporate, money,and a lot of people don't know that even in debt mutual funds, there is a large variety.So, let's try and understandwhat they are so that to make awise decision that whether you should go for an FDor a mutual fund. First of all, liquid.Liquid mutual fundis a great mutual fundfor mostly businesses. So, a lot of our company money,our personal possessions,so, a lot of our company moneyoften goes into liquid fundsbecause we have that money today.Let's say we have to make abig payment after 7-10 days.So, why don't we earninterest for one week?Whatever we earn,it will be free money, right?And letâs do that. So, liquid mutual fund is almost like you havekept your money in a currentaccount or savings account.There is no interestgiven in current account,and whatever 3-4% youget in savings account, that is the interest.And you can withdraw at any point of timeafter 24 hours.No cost to you.So, let's see what it offers as a return.If you look at the mutual fund, let's have a 3-year time frame.So, if you look at theSBI liquid mutual fund,and whenever we searchfor all of them, it will be ordered in AUM,meaning Assets Under Management,which means how muchmoney is invested in it.So, there is no preference.Please do not follow it. Make your own decision, but I will click the first one, whichever it is.I don't care. The SBI liquid fundfor the last 5 years,it has given an averageof 5.26% return, and you will see it's a fairly straight line.This is the beauty of it.Itâs almost like a fixed deposit.So, if you had gonefor a fixed deposit,it would have been a straight line.There was no confusion, right? That's the same thing you will see here as well.The blip here isonly because interest rates fluctuated during the Covid periodof 2021-2022, and that's why you will see it. And then, you will seewhere does it allocate.So, certificate of deposits,which are government backed, treasury bills, which are government backed,commercial paper, which is not government backed but it is backed by securities, andother smaller entitiesbut basically, it is very, very secure. And here are the investments. So, 91-day treasury billis basically small loansgiven out by government.They have invested in them.Small industriesDevelopment bank of India.They have put money in their FD.Reliance Retail Ventures, they have bought their corporate bond. Canara Bank,they have opted for their FD. There are 91-day bill and 182-bill here as well.These are based on dates basically,and it keeps releasing.So on and so forth.So, you will see all those and you know that none of themis Warikoo Random Bank,or any co-operative bank of sorts,no bank here is such thatit could shutdown overnight.So, itâs fairly secure andthatâs why it gives thispredictable growth.You should not put your money here because this is for extremely short-term periods, but itâs good to know. Then, letâs go to Ultra Short, or actually Short Duration.If we go to Short Duration,we see the ICICIprudential short-term fund, and letâs see what that does.Again, our time frame is 5 years. 8.07%.Wow! 8.07%. Itâs almost like an FD with almost 8%and it is constantsince the last 5 years. But you will seesome fluctuation.Itâs not this curve now.It is not a straight line. The fluctuations are visible.Itâs not as volatileas the equity market but it is happening.So, letâs try and understandwhat is its composition.Youâll seea lot of them aregovernment securities.So, just because their ratescan have ups and downs, notevery day,but the kind of government securities that they are buying.So, there is 7.38% government security,8.51% government security,7.06% government security,7.93% government securitybecause the government issuessecurities at different interest rates.So, youâll see all of those and here is the split. So, non-convertible debentures, which is a financial instrument,again, of investing,government securities, certificate of deposits,all of these are invested but the combination of this is giving you a fairly good return.A fairly good return and this is short-term.So, if you want to park your money for 2-3 years, then remember that SBIgives you almost 7.2%,and if do this for 3 years,then itâd be around 6%,which was last 3 years when interest rates were down.So, usually if youconsider a long period, actually, if itâs just one year,it is 8.43%,and if you look at SBI rates for 1 year,or 211 days to 1 year,itâs between 6-7%, which means this is going to be higher than that.Now, letâs come to the next one,which ismedium duration.Medium durationwill be typically between 3-5 years,and letâs just see SBIMagnum Medium Duration Fund.Go to 5 years, and 8.22%.So,what was it here?For 5 years, it was 8.07%. 5 years in liquid fund gave 5.26%, and this medium termgives 8.22%.You will seemore ups and downs.The more the returns increase,the more your volatilitywill also increase, but the best thing is this volatilityis manageablebecause again,the backing of this is here.We have debt here.So, this is most likely corporate debt.So, yes, you will see Larson & Toubro debt,Tata Housing DevelopmentCompany debt,SIDBI debt,another financial company calledAvanse, its debt is there.I have no idea about it. JM Financial,Jindal Steel. So, these are corporate bonds,meaning the companies whichannounce their own loans,and 70% of that isin the mutual funds.25% in government securities. So, it is naturally going to beriskier than what the government backed is.Now, letâs goand look atlong duration.This is the one in long duration. Nippon India Nivesh Lakshya Fund. Okay. Never heard of it.Look at the up and down.Itâs almost like equity.Letâs go for 5 years.9.14%,right? So, what was medium duration?8.22%.And short-term before thatwas 8.07%.It has become 9.14%.Now, why is it 9.14%?Again,youâll see,oh, GSecis actually 97% but there are various GSec.So, there are many smallgovernment securities here at different rates,and thatâs why there is up and down basis when they are buying it,what they are buying at,and so on. Now, it becomes your call.Long duration, for 5-10 years because thatâsusually a good periodfor you to invest ingovernment securities.So, if you want to invest in adebt mutual fund for 5-10 years, then these long duration mutual funds could be something that you consider. Letâs look atmedium to long duration. Okay. ICICI Prudential Bond Fund. 7.89%.Again, up and down.What all is here? GSec is 70%,NCDs are 26%.Okay.Letâs look at,I wanted to see corporate bonds. Yes.HDFC Corporate Bond.What are corporate bonds? Just like I said,these are companies whichannounce their own loansand they are then bought bymutual fund managers,maybe even some retail investors,and so on and so forth.So, youâll see that if I select 5 years here, it is 7.70%. So, lower than the So, lower than the long duration ones, but youâll seeNCDs again at 76%,and we will see many more here, Bajaj Finance bond,SBI Tier-2 corporate bond,Mangalore Refinery bond,some bonds are takenon floating rates,National Bank for Agri andRural Dev bond is there.So, you haveall of these, and again,risk is much lower as you will see from the smoothness of the curve,and at the same time,you havehigh returns as compared tofixed deposits.So, we see from thisthat mutual funds are notjust for the equity market. They are also for the debt market,and within debt mutual funds as well,there are various typesof debt mutual funds basis your risk profile,and your investment horizon.So, if you want to investfor the short term,less than 2 years, then please park it in an FD.There is no otherway because youneed that moneywithin 1-2 years.If you have a 2-3 year horizon, and if you are comfortable,then you can put it in FD, but you can also put it into a short-term mutual fund.There will be some risk but you will get better returns.If you want to park it for medium term,If you want to park it for medium term, for 3-5 years,then again, you canchoose something like a corporate bond orit could be a medium-termdebt mutual fund. If you want for long term,for 5-10 years, then you know that the FD rates take a dip after 3 years, and you can go for a long duration GSec or government securitiesbacked mutual fund where you willmost likely get better rates.When youget all of this,When you get all of this, you have a lot more information, and all these arefor just one purpose,and that purpose isyou have to,and that purpose isyou have to, whatever you do,beat inflation.Your tax adjusted return,wherever you put your money, must be higher than inflation because if you arenât able beat inflation, then every year,inflation is rusting away your money.So, inflation is 6% right now. It stays between 5-6%,and that means if you are inthe highest income tax slab, or suppose you are in 20% slab,and you are getting, say,a 7% return,then on a 7% return, if you pay 20% of it as tax,then you will be left with 5.6%.It canât even barely beat inflation. But if you get an 8% return, and pay 20% tax on it, you will then be at 6.4% beating inflation,and that should be your approach towards any debt investment that you make.My debt investment for my safety,my predictability,my mental peace, or any other reason, no judgement at all, that has to beat inflation of almost 6%. If you are able to do that,then this combinationof debt mutual funds should help you. I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo,signing off.
