And in India,the same books were a lot cheaper.Because there was an Asian edition of themIt used to be a paperbackand no hard corver.And I am assuming thatthey used to make cheaper editionsfor Asian students.So, the same book worth Rs. 5000,in Nai Sarak, which isa very large book market in Delhi.In old Delhi, Chandni Chowk,was worth Rs. 400.And I was like, boss, this is brilliant.So, I, one day,took a big suitcase,and reached Chandni Chowkin bus via Lajpat Nagar.And then, after going there,I filled my whole suit case with books.I think I bought some, if I am not wrong,some 40-45 books.Resnick Halliday's and Irodov and alot.If you are a physics student,you would know.If you are not, no problem,these books are expensive, just know that.And then I went back to the US,I listed them all on a site called Ebay.Ebay is still running.At that time, Ebay was famous forsecondhand booksor other secondhand things.Anything second hand,it could be second hand clothes also,second hand cars also, bikes, whatever.And books, of course, was a big thing.So I listed these new booksbut Asian edition as secondhand books.So, I bought it for Rs. 400which is like $10.And I listed them for 30 or 35 dollars,and it got sold out overnight.I was like wow.I put some more for $50,even that got sold out.Then at 55, that too got sold out.Then at 60, it didn't sell.So, I came back to 55.And I sold all of these 40, 45 books inlike two weeks or so.I earned around $1,000.And with that $1,000, I made my first,I would say non-financial investmentwhich was to buy a laptop.That laptop has been with mefor so many years.It went with me for the last year of US.It was with me for that one yearof work experience before I went to ISB.The whole year in ISB,I worked with the same laptopbecause I didn't havethe money to buy another laptop.So, that laptop worked very wellfor four years.It was a very heavy laptop.Because we used to get those laptops only,it was from HP.But he was like the best friend ever,I used to listen to music on it.I used to watch movies on it.I used to finish my homework on it.I used to do all my readings on it.And I think it wasone of the best investments I made.And what made me happier was thatI did all of this with my business idea.which was an arbitrage of Asian editionbooks and the US edition books.After coming back from the US,I had to take a jobbefore I went for my business school.Because we needed money at that time,there was no way,it wasn't like I am from a rich family.A lot of humble beginnings, in fact,at that time, we took a lof of loan.So, I had to help not just myselfbut my family as well.So, I did my first job of my life,in this company called NIS sparta.It was a job of Rs 15,000.And 15,000 felt like so much at that time,they even asked me in the last interviewthat what is your expectation?I was like, if I tell you,you would start laughing.So, I didn't tell.I am like, whatever you give me, frankly,that would be more than the expectations.Because I didn't have any faith in me,at that time.And they said, we'll be able to givea maximum of 3 lacs for this role.And after deductions, you'll get 14,800.That's it. What are you talking about?So, I used to get 15,000 per month,in that drive.I thought I'll buy a bike too.Because expenses were a lot.My office was at Kalkaji,I used to still live at Lajpat Nagar, soit's not that far, but far enoughthat if I took a bus,it took a lot of time.Auto was very expensive.I was like, let's buy a bike.Because bike would be the best option.So, I bought my first bikewhich was my big investmentat that point in time.The bike was worth 30,000 or 35,000I made around Rs. 10,000 of down payment,which was through my first salary itself.So, I got my first salary 15,000,I gave 10,000 as down payment.And, then I took a loanof the remaining around 30,000 or 35,000The EMI for it was 1,400.I had taken the loan for 2 years.Rs. 1400 per month was EMI.So, from 15,000, 1400 was towards the EMI.The remaining went to parents,house expenses, own expenses.And everything that was remaining, I usedThat is also when I started investing.My first investment wasliterally, the money investment,I opened my DEMAT accountand I bought stocksof this random companycalled Karuturi Network.I don't know if that company still exists.If we talk about that time,this network had gardens of roses,in Africa.And it was world's second largestexporter of roses.I didn't know what got in my mind,I bought it.But here's what fascinated me the most.That stock was worth seven rupees.And I was like seven rupees is very cheap.Everything is cheap if it costs seven.I have to buy the stock of seven rupees.So, I bought these stocks first,of Karuturi Network, whatever it was.At seven rupees, I think I invested aroundRs. 7000 in it.To buy 100 stocks or 1000 stocks.And in just a few months it became Rs. 12.I am like, wow, let's sell it.So, I sold them.And 7,000 became 12,000.I was like the king of the world.I should be writing books on investments.Then, I was like,this was brilliant, let's see more.So, I started looking for more.I saw within a month,Karuturi became five rupees.I am like, it became five rupees?It's way cheaper.I should buy more of it.So, the entire 12, actually,I might have spent some 2,000.I bought more of Karuturiworth 10,000 at Rs. 5.In just a few months,it became Rs. 8.I am like, boss, this is the shit.I am going to do thisfor the rest of my life.I will never have to work ever again.I sold that stock at Rs. 8.And then, it became Rs. 2.I am like, dude,I can literally see myself retiring.I am going to go so doubleon Karuturi, like maybe Karuturi peoplewill take my name in their board meetings,like mega investor.I bought all the stocks in Rs. 2.It never went up from that Rs. 2.It was worth 40 paise when I sold it.I learned my lesson.I have learned so many lessons like that.So this was my firstpenny stock investment.In fact my first investment of all.I opened my DEMAT accountin ICICI securities,which is, I shouldn't say it,but I will not recommend to anybody.But, I only had that option at that time.There was also something called Sharekhan.There was HDFC securities too.But, I was way too young, so...I did all of that and that worked out.My first legit stock wasright after I graduated from ISB.Or I think during ISB itself I'm not sure.Maybe it was in early 2006s.There was a company called Educompand in Educomp, my father's best friendwas at a senior position.And he kind of fascinated my father,that Educomp is about tobecome world's biggest company.Educomp used to createeducational instructional contentand had its own hardwareto be deployed in schools.So, today a big thing that Byju's doeson an individual level,imagine that happening in classrooms.There would be a screen,and on the screen your whole curriculumwould be shown in an animated form.Teachers would be able to quiz.Students would have someKBC kind of remotes.They'll say some ABCD,and like that the quiz happens.Report will also be shown,everything is real time.Educomp was in that.It frankly felt like a brilliant idea,maybe ahead of its times.I don't know.And I bought it.I don't know what the IPO...This was an IPO.So, I bought it in the IPO.It was about Rs. 40, if I am not wrong.And it did reasonably well.I made my happy money.I was an investor for abouttwo to three yearsafter that I sold itbecause I needed money.And then after that Educomp,I think went for some mega problems orsomething and never recovered as such.But that was my first formal investment.which was not in the penny stock.I wasn't buying gardens of roses.I was buying actual businesses.Which were not penny stocksand that worked out well for me.I took my first...I was about to sayI took loan in my first life.I took my first loan of my life.Which was for ISB.To go to, ISB, at that time,the tuition fee was 13 lacs.And I considered 1.5 lacs as expensesfor living and food.In 13 lacs, living was includedbut food was not included.Books, of course, were not included.And anything,that's your personal expense.There was my good friend in my school,whose father was a senior member in SBI.So, through him I took education loan.ISB already had a greattie up with multiple banks.The best thing wasthere was no collateral.We don't have to put anything for mortgagebecause we didn't have anything to put.Except for our lives.So that was like a blessing in disguise.But through SBI, the added advantage wasusually you get a loan on tuition fee.You don't get a loan on living expenses.But because he was senior.He could then sanction a loanfor 14.5 lac rupees.Which I took.And that was the first and the biggestloan of the Warikoo family.That I took, and I was scared a lot.My father had to become a guarantor.Not because it was colateral.But because if I run away tomorrow,or something happens.So, we need to hold someone responsible.And I was like, you know right, ifyou don't give this loanno one will be able to give it.Because we don't have anything,we haven't seen 15 lac rupees in our life,And I was like, yes, but we need to sign.So, we have to do it. I am sorry but,that's how things are.And he did it.And that's how I gotmy first big loan as well.And then immediately getting out of ISB,I got my first carbecause my office was in Gurgaon,I, at that time, we moved,we used to live in Faridabad.Where we currently live.So, Faridabad to Gurgaonis quite a distance,There was no connectivity.Everything was, there was no auto too.To go from Faridabad to Gurgaon,there's frankly nothingat that point in time, this was in 2006.So, I had to buy a car.And the best and the cheap vehicle,a combination of good and cheap,was, swift at that time.So, it was a very cool looking vehicle.It was a lot of fun, I bought a red swift.VXI model was 5 lac rupeesthat was central,so there were power windowsin the two front seatsand not in the back.But, because our status was such,so that's it, becauseI didn't want to roll every window.And I didn't have the capacityto buy the four windows one.I bought Swift,that was the first investment.It was very fun, but I soon realisedthat purchasing a car is very...is just waste of money.But I'm happy that Iwent through that experiencein whatever shape and form.To help me learn that buying a caris nice, buying a first car is alwaysa special moment.But, then afterwards, very soonyou realize that, okay, it's normal,at least for me,a car is a very normal thing.And then at the age of 29.I made my first big ticket investment.Which was the toughest investmentI've made.I took a loan and bought a house.Not to invest, but for investment.Because Ankur Warikoo is smart.He can never be wrong.I didn't learn anythingfrom Karuturi Network.So, I, there's a property in Faridabadof Omaxe named Neharpar,I bought there.A house worth 18 lac rupees.I put four lacs,remaining I took a loan, and it went on.I think we sold it after three years. And,I sold it for 24 lacs,but all the interest, registration,broker fee, transfer fee,after cutting everything,I think I made a returnof some 6%, annually.Which was less than FD at that time.I think, at that time, FD used to give 7%.So, it didn't make a difference.I think I made a video of that.Which is my first real estate purchase.I decided that day, real estate,at least, I won't invest in residential.If I do, it would be for my own house.And if I want to invest,I'll do it in commercial.Because I'll atleast get a rental.Here, we paid so much interestwhile the house was under construction.It was so farthat no one wanted to live there.Even we didn't go to see.Even if we did go, it was like, our house,but we never sat in it.And then everything was just awash.But those were lovely days.You made mistakes.You reflected on them.You learned from them.And that made you wiser.So my thirties was a very different time.Where I made great investments,in equities, I made angel investmentsbut I fell into the exact same trap.Where I used to thinkthat everyone's an idiot.Only I am smart becauseinvesting in startupsis the only way to make money.So, I put all of money into start-ups.But, that's another videowhich is for my 30s.There should a topic, right,to make videos.And through this 20 year old,my journey in 20s.I learnt never to invest in Penny stocks.Only to invest for the long term.Definitely make as much investmentsin your own self,in your own skills,in your own personality,as much as you make it to make money.And never invest in real estate,early in your life.I hope you learn from these mistakes.Hopefully, you have made your own mistakesand are learning from them as well.And hopefully this video got you in time.So that some of these mistakeswill not be repeated by you.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
