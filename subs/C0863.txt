Check 1 2 ok let's get startedWhat should be yourinvestment strategy inthe financial year of 2022,we'll get to know in this video.Friends, when it comes to investment,2022 is at a very strange beginning,because so much has happenedin the last 2-2.5 years,that you can't be adoptingthe same investment strategiesyou had in the past.Earlier, I have made many videoswhere my investment strategyused to be very simple,where I invested in US stocks,there were four stocksand I invested only in them.I invested only in smallcasein India,very less in mutual funds if ever,and that was pretty much it.But in the last 2.5 years,a lot has changed because of whichthe investment strategyshould also change,and that is the mark ofa smart investor.So in this video,I want to share 3 things with you.Number 1: What has changedbecause of which you need tolook at your investment strategyslightly differentlyfrom what you had in the past.Number 2: Because of that,how have I changed my strategy,I will share that with you.And number 3: I will giveyou a few examples,these are not recommendations,please choose them onlyafter doing your research,of what are the investmentsthat I am trying to makeusing this strategy.Number 1:What has changed in 2022?Actually not just in 2022,a lot has changedin the last 2-3 years.The first impact was because of covid.The whole world was ina lockdown because of covid,the global markets stopped in a way,the business of companies stopped,and because of that,there was a lot ofeconomic pressure on countries.Based on this, the biggest impactthat happened was,a lot of currencies were printed.US dollars were obnoxiously printed.It's important for you to knowthat the government alwayshas the power,that whenever they wantthey can print new currency.And whenever new currency is printed,the value of your current owning,the current cash that you have,is reduced.How?Let's try to understand.Suppose there are â¹100in a country as currencyand those â¹100and distributed in the whole population.Things are made, bread, egg,car, hotel, anything,and these things can be boughtfor â¹100 only.So there is a demand-supplyequilibrium.This means that whatever moneyyou are paying for bread, egg,car, hotel, anything,they have been kept withinthe balance of â¹100.If people will charge more,they have that kind of money.If people will charge less,then would be a lot of peopleand they won't be able to serve them.But if the government increasesthese â¹100 by another â¹50,and they say,'We will have another â¹50for this population.'They suddenlyly everyone has â¹150.And since now people have â¹150,but the things are the same,so the paying capacityof people has increased.If people could pay X earlier,now they can pay more than X,because now people have more moneyand they want things,since there is competition,and there are a lot of peoplewho can pay,so this causes inflation.So, whenever there isa currency that is printed,you get inflation.And in the last 2 years,there has been the maximum amountof currency printed everin global history.In fact, I was readingthe statistics that 40% ofall US dollars ever printed,were printed in the last 2 years.In the last 2 years,since the US governmentwanted to help everybody,businesses needed moneyand support, banks need it, etc.,so they printed notesand gave them as loans to people,but that works against it.But what has happened is,that its createda massive amount of moneyfloating in the market.I'll tell you how that impactswhat has happened in the future.Number 2:Covid has not gone away completely.Since Covid is again ona rise in China,again lockdowns are imposed,so there is still this uneasinessabout what will actually happen.Some industries have reallyprospered as the pharma industryhas completely gonethrough the roof,online educationhas gone through the roof,anything which is around online,which is around deliverieshas gone through the roof,but on the other side,hotels, tourism, airline industrieshave been impacted verybadly because peoplestopped traveling.And still, while it is coming back,it is not coming backglobally in the way thatit was pre-covid.Number 3: Unfortunately,this year started with a war.Whatever is happeningin Russia and Ukraine,which is unfortunate,has global ramifications.A great amount ofenergy supply from Russiagoes all over the world.Lockdowns are imposed in Chinabecause of covid,and that's why there'ssupply shortage of semiconductor devices,so our cars, computers, phones,are becoming more expensiveas there is a global supplyconstraint because most ofthe semiconductors in the worldare now produced in China.Because of all this,the market is shaken up.So, what was a crazy runin the last 2 yearshas now become somewhat subdued.As you can see on the screen,if I look at Sensex's movementin the last 5 years,look at what happened once covid came.People thought that the marketwould be devastatedbecause of covid,but that didn't happen.In fact, quite the opposite.In 2020 when covid came,the market went up so rapidlythat no one anticipated it,so if I were to just giveyou a sense, in the last 5 years,which is mostly the last 2 years,the Sensex went up by 90%,almost doubled.But if you look at YTD,which is for this year,from January 1st 2022 till now,the market is down by 4%,it's flat.It went down a lot, then came up,and now it's again going down.If you look at the last 6 months,the late part of 2021,the market is 8% down,up-down-up-down,so it's almost flat.People are asking,'Is this an indicationof recession?Will the market tank?Should we stop investing?Should we stop buying stocks?'A lot of people wrote to me,'We started stock investing3-4 months back,now our portfolio is down,so we care scared,this is our first time.What has happened and why?FD is better than this.'But the answers to thesequestions are in this video.If you look at S&Pwhich is the US index,just like Sensex, there is S&P 500,in the last 5 years,it has gone up 80%,as we can see most ofthe movement has been inthe last 2 years,but if you look at YTD,which is the last 4 months,it is down by 11%.It went down a lot,then tried to come up again,and now it's going down.If you look at the last 6 months,it is down by 7% or 6.5%,down-up-down-up,so the scene is not very clear,and that clearly tells youthat you have to havea different investment strategy.Now, if you knowthat you should havea different investment strategy,then what should be the betsthat you are taking.I have changed myinvestment strategy at 3 levels.Number 1: I have startedto bet a lot more globally.So, in addition tothe investments that I makein the Indian stocks,I have started investingin the US stocks as well.I have been doing thisfor some time, but nowI'm emphasizing on it more.So earlier, if you would haveasked me 2 years back,my split was around 30% US stocksand around 50% Indian stocks.Now my split is almost 50-50.So, 50% US, 50% India,this is my stock investment mix,and this is because I feelthat so much is happeningin the market, that if I bet locally,then that will be difficult,but if I bet globallyincluding US and India...If I make a globallybalanced portfolio,where I am investing bothin US and India,then I feel I am adoptinga more balanced approach.The US is the world's biggest market,that's where the biggestcompanies in the world are.India is the fastest-growing economy,so that's where the mostgrowth potential lies.If we combine both of them,then it becomes a great wayto approach.Number 2: Since you can seethat the market is slowfor the past 6-8 months,it's moving in a flat line,it's a great time to startmaking value investments.What are value investments?Value investments are thosewhen you buy a stockat the right value.It is very difficult to know,what is the right valueof a stock inherently.At least we don't know,because we are not ableto do the research,we don't have thefundamental techniques,we are not that educated,but broadly there are peoplewho are doing a brilliant jobof finding what are the values thatare hidden inside this market,where for the past 6-8 months,it is slightly going ina flat line and there areopportunities.So now I have started takinga lot more stock investments, againthrough a portfoliobut driven towards value investingas against the momentum investingthat I used to do earlierthrough smallcase.And number 3: It is a great placeto be in especially if you area beginner investor bettingon the index.Since overall the market is down,I've shown you the graph of Sensex,I have shown you the graphof S&P 500, then even ifwithout thinking too much,without picking stocks,without anybody's advice,you bet on the index,that means I am takinga bet on the Sensex, or S&P 500,then you are going to getreally good returns overa long period of time becauseas the market recoversand comes back to its momentum,you will benefit from every companyrecovering from post-covid,post-war or post-liquidity erathat are the realities of thelast 2-2.5 years.So, that's a lot of wisdom.Now let's come toa practical implication.The third part of the videowhich is,based on these three thingswhat are the actual investmentstrategies that I am deployingand whether you can use themor not.Again, when I make theserecommendations, then theseare just recommendations please,because I am using them personally,not because I want you to use them.So please do your own researchbefore using them,don't take it as a recommendation,take it as a suggestion,and please take it formy own investment,not necessarilywhat I am asking you to do.As I have mentioned,in India, I do all mystock investments throughsmallcase.What is Smallcase?Smallcase is a product thatallows me to invest ina portfolio of stocks,and those portfolios of stocksrepresent an idea.What does this mean?Suppose I want to invest inHouse of Tata or all the companiesof Tata,then I would have to one by oneinvest in TCS from Tata Group,Tata Motors, ELXSI,so on and so forth,but I don't knowhow much to invest,how much to buy of which stock,should I buy one of each,or should there be a ratio,so on and so forth.What if somebody is doingthat hard work for you?That's what the beautyof smallcase is.Smallcase has multipleSEBI registered investorswho provide guidancethrough smallcases.So through smallcases,they provide you the informationon which stock to buy inwhat amount and the productthen gives you the flexibilityof buying all of thosethrough just two clicks.Your brokerage account would beconnected to your smallcase,and the minute you do that,whatever smallcase you want to buy,you will always havethe portfolio stocksin front of you,you just click on it,if the money would already bein your Demat account,then automatically therewould be a 'Buy order',all the stocks would bein your Demat account,you can sell themthe day you want to,you can top them upthe day you want to,if you want to create a SIPyou can do that as well,the day you want tochange your stocksin any form,you will always have100% control.Smallcase is just allowing youto ride on the expertiseof people who are buildinga portfolio of stocks using ideas.One such idea is theSmartNIFTY Index.Nifty is the Bombay Stock Exchange,and Bombay Stock Exchange...Nifty is the National Stock Exchange.There are two stock exchangesin India.NSE, National Stock Exchange,and BSE, Bombay Stock Exchange.The top 50 stocks ofthe National Stock Exchange,which are the top 50 stocksby value on the exchange,are called the index of Nifty 50.And this Nifty 50 isa very good indicator ofthe overall stock market of India.But if you want to buy someselected stocks from the 50 stocks,you don't know how to do that.This smallcase allows youto do that.The smallcase invests inthe 25 best companies ofthe Nifty 50 index.So they select top 25 companiesfrom the top 50 companiesand they will then allow youto do that.Of course, these are companieswith strong balance sheetsand low debt on the bookssince they are the top 25 companies,but even these top 25 companiescan change.It is not necessary thatthe same 25 companieswill always remain on top.So you also need an expertto continuously keep telling you,that this 25th companyor the 23rd company is no moreon the top 25 list,a new company has been added,or its weightage has reduced,and some other company'sweightage has increased.All of that is a processcalled rebalancing.This means,on every predetermined frequency,the creators of smallcasewill guide you onhow to changethe original investmentof your smallcase,and they will actuallyallow you throughthe smallcase product,again through two clicks,to change it to the currentrepresentation.That is called rebalancing.In the SmartNIFTY Indexrebalancing is done every 3 months,which means every 3 monthsthe experts will again lookat the top 25, and analyzewhether it is corrector has it changed,and if it has changed,then we should let our usersknow about it, and you haveto seamlessly go throughthat and get it done.The CAGR of 2 years is 47.26%,which is very very high,and this means that every yearyou have generated a returnof around 50%.Of course, this is not sustainable.Over a long period of time,this will also settle down,but if you look athow it has performedin the last two years,this is how it is.You can see the graph,this is the SmartNIFTY Indexagainst the Equity Large-cap.This means all the large-capcompanies of India,their movement is denotedby this orange,I think it is orange,I don't know becauseI am colorblind.And this blue or violetor whatever, the top onedenotes the SmartNIFTY Index.So if you had invested â¹1002 years back,then the Nifty indexwould have given you â¹212,and Equity Large-cap wouldhave given you around â¹190.This is one of the smallcasesthat I have brought intomy investment strategyfor 2022.This is a paid smallcase.It charges â¹3,540 every yearso you have to bear in mindthat you will have topay this amount,but there is no other moneybeyond this.All the money then is fortransacting which arethe Demat charges,and I made a separate videofor that which you can check around,How much does smallcase actually cost?The minimum investment isa little high, â¹79,000, becausethese are pricier stocks,but absolutely if you canafford this,a great smallcase to start.Number 2: Since one ofthe conclusions I made in 2022was I want to invest globally,I also wanted that in India,I should invest in those companieswhich have a global footprint,basically MNCs.So the smallcase which isMNCs advantage is a greatsmallcase to do that.So, multinational stockshaving moats of a strongglobal presence,access to global businesses.Indian companies which havea global footprint,so that if there isany fluctuation inthe Indian market,then this stock still continuesto run in a manner isolatedfrom the local orthe domestic market's ups and downs.â¹34,000 is a minimum investment.Again â¹3,540 which isthe per-year cost for that.Its one-year return is around 43%,so you can see that it is fairly high.Again, these are highlyoverstated numbersbecause it is a short period of time,over a long period of time,all of them will settleat around 15-25%,that is what you haveto bear in mind.As you can see, if I goto equity large cap,then you will see,the blue-violet line,which is the multinationalcompanies' advantage,and the orange one is there.So, if you had invested â¹100a year back,they would be â¹150 now,and equity large-capwould have given you â¹131.This is the second smallcasethat I have bought formy 2022 strategy.Number 3: Value stocks.These are the stocks that overthe last two years or mayberecently have reduceda lot in value,making them very attractivefrom a long-term investmentperspective.Value investing is the bestbut also the hardest wayto invest becausewe don't know what isthe right value of a stock,but if we invest in a stockat the right value,it will give us manifold returns.So a very good smallcase thatI have recently bought isthe High Quality Right Pricesmallcase.You will see it investsin 15-22 companies,it keeps changing,that can multiply your wealthin the next 2-4 years.What is the theme?Largely the theme is,a lot of high-quality companieson the theme of 'Make in India',which are being built bythe domestic marketbut their price isalso very attractive,because it could be earlyor it could be down througha correction.So as you can see,in this smallcase also,the rebalancing is done quarterly,so it is we balance every 3 months,there is a large portion ofsmall-cap companies.So 75% of all the investmentsin this smallcase are currentlyin small-cap industries.9% in midcap and 15%in large-cap industries.So there is a high potentialbut since these are largelysmall-cap investments,the risk is also high,which means the volatility is high.So, only invest if you havea long-term horizon,and you are then attractedby the crazy returnsthat it can potentially generatebecause it is buying stocksat the right priceand these are immensely high quality.The minimum investment is alsovery attractive,you can start at â¹21,000 only.Again â¹3,540 but for six months,so it is a little expensivesmallcase, use it if you havethe right time of quantum of money.And then finally, since so muchhas changed in the last 2-2.5 years,and there is so much adoptionaround technology, I founda very interesting smallcasewhich is theWright Innovation smallcase.Wright is a researchthat is why its name is Wright,but innovation is thetrue smallcase.It is investing indisruptive innovationwhich is electric mobility,biotech, e-commerce,digital revolution, and fintech.So in India, there are veryfew such companies,but it invests in allthe companies that are there.So, multi stock portfolio ofabout 25 stocks selectedfrom the top 500 universe.Again as you can see,a large dominance of small-cap,so very early industrieswhich could be doing somevery meaningful work,which you and I may not beable to find out on the basisof our own research.Midcap is around 18%and large-cap is around 16%.One year CAGR is 58%,again very overstated,so please do not take thedecision of investing onthe basis of this,it is something that you haveto be comfortable with,over a period of time it willsettle to 15-25% CAGR.The minimum investment is â¹46,000,so it is slightly expensive.And you will get access for 1.5%of the invested value,so it is quitean interesting model.It is basically a modelwhere your fee forthe smallcase is contingenton the amount you have invested.Let's say, if you have investedâ¹1 lakh, then they would charge1.5% from you which is â¹1500for that investmentand that is how theyprice themselves so it isnot a fixed fee model,it is a variable model,which in my opinion,is slightly better forthe early stages,because 1.5% early onwould be slightly less,it would increaseas it keeps growing,but at that stage,a fixed fee model may bea better model for youto go for.These are the four smallcasesthat I have introduced inmy 2022 investment strategy,in addition tothe momentum strategy investmentthat I make which are these two,Capital Mind Momentum,an amazing smallcasethat is riding on trending stocks.And the second one is,Weekend Investing Momentum,which does exactly the same thing,but I found it to be slightlymore aggressive,slightly more higher riskbut higher return,and both these have beenmy favorite for the last2-2.5 years,and I have continuouslyinvested in them,in addition tothe new 4 smallcasesthat I have picked up.I hope these new smallcasesprove to be useful for you.In US stocks, I have madea slight difference.Earlier I used to buy 4 stocks,and I have mentioned those,again, please these arenot recommendations,so don't take them at face value.I used to invest in four stocksand those were,Shopify, Square, Tesla, and Zoom.Lately, Zoom has performedvery poorly, and I thinkthat was somewhat evident,because as covid startedgoing away, the importance ofZoom decreased.As people started going totheir offices, of course,remote working was notas necessary,but if it is still there,then not so much asI had assumed.So I have not got anynew stock after liquidatingfrom Zoom.All my investments arein these three stocks,but what I've done is,I have taken on long-termbets on the index.So there are two mutual fundequivalents, they are calledETFs in the US market,I have invested in them.One is called VOO,which invests in S&P 500,and that is a Vanguard ETF.And the second is called QQQ,which invests in NASDAQ,and that is by a company called,I think Invesco.So I have taken these two SIPs,and I consistently investin them every month,in addition to the 3 stocksthat I am continuouslyputting in money,despite the fact that lately,they have gone down.This is how I have changedmy 2022 investment strategyin light of the eventsthat have taken placein the last 2-2.5 years.I hope you learned somethingfrom this, and if you haveto make any changes,then this will bea good time to take it.The investment yearhas just started,financial yearhas just started,so you can havea new perspective on yourinvestments for the financial year 22-23,and hopefully what we sharedin the video was somethingthat you can consider.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
