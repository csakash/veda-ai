The title of the video is9 hacks for mutual fund investing.Number 1:The first mutual fund thatyou should invest in isa tax-saving mutual fund.Every salaried professional getsa limit of â¹1.5 lakhsthrough which they can saveon their taxable incomeand eventually taxes,and a part of it is ELSS,Equity Linked Saving Schemes.These mutual funds investin the equity market,but your money is locked in for 3 years,you cannot withdraw it before that.The best thing about it is the moneyyou will invest in ELSS,which will 100% be deductedfrom â¹1.5 lakhs according tothe limit of section 80c,which means you will be able to savethat money in your taxable income,and that is a smart hackto start investing in mutual funds.Number 2:Many people ask me when to quita mutual fund?And a simple yardstick for that isif any mutual fund is beating the index,and Nifty 50 is the benchmark index here,Nifty 50 is the performance indexof the top 50 stocks of India,so the pace at which Nifty 50 is growing,ideally you have to grow better than that,otherwise,you can invest in Nifty 50 itself.So if the growth of your mutual fundis lower than the growth rate of Nifty 50for 2 consecutive years,then please quit that mutual fundbecause you have spent enough timetesting it.If it still happens,you've already lost 2 years,so it will have to recovera lot to get there,and you are better off selling itand making your money grow fastersomewhere else.Number 3:We buy a mutual fund based on NAV,Net Asset Value.As we buy a company's stockand it has a stock price,similarly, a mutual fund has a NAVwhich is equivalent to a stock price.Many people feel that a low NAV meansa better mutual fund.No!More NAV means a costly mutual fund.No!NAV is just a number.Don't invest in mutual funds based on NAV.Consider their historical returns,their consistency,and that is what you have to bet on.And based on that thereare many other factorsthat I will share in this video,but NAV should not be a reasonto invest in a mutual fund or not,because that is not something thatdetermines the growth or the performanceof the mutual fund.Number 4:There is something called NFO,New Fund Offer.This is the equivalent of an IPObut for a mutual fund.Just as when a new company goes publicfor the first time, it releases an IPO,similarly, when a mutual fund goes public,it releases an NFO.Many people feel that NFO isa great time to invest.I don't think so,and there is a simple reason behind it.Just as you see in an IPO,the only objective that a company hasin an IPO is to getas much money as possiblefrom investors,whether it's corporate investorsor retail investors.Similarly, NFO has the same objectiveto get as much money as possiblefrom investors,whether it's corporate investorsor retail.Right now, their objective is notto give returns to anyone,that will only happenafter they get the money,their objective right nowis to get as much money as possible,and that means it will be orientedtowards the company, not you.If you give more and more moneyto that mutual fund,it means their valuation, their scale,their performance metrics,all that is made for them so thatthey extract the most money from you,not to give you better returns.So a good way to invest ina mutual fund is in a running mutual fund,where you have its historical data,you have its size which is called AUM,Assets Under Managementwhich means how many croresare invested in that mutual fund,you know its volatility which meanshow much does it fluctuateas compared to the index,and these should be the reasonswhy you invest in a mutual fund.I think it is better to stay awayfrom NFO because there are enough and morehigh-quality mutual fundsthat are running,and they have a historical benchmarkfor you to bet on them.Number 5:This is very important for 2023.Come what may, my friend,you will never stop the SIPsof mutual funds.Yes, there is only one reasonthat God forbid, you do not have money,but you will not stop becausethe market is low, returns are not good,you don't knowwhether to do it now or not,because the main purpose of SIPis to average out your price.Suppose you are buying a mutual fundwhose NAV is â¹10,then if you do a SIP of â¹100,you buy 10 units of it.If the same becomes â¹5 becausethe market is not performing,the market is down performing,a recession has come,or some problem has come in the growth,then you will buy 20 units ofthe same mutual fund for â¹100in the month you will buy it for â¹5.Now those 20 units are yours, my friend!So tomorrow when the marketwill come back,maybe these â¹5 will become â¹11 or â¹12,then you will have the same 20 units,but now their value will be â¹11 or â¹12,whatever the case is,and that is how SIPs help.If the price is â¹20,then you will be able to buyonly 5 units in that month,and that's perfectly fine as well.As you look at this entire SIPover a long period,you will see that it gives youan average cost which is a good wayfor you to invest.So come what may, don't stop your SIP.Number 6:I get so many emails where people say,Our SIP is going on,and these are all the mutual fundsin which we have invested,and there is a list of 12 mutual funds,a list of 8 mutual funds,â¹500 is here and â¹500 is there,â¹1,000 here and there,they have invested somewhere hereand somewhere there.Friend, diversifying is a good thing,but diversifying so much is stupid.Why?Because in the end, you have to seein which companyis this mutual fund investing in,and that is public data.So if you are invested in a mutual fundwhere they hold, let's say HDFC stock,and you buy another mutual fund thatalso holds HDFC stock,then you buy another mutual fund thatalso holds HDFC stock,then you are only holding HDFC stock,and that can also be done throughone mutual fund.So in my opinion, you do not need morethan 3-5 mutual funds,even 5 is too much,3 is good enough.I have invested in 3 mutual funds.One is Index Mutual Fund,one is Parag Parikh Mutual Fund,and another is Small Cap Mutual Fund.These are the 3 where I know my growthwill be good anywherebetween hopefully, 14-16-18% a yearcompounded overa very long period of time,and I'm very happy with that.That will be the way thatI would propose to you as well.Never buy a lot of mutual funds.Invest only in specific mutual fundsaccording to your risk, and you spread it.Here is my best suggestion.If you have â¹100to invest in mutual funds,and suppose you are in your 20s,a good mix for you will be,â¹65 or 65% of your mutual fund investmentor SIPs should go ina large cap index mutual fund.As I said,Nifty 50 is the safest and best.You can go for whatever you want,there is no recommendation,HDFC, SBI, whatever you want,all are almost the same.Nifty 50 index mutual fund,65% there.Around 20-25%in mid-cap index mutual funds.So there is also mid-cap in Niftyor National Stock Exchange,which are those companies which arebetween â¹7,000-20,000 crores of valuation,so you can invest in those companies.These companies are notas big as large-caps,but have a lot of growth potential,but due to that,there is a lot of volatilitymeans ups and downs.So you will invest only 20-25%.And the remaining 15-20%,you will invest in a small-cap index.Small cap index are the companiesthat have value less than â¹7,000 crores.They have massive growth potential,but since they are small companies,any macroeconomic trend or a recessionor Covid impact these companies a lot,whereas large companies are able towithstand that impact,so they will have even more ups and downs,but over a long period of timethey are likelier to give youbetter returns than mid-capand mid-cap is likelier to give youbetter returns than Nifty 50.So what are you doing with Nifty 50?You are achieving stable growth.With mid-caps, you're bringinga little bit of excitement,and with small-caps,you're bringing great growth,and that mix of 65%, 20-25%,and then 15-20% is brilliant,so that you get a pretty goodrisk managed portfoliowhich you can use fora long term perspective.This will be my way of doing it,but don't stop SIPs,and you don't need to invest inmore than 3-5 funds.Based on this number 7:Index mutual funds are betterthan sector mutual funds,because number 1,index mutual fundsare index mutual funds for a reason.Basically, they are trackingthe top stocks,be it Nifty 50, mid-cap 100,or small-cap 100.These are the top companiesin that indexor in that market capitalization,so it's tracking those companiesin the ratio of their market valuation.So it is almost always going to be betterthan investing in any sector mutual fund,whether it is a tech mutual fund,or industry or infrastructure mutual fund,or banking mutual fund,and so on and so forth.But my suggestion would be thatindex mutual funds are very good,and they will then ride the growthfor you in a fairly risk-managed manner,it cannot be risk-free thana sectoral mutual fund.Number 8:Mutual funds are not just in equity,there are debt mutual funds alsothat give you fixed income,as a fixed deposit gives.But if you want fixed income only,then put it in a fixed deposit only.There are many liquid mutual fundsor debt mutual funds,but their rate of returnis not as attractive as a fixed deposit,so according to me,use mutual funds only and only for equity.If you want fixed income,then invest in the National Saving Scheme,invest in a Provident Fundwhich is a Public Provident Fund,or of course, you can get a fixed deposit,or you can buy gold,that too is not fixed incomebut almost a predictable income,but use mutual funds for equitiesbecause you will invest for a long term,invest for 10-15-20 years through SIP,and that will createa brilliant wealth for youover that period of timeas against you going fora debt mutual fund or a fixed incomeor even mixed whereboth debt and equity are there,don't confuse that.There are a lot offixed-income instrumentsfor debt so take that,and use mutual funds for equity.And finally, hack number 9:If you have a lump sum amount,many people have a lump sum amount,and they wonder how to invest that.Please do not try to time the market.None of us is qualified to gaugewhen the market has reached its bottomand I should buy here,or I should sell when the markethas reached its top.It's a very difficult art,a very technical art,and at least I'm not qualified,so I wouldn't suggest it to anyone.The way that I would investlump sum amounts is to actuallyconvert that into SIP, that's my style.Whatever the lump-sum amount,let's say â¹100,I will make 60% of it in 6 equal SIPs,so I will do a SIP of 6 months.Suppose you want to invest â¹1,00,000,then I will say that I will starta SIP of â¹10,000 each,and run it for 6 months,and I will park the remaining â¹40,000,you can keep it in a fixed deposit,keep it in any instrumentwhere you have no exit load,means you don't have to payany penalty or any charge to get out ofthat fixed deposit, it is very important.Keep that â¹40,000 and wheneveryou feel that the market is very downand it can be a good time to buy,you will deploy that 40%,you will apply only that much mind.Here also as I am saying you will betiming the marketso most likely you will be wrong,but what you have still done is,you have invested 60% in SIP,and for the remaining 40%,you will try to time the market,so even if you go wrongwhich will most likely happen,then that 60% will take overand average out to give you a good price.That is how I invest my lump sum,and that is how I would recommend youto invest your lump sum as well.Do it in mutual funds, in equity,and for the long term.So these were the 9 hacksfor mutual fund investing.Which of these hacks will you use in 2023,please tell me in the comments section.If you
