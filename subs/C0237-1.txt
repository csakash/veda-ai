OkNow this is going to be a completely new settingHere is what I have doneSo first of all I have overexposed ita little bit Aditya, so you will have tobring down the color a bit, so thatI want the room to be slightly darkand the face to be lit, so I haveoverexposed it a bit, please reduce it.Shivam, there is more work for you,I have learned from you so I hopeyou are a good teacher and I am a good student.What I have done is, can you hear this sound?The sound of rain? So it's raining on therooftop so it will continue, I have keptone more recording which is just onthe ambient noise, so this will keephearing the ambient noise, unfortunately,this is also recording my own voiceso I have no mechanism to do anythingbut to keep it there. What I can perhapsdo is keep it far away, maybe that it will work.My voice will still be recorded Shivam,I don't think we can escape that butwe'll see how that goes and if that helps.And I am now going to give you 30 secondsso that you can measure my core ambient noise.Ok startingThere will be a few cuts in this video Adityabecause I am covering few separate topicsand I'll come to that, ok? Let's startAfter finishing my MBA, my first managerin my first assignment give me advicethat changed my life!What was that advice?We'll get to know in this video.Friends, I want more and more people towatch this video, so after watching thisvideo if you learned anything from it thenplease do not forget to share this video,like, and comment on it because this videois a foundation for a progressive,not just career but entire life.In this video, I will share with youthe advice which my first manager aftermy MBA shared with me. And what he said...No, I'll start againIn this video, I will share with you theadvice which my first manager, right aftermy MBA shared with me, whichchanged my life completely, it remainsone of the best life advice that I have got.And the more I think about this advice,it's been 15 years since I got this advice,the more I realize that this advice isnot only for professional lifebut it also applies to your whole life...AgainIn this video, I will share the advicewhich my first manager shared with meright after my MBA school, a piece of advicethat changed my life, and the more I thinkabout this advice, it's been 15 yearssince I got this advice, the moreI believe that this advice is not only fora professional career but for the whole life.Let's start the storyI finished my MBA, I did it from ISB,and there was one subject which I really hated,no offense but I never understood thatwhy does a subject like accounting existin this world. I good never understand accounting,where to debit, where to credit, why shouldwe do balancing. I had never done accountingin my life, I studied science all my life,so I hated accounting, and that's whyyou never excel at something you don't likeand you don't understand. So obviouslyI was not at all good in accounting.I was just waiting for this accountingcourse to finish, just get rid of itand I would move on in life becauseI never thought that I would ever beeven into anything related to accountingonce I have done my MBA.My MBA finished and I join a consulting firm,and in that consulting firm, my firstproject was in Dubai for a real estate client.This client had engaged us for aninternational expansion and they hadasked us to build an entire financial modelof all the projects that they wanted to undertake.And there was one project which thisDubai company wanted to do in India.They had bought a big land near Gurgaonand tied up with the local developerand wanted to launch a huge luxuryreal estate residential project,and we had to make a financial model for that.And who was selected to make this model?Ankur Warikoo!And the final details of this modelwere that after creating it and testing itwe had to propose if if that project wasfeasible or not, and for this an income statement,a balance sheet, and a cash flow statementwere important. Those 3 things which I alwaysused to avoid in my MBA and I was sure thatI will never have to face them again in my life,now they were in front of me and I was scared.This was my first job after MBA, naturallyI wanted to impress, I wanted that peopleshould know how smart I am, how hardworkingI am and so on and so forth, but accountingwas something that I just did not have thefundamental for. So I still remember,when I used to come back after my job at home,I started studying my accounting books fromMBA school to understand what exactly is it?How to recognize revenue in the income statement?How to recognize cost? There is somethingcalled deferred revenue anddeferred income recognition ina real estate project, and based on thatdeferred cost is recognized,there were so many fine details which I hadcompletely no idea about. And naturally,since I was learning all these things on the job,I was making a lot of mistakes,and at some point of time I realizedthat whatever I may do, I may not be ableto rise above his mistakes these mistakeswill always overshadow me.And I then made one of the biggest mistakesof my life from a work professional perspective.I told myself that whenever I make mistakesand I share my work with my boss for his review,then he takes care of my mistakesand he tells me all my mistakes,and then I make them right. This is great, right?Now, why do I have to review and reviewand fret, get stressed about the fact thatI should not make any mistakes. If he ischecking my mistakes, then let him do itand I will keep doing my work to thebest of my ability and whenever he wouldpoint out my mistakes I would correct themand give it back to him. This is how Istarted working. I remember it went onfor a month, I did my work, submitted it,my manager used to review it, there usedto be mistakes in it, lots of mistakes,innumerable mistakes, he used to tell meall the mistakes, I used to check and correctthem properly and give it back and the workwas done for that moment of time. Until wehad a conversation and at that point,he said to me, 'Ankur, whenever you sendyour work to me, and I have to find outmistakes in that work or there are mistakes,then I keep thinking that when I get yourwork next time, I cannot trust it, I willhave to review it again and then maybethere will be mistakes all over again,and if there are, then my belief thatthere were mistakes in this work yesterdaythat gets even more concrete. So what happensis that I am working at your level.You are not saving my time, in fact,you are taking away my time, because whenyou do your work and give it to me thenI have to spend my time in finding yourmistakes or to ensure that there shouldnot be any mistakes in your work.And the more I keep doing this then the workthat I have to do at my level,I will not be able to do that.'And then he said what I needed to hearHe said, 'Ankurit doesn't matter how smart you are,if I can't trust you,it doesn't matter how smart you are,if I can't trust you,It doesn't matter Ankur, how hard working you are,how intelligent you are, how talented you are,if I can't trust you then everything is a waste,they are of no use.'And when he said that,everything became clear,because in just a few words he said sucha deep thing that it struck me, this is it!The foundation of life is trust!If you really think about it,the entire civilization that we live in,how has it progressed?It has only progressed because one personcould trust another person. Since therewas no foundation for trust so we had tofind mechanisms to trust each other.If you really think about it, then money,what is money?Money is the best example of trustbecause you trust a piece of paper tobe â¹10 or â¹50 or â¹100 or â¹200,and you have no other thing working foryou to except the signature of the Governoron that note which says,'This 10 rupee note is actually a 10 rupee note,I promise this and I claim this', and that's it.That forms the basis for the entire worldto go after this piece of paper. And you willthen recognize how important is trust.Now how does trust change your life?What this advice did for me is that it changedmy perspective towards work. I realizedthat it doesn't matter how smart I am,it doesn't matter how long I am working,if the person in front of me doesn't trust methen all of these things are useless.So through my work, I have to generate trust,I have to create a trust mechanism becauseof which the person in front of me can say,'If Ankur has done this work, then I trustthat there would be no mistake in this work.If Ankur has done this work, then I trustthat he would have thought of all anglesthat he should have thought of, I may nothave even asked him to think of those thingsbut I am sure he must have thought of them.I trust that this person must have doneall the things that he should have done'.And then it goes a step forward.Trust is not only about that you willdo all the things that you must,but trust that if something goes wrong thenthat will be taken care of by itself,if something goes wrong then he would havekept everything in mind to make it right.And that builds the entire trust.This trust is important for relationships,it is important in work, it is importantto have trust in yourself.Do you trust yourself or not?Do you trust your emotions?Do you trust your thoughts?Do you trust your actions?Do you know how you are going to behaveor react in which situation?All of this forms the basis of trust,and through this video, I want to makeyou aware of this fundamental thing only,which all of you know, all of us knowbut still, despite that, we do nottake it seriously.Here are three ways through which youcan generate trust in your lifein front of someone else.Number 1, friends, when things are easy,when things are pleasant, the atmosphereis nice, then it is easy to bethere for someone.If there is a friend, a relation, manager,or work which you are enjoying, you aregood at it, it doesn't take much of your time,you don't have to dispense a lot of energy,it doesn't generate emotions,then it doesn't take a lot of effortto do that work or to take care ofthat relationship. So we all are ok with that.But trust is not built in these moments.Trust is built when things are difficult,when the way ahead is tough, that is whensomeone begins to trust you.So the best way to generate trust in peopleis to be there during their bad times.When they are going through a bad time,when they are seeking your help and your time,then to be there with them at that timeis what will generate the first levelof trust in them towards you.Number 2, we often think,and I also made this mistake,if I do something because of which,if I do something in which the chancesof mistakes would be less, I wouldmake lesser mistakes, I know it isnot the best of me but I know thatsomebody else will take care of iton my behalf, that is when we beginto lower the trust in people oppositeto us because they don't know ifsomething you can come out of anything,they don't know if you have doneall those things because of whichthey can be carefree because youwould have done everything.So, whenever you instead of reviewingyour mistakes, rely on someone else,you lessen down the trust.I can think of a beautiful story,that there was a sculptor who usedto carve stones and make beautifulsculptures out of them, and he hada desire to go on the top of a mountainand carve the stone there and dothe best work of his life.And he tells his friend,'I am going, it will take at least 2-3 months,I will stay there and sculpt that stoneon the top of the mountain and makea sculpture which I will be proud of'.And 2-3 months pass away, when hisfriend looks above from foot ofthe mountain, he can see abeautiful sculpture emerging,and he is very proud of his friend.And then one day his friend calledhim on top of the mountain and ask himto see his work. He goes thereand he sees the sculpture,it's a magnificent piece of art!Beautiful! Incredibly beautiful!And when he looks at it, it was a figureof a man doing something, I don't knowwhat it was. He realizes that the noseof the man in that sculpture wasslightly chipped, it was a little crooked,a little broken, and he tells his friend,almost like it's not a big deal that,'I have never seen such abeautiful sculpture but its noseis chipped a little bit'.And the sculptor, he looks at that,he realizes the mistake and then instantlyhe destroys the whole sculptureand his friend was like, 'Are you mad?It took three months to make this,I said its nose is chipped a little bitand you broke the whole sculpture?!Why did you do that?'And he is like, 'Because its nose was broken!'And he said, 'People are going tolook at it from far away down there,they won't even get to know of it.Nobody knows that its nose is chipped!'And then his friend says,'It doesn't matter that who knowsits nose is chipped because I knowthat its nose is chipped'.And that was his standard, that wasall that he craved about, that wasall that he stood for, that if I knowthat maybe there is a mistake in thisthen I will not stop finding that mistake,and when you do that you generatemassive trust in the person opposite you.And the third thing, you do whateveryou say you will do without anyoneasking you for a status update.You do whatever you say you willdo without asking for a status update.Often it happens that you sign up forsome work yourself, often your bossor your manager gives you some work,often in relationships the personopposite you asks you somethingor says something and you say yes,and you say that it will be doneby this time, I will do it by this time,I will take care of it by this time.If you complete that work by thattime without anyone having to ask youeven once that, is that work being done?Are you doing that work? You earn trust.But if someone has to ask you anytimethat are you doing it? Is this happening?Is it on track? That simply means theydon't trust you as yet. And if you arenot able to do it by the time you promised,and you are not even able to givean update that, is that work about tobe completed or not, you instantly lose trust.And that is the biggest problem.That we make big promises, many promisesbut we are not able to deliver.We are not able to deliver it as per the timeline.We are not able to keep the promise which we gave.And when that happens, we lose trust.Friends, if you close your eyes and thinkfor 2 seconds, then till the time theperson opposite you doesn't trust you,you may do whatever possible,you may say whatever possible,however smart you may be,however hard working you may be,it won't matter.Trust forms the basis of everything in life,and if you have these three mechanismsto generate trust,be there for people when times are tough,make sure that you are 100% accountablefor your own work,it is your own responsibility,and number 3 absolutely do whateveryou said you have done by the timeyou said you have done.You, my friend, would be sitting onthe biggest magical power that the world has,trust!I hope this was usefulI hope you are able to build trust in your life,in your relationships, in your work,just as meaningfully as my first managertold me how important trust is for everything.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
