Number 1: Blue chip stocks.These are the stocks ofvery stable companiesand large capital companies,and you know thatover a long period of timethese companies have performedconsistently.So you will observe their sale growthin the last 5 years,profit growth in the last 5 years,what is the ratio of their debtfrom banks in comparison to their equity,because if they are too much in debt,then it gets very difficult to pay offthat debt or pay its EMIduring a recession,all of those factors come into playwhen you pick these stocks.The idea is to invest in stable stockswhere you will not get phenomenal growth,but if you want to continue withthe investment during a recession,then these stocks would be a goodor perhaps a safer betas against random stocks likepenny stocks,or ones going through a lot of volatility.For example, if I go to market capand select only large-cap companies,which means only those companieswhose market cap ismore than 20 thousand crores,then I select the debt-equity ratioas a percentage,then I select the revenue growthin the last five years,and then I also select theirEBITDA growth or the profit growthin the last five years,and then I will make some decisions.So I will say that the debt-equity ratioshould be 50%,which means the debt is 50%to the total equity.Revenue growth should be at least 10%for the last 5 years.And then the EBITDA growthshould also be at least 10%.If I enter all these things,I get only 18 results.Only 18 among 4,500 companies listedon the stock exchange.And if I sort them by the revenue growth,then Bajaj, Adani,these are not recommendations,don't buy the stocks,this is just a 30-second work,stocks are not picked like this,neither am I an expert nor are you,it would be the stupidest thing to buythese stocks after watching this video,but I am just showing youhow this would work.Avenue which is D Mart, SRF,L&T which is a big infra company,Jindal Steels, Adani Wilmar,and this is how you would startto invest during a recession,in those companies which are stable,have been performing consistently,have performed well historically,and their debt-equity ratio is less.Number 2:You and I cannot pick stocks becauseas I have shown you,we found 18 stocks in 30 seconds,but they might not even be the right ones.I don't know, I genuinely don't know!So a great way to do that insteadis mutual funds.There is a manager in mutual fundswho takes the responsibility thatwe will manage it for you,just give us permission to beara very small cost for thaton your behalf,and then you can earn the returnsthat we will organize for you.And during a recession, the best,not really the best but the safest,even that would be wrong,but a safer option is index mutual funds.Try to understand that duringa recession market goes downbut over a long period of time,as always seen in the stock market,after a period of 5-10-20 years,the market consistently goes upover a long period of time,so it is your responsibilityto remain invested at this point,and invest in a mutual fundwhere are you knowwhen the market goes up,your investments will also startperforming,and those mutual fundsare index mutual funds.Index mutual funds have no sector,no specific stocks,the focus is not on growth and dividend,they only try to map the indexthat you have bought.My favorite index mutual fund isthe Nifty 50 index mutual fund,where the top 50 stocks of Indiacomprise the Nifty 50 index,and if any mutual fund triesto track the Nifty 50 index,then this mutual fund performsaccording to those 50 companies.And then my belief is thatthese 50 companies areIndia's top 50 companies,so in a way, they would be stable,growth would be good and consistent,they would perform as well,the performance may not be phenomenalbut it would be a stable performanceover a long period of timewhich is something that I would wantduring a recession.Number 3:Sectoral ETFs or sectoral mutual funds.A focus where you focus on a sectorand focus on its stocks.Again you are not the expert,at least I am not,so I cannot pick the stocks,I would rely on a manageror an expert to do thatbut I want to bet on a sector.For example, during Covid,some sectors prospered immenselyand some sectors were destroyed.Tourism, hospitality,all these industriesgot devastated overnight,but which industries started mushrooming?Technology worked really well,agriculture worked really well,pharma worked really well,biotech worked really well,and all of those were bets thatyou could have taken.How do you take this bet?By investing in a sectoral ETFor mutual fund.If you don't get this optionin a mutual fund or ETF,then smallcase has a lot of optionswhere you can makea sector-focused investment.You can invest in auto, pharma, IT/ ITeS,energy, logistics, infra, and so on.So your opinion would bewhich sector do I feel will performduring a recession,and then I want to invest in that sector,and the way to do that will be to workwith a manager who will manageyour mutual fund or smallcase or ETF.So, sectoral ETF, number 3,a way to invest during a recession.Number 4: Real estate.It has been historically seen thatif it is not a real-estate-led recession,then the recession remains stable.If the recession is because ofreal estate,like it happened in 2007-2008 in the USand then it spread globally,then naturally real estatewill underperform.But by and large, in all other recessions,real estate more or less remains stable.So you can consider real estateas an investment optionduring a recession.But what is the biggest problemwith real estate?It requires a lot of money.Where will you get 50 lakhs-1 crores,because we are beginner investors,and a great way to consider that is REITs,real estate investment trusts.Real estate companies float REITsThink of them as stocks,but the difference is that whateverincome these real estate companies earnthrough their rental income,that is represented in the REITsas a price.So in a way, you are bettingon the rental income of thatreal estate company,and the idea is that during a recession,it will be more or less stablebecause the companieswould have signed long-term leases,and they will continue paying those off,and whatever decision they tookwhether hybrid, work from homeor work from officebefore the recession started,then this rental income issomehow going to be stable.Right now there are 3 REITs in India.Embassy Office, Mindspace, and Brookfield.Another one might come soonwhich is around retail leasing.These 3 are office REITs right now,which means Embassy, Mindspace,and Brookfield, run office spaces,so the rental income of officeor commercial space is accounted for,but one REIT, I don't remember which one,is about to be launchedwhich is focused on retail,which means the real estate of malls,so that is also an option that you'd have.So this is number 4 of investingduring a recession.Number 5: Fixed income or dividend stocks.If you keep getting a regular incomeduring a recession,then that is the best thing,because somehow income gets a hit,becomes unstable, unpredictable,and unfortunately, some people mightget laid off, and during this periodif you have a regular incomethrough your investments,nothing is like that.So a fixed income, bonds,or something which gives youa guaranteed return.Fixed deposit is there, but of course,it is unable to beat inflation,so I would not recommend that.If you invest in EPF or PPF,it has a long lock-in of 15 years,so it's useless,it's not actually useless,it is of course very useful,but only after 15 years.So for the short term, corporate bondsis a great way for you to thinkabout fixed-income assets.What are corporate bonds?Companies that want to take a loan,but instead of taking it from banks,they go to retail investors and say,we will give you a rate of interestthat will be fixed, which meansit won't vary, it will be fixed,and it will be regularly dispersedevery 6 months or 9 months or a year,whatever that sync may be.It is risky too, because as I said,during a recession, a lot of companiescome under stress,so you will take the corporate bondof a company whose profileis extremely stable and very good,and to validate that there is somethingcalled a Corporate Bond Rating.The highest rating is triple-A rating,then comes double-A rating,so my advice or request would be,if you buy any corporate bond,buy the one which has a doubleor a triple A rating,don't consider anything lower than that,it can be very risky during a recession.A great platform to buy corporate bondsis wintwealth.comDisclaimer: I am an investorin Wint Wealth, so I am slightly biasedin suggesting that,but there are many other platformswhere you can evaluate, consider,and compare corporate bonds,and go about doing it.I personally invest through Wint Wealth,and I found that to be a great resourceto generate fixed income throughmy investments.Another way is dividend-yielding stocks.The stocks whose stock pricedoesn't grow rapidly or even consistently,but they regularly pay out dividends.What are dividends?When a company makes profit,it has two choices.Either invest the profit backin the company so that the company grows,or if they think the company has becomevery stableor the money doesn't have that much valuefor the company,then they distribute this profitamong their shareholders.That is called a dividend.If you are a shareholder in a company,no matter how many shares you have,and that company announces a dividend,it announces a dividend value per share,and you get that as an income.If you invest in dividend stocks,then you will regularly keep gettingthose dividends,and the best part is you won't haveto sell the stock for that.This is such a great way to startgenerating fixed income.So corporate bonds and dividend stocks,option number 5 to stay investedduring a recession.Number 6: Gold.I don't believe it, but it is often said,I mean experts say itso who am I to say no,they say that gold always remains stableduring a recession,and gold is a nice happy assetwhere you get a return of 7-8-9% annuallyover a long period of time.So you can invest in gold duringa recession because you willat least get inflation-beating returns.But what is the big mistakethat people make?They start buying jewelry asan investment in gold.Not a good idea!Why?Because it has making charges,it has wastage,the gold may not be pure as well,and all of those things makethe instrument,not a great investment option.The best way to buy gold isto buy digital goldor sovereign gold bonds.The Indian government issuessovereign gold bonds.It says as the price of gold increasesyou will get that return,but in addition to that,you will get a 2.5% extra returnwhenever you go for a maturitywhich can be after 5 years.Sovereign gold bonds are regularlyannounced but they are also tradedin the market.I just shared the name of Wint Wealthfor corporate bonds,it also gives you the option to buy SGBsthrough the secondary market,where you can compare betweena lot of SGB providersor the primary ownersand decide who hasthe highest yield or return,and then you can buy that.So gold is a good way to investin a recession, and that is number 6.And finally, number 7 which isdiversify, and diversify geographically.If you think that during a recession,your country will be greatly hit,then you should put your moneyoutside of the countrywhere the impact is not that much.Now, it will not be true forthe current recession because it seemsthat the current recessionwould be more in the US,but it is still an option for youto consider that you can investin the US stock marketwhile sitting in India.There are multiple ways of doing that.You can buy mutual funds in the USwhich are India-based mutual funds,but governing the US market,so they buy US stocks,and that is how they give you a return.I personally invest directlyin the US market using INDmoney.It is not a sponsored link,I am a customer of INDmoneyand an investor as well,so a disclaimer, I personally use itand that is why I have putmy own personal money into it,but through INDmoney,you can directly buy US stocksthrough your Indian bank account.It is parked with a US beneficiary.In my case, it is Drive Wealth.It is secured to the extent thatDrive Wealth has announced it isa registered body under the SEC,and INDmoney acts as the intermediary.The best thing is that the costsare very low,the exchange rates are very good,and I get visibility over allmy investments using the INDmoney app.So these are the 7 ways of continuingto invest during a recession.Bonus tip, and this is perhapsthe most important:It is often seen that during a recession,people stop investing, and I understandthat because your incomebecomes unpredictable, there's fear,there is unpredictability,just in outlook, but the best returnsover a long period of time are madewhen people consistently investirrespective of whether the marketis up or down.The best investors don't investwhen the market is up, they investwhen the market is down, becausethe first principle of investing isthat you buy low and sell high.People often do the opposite.They buy high, because they feelthat the market is going upand it is the right time to buy,and then they sell low,because as the market starts going down,they get afraid, and they fearlosing their money.If you are a smart investorthen you will keep investingduring this recession, becausethat is the surest and the smartest wayof making consistent returns overa long period of time.I hope this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
