Keep watching!First of all, how to gift Indian stocks?Zerodha, which is the partner thatI use for all my stock buying,they have recently introduced it,and I am so happy since they haveintroduced it that I have beenusing it actively.It is a simple process.The loop is slightly longerbut it is only to ensure that youare doing everything legally,and this is how the process works.Let's start the Loom videoIf you do not have a Zerodha accountthen you can use this link to opena Zerodha account.But it is important and mandatoryto have a Zerodha account becauseas far as I know it is transferredfrom Zerodha to Zerodha.I could be wrong but that'swhat I know of.So, I use Zerodha, and then someonehas to sign up using the same thing.How?You will go to your console.So, console.zerodha.com/giftIt displays gift stocks.And whoever you want to send the gift to,it is important that their mobile numberis the same through which they createdthe Zerodha account, becausethat is what is used to map the two.So for example, if I have to gift someone,I will enter,Testing123I will enter the mobile numberAditya, you will have to mask thisand the name of the recipients below this.Make sure that that happens.Mobile number, and then I will say,continue.When I continue, I will have a listof all the stocks that I have.It is very important to know thatyou can only gift those stocks whichare already there in your Demat account.If you have bought the stocks today,and they will come into your Demat accountafter the T+1 settlement, then youcannot gift those stocks to anyone.If you gift someone a stockand then sell it, it will be illegaland your account can be bannedbecause of that.Please don't do that!People are smart, you cannotbe smarter than them for now!So, it's important thatyou do it properly.For example, if I want to giftBata India to someone, then I willclick on it and I will just mentionhow many stocks I want to gift?I want to gift one stockand then confirm and send.When I confirm and send,then the person whose phone numberI have entered will receive an email,because Zerodha will first of all mapthat which Demat account is againstthis particular phone numberthat exists in their system.If it would exist then they wouldsend the email, and that email would read,'You have received a gift,please open to accept.'If they accept it, then you getanother email that reads like this,Aditya, here also you will haveto mark the name and all of this as well.So, you will get an email which says XXX,whoever you have gifted that stockto has accepted your gift.When you open it, this is thescreen that will appear,and you will have an option of,Approve giftThis is the process.So first of all, you confirmthat you want to gift something,they receive it and confirmthat they accept it, and then youagain get an email in which youhave to approve the gift.When you click on this, you aretaken back to your consoleand there you have to authorizefor this stock to be moved to theDemat account of the person to whomyou are gifting the stock.And for that, you basicallyhave to enter your CDSL T-pin.If you do not have it, then youcan generate it at that very moment.If you have it, then you can use it.And that will happen around a dayand you will then finally haveeverything that is needed.So as you can see here,I had gifted some people somestocks recently in September,one Reliance stock,so on and so forth, andStocks transferred,That is something that you can see hashappened from this Demat account.There is an approved list of allthe stocks that you can gift.You cannot gift every stock,so that is also available,and I will give you the link for that.And this is the simple processof gifting stocks in India.Problem!It is limited to India only.As far as I know, it is limitedto Zerodha only, I could be wrong.What if you want to gift stocksof US companies, there is nostraight way of doing that,until now.INDmoney which is one of the appsthat I use for my stock investinghas now introduced...SorryINDmoney which is one of the stocks...IND money which is one of the appsthat I used for buying and sellingUS stocks, they have introducedUS Stock gifting, which issuper exciting, and I wantedto talk to you about it.If you do not know about INDmoney,it is one of my favorite money apps,it is basically a super app.Through it, you can track allyour investments in stocks,in mutual funds.
