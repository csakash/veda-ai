3 biggest investing mistakesthat I made in my 20sand I would not want you to commit them.Number 1, I wasn't patient.I wanted to become rich overnight.So I made bad investmentswhere I could do'Get rich quickly!'But those almost never work out.Number 2, I invested out of FOMOor Fear Of Missing Out.I invested by following people.I invested by listeningto people's stories,which is almost alwaysthe wrong way of investing.And number 3, when my income grew,I grew my expenditureeven more rapidly.So I never had enough to invest.Honestly!A horrible mistake to make.
