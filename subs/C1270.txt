In 15 minutes,30 ways to earn incomeas a college student,or for that matter anytime in life.Friends, I recently postedin my YouTube community,if you are a college studentor a school student,then please share all the waysthat you are using to earn income.I received thousands of responses,and I have gatheredthe 30 most frequently given answersthrough which schooland college students earn money.This I figured, is not just limitedto school or college students,in fact, they were many people who said,'We are using some of these waysfor a side income along with our job.'So I feel that this video is broadly30 ways that you can createa side income in 2022.My goal would be to just sharethose 30 ways with you, and whereverI found a corresponding course,so that you can skill yourselfin that talent,I have linked a course from Udemy.Why Udemy?There is a selfish reason.If I share these links with you,and you buy a course through those links,then I earn an affiliate revenue,and 100% of that affiliate revenueis used towards the education of kidswho cannot afford it themselves.From January to December 2021,we provided help of â¹36 lakhsto students who could not affordthis education.This year that number is alreadygoing to double up, all because of you,so in case, you can buy these courses,then that would help somebody elsealso get an education, and in turn,you would also get a chance to earnthrough the side incomes that I have.30 side income options within 15 minutes,for you as a school or a college student,or a working professional.Let's get started.The first one is photography.If you can click using your phone,or if you have a DSLR camera,then photography could be a great wayfor you to earn a side income.Start with weddings, or birthday parties,capture events,and gradually create your portfolio,so that you can get paid for this.Photography Masterclass on Udemy,and Photography Basicsif you are using a DSLR,will be the two coursesthat I recommend for youto start on this journey.Second, if you are in collegeor even if you are working,then there will always bea demand for some productswhich is higher than the others.It could be shoes, belts, PS5,anything at all, you have to finda way of sourcing them,and because there is high demand,reselling them at a certain margin.This margin could be from 10-30%.This is something that you all told mein the response to that community post,that college students are actuallydoing this nowadays,so why not you!Number 3:If you are interested in studies,then you can take tuition classes.Not just for students in your batch,but for students who are in school,or a lower grade than you.This is how I earned money in my college.I used to take tuition classesfor physics and maths.I used to get anywherebetween â¹50-100 for an hour,which was a lot of money back then,and that paid for a lot ofmy living expensesor my discretionary expense.Even you can do the same.Number 4: In your class,help others with their homework,or help other studentswith their homework,irrespective of where they are.I don't know if you heard ofthis website called Chegg,C H E G G.comwhere you as a student can helppeople with their homework,and earn money.I know of a case, where I receivedan email yesterday itself,of somebody who was paid â¹8,250 in a monthfor solving homework on Chegg.Why not you?Number 5: Web3 is evolving rapidly.I am not talking crypto,I am talking about the foundationof blockchain and crypto.If you are interested in web3,then you can becomea web3 independent freelancer,and just help with web3 projects.A course on udemy which isthe Complete DApp course.DApps are decentralized appsthat are the foundation of web3,equivalent to the apps on our phones.And then there is another course which isBlockchain A to Z.It would tell you everythingthat you should know.After that, you can becomea moderator on Discord servers,you can help with DApp projects,you can help with web3 projects,and get a fancy stipend.Number 6: If you are interestedin fitness, then you can givefitness training to your class,your group, your community,or people online.That is such a great way to help others,and also make money.Especially nowadays, when peoplehave become so particular about fitness.To get equipped on that,Udemy has a courseComplete Fitness Trainer Certification,which will help you with the basicson how to approach yourfitness training business.And the second one isInternationally Accredited DiplomaCertificate in Fitness,which is a way for you to getprofessional about this journey.Number 7:If you are interested in music,then you can make a college band,or your own company band,and you can actually startmaking money through that.You can release your singles,that could be a way of marketing it.You can try to make those singlesgo viral on through IG Reels.You can work with othersto compose music for them.You can work on jingles,work on music projects.If you want to get trained in that,there is a course on Udemy,Successful Music Marketingand Branding for Artists/Bands,which can be a great start for you,and theComplete Band Management Course.It's amazing that these coursesare available on Udemy,which is somethingthat I would have never figured.I wish I had these courses in my time.Number 8: I did this too.As a college studentor even as a working professional,you can become a part of events.You can be a part ofevent organizing committees,you can become a host in an event,you can become a helperor a volunteer in an event,and all of those are great experiences,but also come with a stipend.I remember, for some events,I used to get â¹500 a day,which was more moneythan I could ever imaginein my life back thenwhen I was 18 or 19 years old.A course on udemy,The Complete Guide to ProfessionalEvent Planning Management,where you can conceptualizeyour own event, and market it.And Succesful Events: Event Planning,Marketing, and Management,which is another coursethat helps you in the same direction.Number 9: Call centers.They have been there for many years,they are still there,their nature of work has changed,it is much higher in its quality,you are speaking to internationalas well as domestic clients,and it is a great experience,because you not only focuson your speaking skills,on your communication skills,but your interpersonal skillswith respect to your work placeand your work colleaguesalso improve significantly.You can choose your hours,you can do it along with your college,along with your work,and be in control of your time.The Call Center Training:Getting Started with a BPO Job,is a course on Udemy for that, andThe Call Center Essential Guide,is also a course that can help youexactly with that.The links to all these coursesare in the pinned commentand in the description,so if you click on them,and you make a purchase,I earn affiliate revenue,and 100% of it goes towardsthe education of kids who cannotafford it themselves.I would love for you to help others,and also help yourself in the journey.Number 10 is a very interesting option,which is especially emerging nowadays.Voice over artists.Different types of voicesare required for dubbing,for production,and for a lot of videos as well,and a lot of people are volunteeringfor this and making good moneyfrom this process as well.Voice-Over Training: Record And EditVoice Overs Like A Pro.This is something that you can do.There are innumerable voice-over artistson Fiverr,you can list yourself there.and start earning a very handsome amount.Number 11: Translator.A lot of people look fortranslation services.We look for them.Our videos are in Hinglish,our subtitles are in English,so we need someone who understandsboth Hindi and English,and when I say 'imagine that'or 'with passion',they understand what that means,and convert that intoan English language subtitle,which then can be used in a video.We need these people, we actuallywork with freelancers and interns,who we pay a fairly handsomesum of money every monthto get this done.Why not you?If you are interested in this then,How to Become a TranslatorWithout a Degreeis a great course on Udemy,and How to Become a SuccessfulFreelance Translatoris another course that you can pick up.Number 12: Proofreading.Proofreading is when you read a document,and proofread that document for errors,for punctuations, and even for facts,if necessary.This is for those professionswhere there is a lot of documentation,and then they need peoplewho are mostly college students,or young working professionals,to go through these documentsand say, 'a full stop is missing here','a comma is missing here','this word is misspelled','this sentence doesn't have a good flow',so on and so forth,and get paid per page to make that happen.You could also be translating,which is the previous one that we said,and picking up a documentin some other language, translating it,and proofreading it in a languagethat they want you to.If you are a language student,both of these are great ways for youto start earning a happy income.If you want to proofread, thenProofread Like a Pro isa great course on

busy,they receive a lot of emails,or influencers for that matter,who receive a lot of commentson their content,and they need someone to replyto those comments, to reply to emails,to reply to business queries, and so on.They need somebody to bemanaging their calendar,and that is called beinga virtual assistant.These jobs are available dime a dozen.You can go on Upwork,you can again go on Fiverr,list yourself, and becomea virtual assistant for anyoneacross the world,and perhaps even earn in dollars.Number 14: If you live in a small city,and please do this in small citiesbecause it's a lot of hard workin big cities, if you are in a small city,then you can actually opt to becomea delivery associatefor all the delivery appsthat are there in the market today.Whether it is Dunzo, Zomato, Swiggy,Zepto, and so on and so forth.I mentioned small cities becausedistances are short, traffic is less,there is less mental stress,and you can actually in a few hoursmake a reasonable amount of money,and be in control of your time as well,so that you spend your timeon the right things,and you also earn money in your free time.Number 15: Data entry.Data entry is a job where

something you can doin your free time as well.I would not suggest a cloud kitchen,I used to but not now,because it needs a lot of involvement ofenergy, of time, of managment of people,but baking is somethingwhich you can do yourself,with your interest and desire,at your own time,it doesn't require infrastructure,and so on, and you can also makevery happy money through this.If you are interested in bakingthen a Baking Bootcamp,which is a great course on Udemy,could be a good start for you.Number 17: If you are interestedin sports, or you are generally athletic,then you can teach sportsto the kids in your neighborhood.There are so many kids who wantto learn tennis, football,or just general enthusiastic games,some sort of karate, so on and so forth,not sort of, karate is a very legit game,then you can be the one teaching them.It is a brilliant way to connectwith kids, and if you can teachsomething to kids, frankly,you can teach anything to anyone.Definitely consider that,if you are good with sports.Number 18: College canteenor even a work canteen.If you have a 24/7 routine,or you live in a hostel,or you work in the office for late hours,then you can start a 'canteen'but with permissions.Maggi, biscuits, Frooti, juice,Thumbs-up, whatever the case may be,these can be things that you sell.Sell them for even a small premium,because people need itat that point in time,and there is no other wayto get it delivered,because nobody else would deliversuch small or cheap items,and you can become thier Dunzo.Number 19: Notes maker.Who are they?In coaching institute,there are many classes,and they want to make notesand give it out to students.But who makes those notes?Somebody like you.You will be sitting in that class,attending it for free,which is mostly the case,plus you will get paidto make those notes.So if you know how to make notes,you can pay attention,and you can convert that verbalinto a text format which is consumable,then you my friend,can make a great income through that.Smart and effective notesusing Note 2010is a great course for youto get started on Udemy for this.Number 20: Preparationfor international exams.If your verbal and maths is solid,then international examslike GMAT, GRE, SAT,you can give coaching for that.Usually, these coachingsare very expensive if you goto a professional institute,but if you start yourown coaching through books,and through your experience,then you can actually taketuitions of kids across the world,and train them on international exams.Why not?Number 21: Paper checking.Remember your teachers who usedto check the papers,and they used to get paid for it.You can be the same person.Coaching institutes keep takingsome of the other exams,most of these exams are not automated,or graded automatically,so they need checkers,and you can become one of them.You will get a grading sheetso that you exactly knowwhat you are checking,and on what basis are you supposedto give marks.That will

that you can doin your spare time and make money.Number 25: Become a poker player.Poker by definition and law,is not considered a game of luck,it is a game of skill,which is why I am sharing it.I would never suggest gambling,I would never even suggest training,because that also becomes,while it is a game of skill,but very very risky.Poker, on the other hand,could make you a greatmoney-making machine if you do notget addicted to it,and please don't get addicted to it.If you want to learn Poker,then the Crush Micro Stakes Online Poker,this is a good course to startwith on Udemy, and
