I've made this title sensational,Become a millionaire, best way to do that!It's a lie!You can leave this video now because,in this video, I will not give any tipsto get rich overnight,in fact, I will tell you the waysby which you can actually earn money,because many interesting thingsare happening in 2023which may not happen again in life.Even if they do, they will be very rare.And smart people follow these trendsand deploy their time, money,and experience in the right directionin order to set them up for success.So in this video, I am going to sharemany ways which are unique for 2023and if you start capitalizing on that,then genuinely over a period of timeyou can earn millions of rupees.I am not kidding!Number 1:Invest in the US market.A very important disclaimerbefore we start.I will give a few financial advices whichis not a professional financial advice,so please do not take them at face value.This is my interpretation ofwhat is going on in the worldand what am I doing for myself,but it is not important for youto follow these things.Number 1:Invest in the US market.The US market has gone througha major correction in the last year 2022,particularly in the tech industry.So the best stocks like Amazon,Google, Facebook or Meta,and Tesla are going through a bad time.I made a video onmy investment performance of 2022,where you saw that my best stocksare down by 50% or 60%,but what that means is there isan opportunity because all these companiesare tech companies,which means they are going to controlhow the world shapes up in the future,and this level of correction is very rare.I remember that this kind ofcorrection happened last in2007-2008 financial crisis,and before that in the year 2000when the Bubble Burst happened,and this is perhaps another opportunity.It is happening after a very long time.For all of you,may be the first time ever,so it is very important to capitalizeon this opportunity,and the best way to do that,if you want to invest in the US market,then start with SIPs,if you want to investin the tech industries, then there isan ETF called QQQ, invest in it.Don't pick particular stocks becausewho knows which stock goes up or down,so a portfolio of stocks is always good.I particularly use INDmoneyfor investing in US stocks.This video is not sponsored by INDmoney,but I am invester an INDmoney,so my opinion is biased.There are many other apps thatallow you to invest in the US market,you can do your research and choose them.But please do consider investingin the US market because this opportunitymay not come again.Number 2:Cloud kitchens.I have a firm belief that food deliveryis going to explode in Indiain the next 3-5 years,but in a very different manner.Nowadays most of the deliveryis by the top brands.McDonald's, Domino's, KFC, Burger King,Pizza Hut, Biryani,but what is going to happen isas we have more of a young population,and they start to earn,and they will also be single,they will get married late,and they will not have the flexibilityor the time or even the willingnessto cook food themselves,they will start ordering.So the order value will start decreasingbut the frequency will start increasing.And that means you will find yourselfordering multiple times a week.A cloud kitchen in that isa great business to build.Cloud kitchen is not a restaurant.It is not a place where customerscan come and eat.It is only and only a delivery outlet.You can run multiple stores throughone cloud kitchen.In a single kitchen,you can cook Chinese food, Indian food,continental food,whatever the case may be,and that gives you economies of scale,it gives you great frequency, of course,it is a lower margin becauseyou have to give a margin toZomato and Swiggy as well,you have to take outyour own cost as well,and then, of course,you have to make a profit as well.But it could be a great investmentto make over a long period,because my prediction is that 2023is the tipping point.People have gone through Covidfor 2-3 years, they were homeso they weren't doing as much.Now when they have started working again,they are going back to office,but they are also realizing thatthey are short on time,and they want to be driven by convenience,so food delivery is going to explode.Number 3:Commercial real estate.Many people thought that because of Covid,work from home will become a phenomenon.It did,and to a great extent!But what also started happening isthat commercial real estate,not necessarily offices,but shared or coworking spaces,of course, hotels, retail,and the infrastructure aroundoffice buildings also,everything started exploding.So if you have a way of gettinginto commercial real estate right now,that could be a great way of doing it.But the issue with commercial real estateis that the ticket sizesare usually very high,and everyone does not havethat flexibility.So a good way of replacing that is REITs,Real Estate Investment Trusts,where you invest in a projector multiple projects of a companythrough a REIT,and you get regular growthor appreciation throughtheir rental income.This is a safer and better wayof doing it as against investingin real estate because you don't lockin a large amount of money.You can start investing inreal estate with â¹500.All REITs in India arecommercial real estate which is great,so you get a good rental income,the yield is good, you can buyor sell whenever you want,so there isn't a liquidity problem.So it is a nice happy way of doing itas against buying a shop or officewhich is not possible for all of us,but 2023 could be a great place to start,because commercial real estate is goingto explode, occupancy will increase,there will be major growth in the economy,and all of that will needcommercial real estate.Number 4:Start a business.And I say this because most likely 2023will be a recession year.Many economists are predicting this.It may not be a lot in India but still,a slowdown will be there.This is usually the best timeto start a business.Why?Because the other startups havealready taken a lot of funding,faced a lot of losses,they have started doing major layoffs,so they will be highly distracted,their morale would be really low,and they will not be able to enter marketwith the same kind of aggressionas you who is a new player.Usually, the best companiesare made during recession times,because there is less noise,funding is not insane,so it's not like the competitionor a founder has got a lot of moneyand you are game is over,you get a lot of timeto correct your mistakes,and the market is also not going crazy,so it's not like your customersare spoilt for choices,if you build something good,they are attracted towards you.So a recession is usually a good timeto start a business,and 2023 could be one such opportunity.In the last 11-12 years,there hasn't been a recession,at least not as fiercely as peopleare predicting for this year,so this could be an opportunityof a lifetime.Number 5:This is one of my favorite ones.In the last 1-2 years,there has been a mega revolutionthat is very silently changing our world,and that's artificial intelligence.Work has been going on for years on this.Artificial intelligence has been somethingthat started in the 1970s, late 1960s,1980s, but in the last 2-3 years,there has been an almostleapfrog revolution.A tool like Chat GPT on whichI made a video last week.It's just revolutionalizing everything.Now what that means for youas a money generator is maybefor the first timein the history of the world,there is an opportunity where technicallywithout any skill, you can becomea freelancer.You can become a content writer,a music producer, a lyricist,a storyteller, a social media manager.You can actually do so many thingsusing AI tools without knowinghow to really do them,and this is fascinating.If you are a college student,a working professionalwho wants to make some side income,and you want that passive incomethat can help you investand grow that money even furtherand so on,then AI tools are a revolutionthat will change your life.So please try to understandAI tools in 2023,and then through them start a side gigthat will help you generate moneythat you can use wisely going further.Number 6:As a content creator, if you wantedto win the content game,then there was only one way to do it.Create good content consistentlyfor years,gradually you will have a following,your subscriber base will increase,and then through that, your contentwill become big.This is the game that every single onehas played.Whether it's Mr. Beastor Sandeep Maheshwari,everyone has played this gamewhere they have been at it for years,but something has now changed,short-form content.When you see Reels and Shorts,for the first time in the worldthere is a tool where you can go viralon day one.Your first Reel or Shortcan acquire millions of viewson the first day itself,because there are so many peoplewho are consuming short-form content.And that means for the very first timein history,you have a shot at competingwith every big player out thereon day one itself.It has never happened beforein any industry,but it is happening in content.So I am actively telling peopleto create short-form content.Create it, and then please test itwith full dedication,release it every day because one dayit can go into thousands and millionsof views,and after that day, your game will changeas long as you are consistent.Consistency is important,but consistency not anymorefor 16-18 months or 2 years,but the consistency of keeping on doingwhatever you are doing that madeit work for you on the first day itself.That's it!It's a home run, game, and you have won.You actually have a chance of gettingas big as every big creator in the countryor the world just by consistentlycreating short-form content.Try that!Number 7:And this change is also coming now.Because a lot of people are consumingshort-form content,and short-form contentis now becoming monetizable,so you see ads while watchingInstagram Reels,YouTube Shorts will also have adsstarting from 1st February,and that means that digital marketingis making a comeback.Its not that digital marketingdisappeared,but people thought that digital marketingis not cool, it's a waste of money,but nothing like that.I am one of the very few creators in Indiawho use digital marketing aggressivelyto promote my business of courses,while I maintain my content businesswhere there is never any promotion,I don't even run ads on my channel.So the way to think of this isif you have anything to sell,whether it's courses, merchandise,books, music, or anything else,you now can use digital marketingin a way as never before,because what you have ismassive consumption, addictionof short-form content,and because of that, a really cool wayof promoting whatever is it that you want.Digital marketing is making a comeback.Number 8:Crypto.I don't know how you feel about crypto.I am for crypto, not because it's cryptoand you can make moneyovernight through it,but because I believe in the technology,I understand that technology well,and I genuinely believe that cryptois the future.But crypto has gone througha lot of correction in 2022,and this is now again a chance for youto come back at levelsseen last in 2017-2018.This means you can really claw back5 years of gain in just this one year.A big disclaimer here:Please please don't go crazyand invest all of your moneyor a large part of your moneyin only crypto.The guidance is thatno more than 10% ever,and ideally 5% of your total investmentsshould be toward crypto.I had a goal of getting to 1 Bitcoin,10 Ethereum, and 100 Solana,and I have already completedthis goal this year,and I am really happy about that,and now I will sit on it.To accomplish this goal,it cost me around â¹36 odd lakhs,and at least my belief is,I could be completely wrong,that in the next 10 years,this will be for about 3 million dollars,which could be anythingaround 20-25 crores,and that is the bet that I am going for.But if it doesn't work out,I am actually okay to losethese â¹36 lakhs,because it is less than 5% ofmy total investment,and that is why I still remain invested.This is the same thing that you have to doas well if you want to invest in crypto.But I do believe that 2023 could bea brilliant time to start investingin crypto if you haven't done it already.Number 9:Invest in the Indian stock market.I think 2023 will be a brilliant timebecause the world will go througha recession,India might not face that recession,but India actually will go far fasterthan most other marketsif not the fastest market in the world,and this will be a phenomenonof 10-20-30 years.So if you have never invested to date,when there is no need for you to gotowards the US.Indian stock market will give youeverything that you need.A person will have to be insanely stupidto not earn money inthe Indian stock market.You can start a SIP regularlywith absolute dedicationor a mutual fund or a smallcaseor anythingwhich is a portfolio of stocks.Do not pick stocks,because maybe you do not havethe experience, at least I don't,I don't have the expertise as well,so I don't pick stocks,I invest in a portfolio of stocks,whether it's mutual funds,whether it's smallcase,and because of that you will be ableto build a brilliant sustainable incomefor the future, but be consistentand regular for it.And then finally number 10:Since 2023 might be a recession year,it could be a great time for youto actually take a gap year.A gap year is not taken only bya school or college student,every person can take a gap year,whether you are a working professional,whether you are a school ora college student,and you are not too sure whetherwhat you're doing is what you want to dofor the rest of your life.And a gap your could be a wonderful wayto disconnect, learn a lot, explore a lot,and then come backwhen the market is back.Often people go to studyin a recession year,but I feel even studying iskind of bindingbecause you can only studywhat you have chosenas a course or as an institute,but if you take a gap year,then you can do internships,online courses,become a member of clubs and forums,you can study by yourself,create something,try a startup business,whatever it is that you feelyou can invest towards,because if you makethe right investment here,towards your knowledge,towards your experience,towards your learning, it could changethe course of your life.2023 will be a very unique year,there will be many exciting opportunities,and through these 10 opportunities,I believe that whatever you chooseamong them,you will set yourself up for creatingbrilliant wealth for yourselfover the long run.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
