As you can see, this is a wonderful space to be in.There is a lot of light.There is a great expanse. It's almost feels like the mind opens up,and all these things are veryimportant for productivity.If you are sitting infront of a wall, then how yourthoughts are just hittingthe wall and not moving forward,or if you are sitting infront of a big glass windowwhere you can see just trees andlight for as far as you can see,and you let your thoughts fly,you let your creativity fly, and that is what I love about this.There is one more particular thing. I use a back rest for my back, because this is a dining table chair.So, itâs not meant tobe a working chair.But this is also a good example that to become productive,the tools used by theproductivity ninjas,for which they make videosand keep annoying you, not necessary.Of course, if you can afford it, and if you would want it, and if you have the space for it,go for it, but a dining tablecan also be made a working table. What is required is for you to have a discipline that you want to be productive,and the ambience that makes it happen.
