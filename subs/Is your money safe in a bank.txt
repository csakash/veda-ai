Okay, Piyush a little bit of this,Will start it a little dramatically.And let's see how it goes.Suppose one day you go to your bank,to withdraw money from your account.And the bank saysthat they don't have your money.What?The bank doesn't have your money?How is that even possible?Is it possible that your bankin which you have deposited your moneythroughout your life,have made fixed deposits.Deposited in current account.Have invested through it.That money disappeared overnight?It's just not there.You can't even access that money.The answer is yes.And in this video, let's try to understandhow does this happen,Not because it's about to happen,but it is always necessary to know thisfor a vigilant citizenthat how do things eventually work.In this video,taking the example of the recentincident of Silicon Valley Bank, SVB,I will try to show or explainhow the money kept in your bankmight disappear.And through that make you awarewhat is it that you should do about it.First of all, let's try to understandwhat happened with Silicon Valley Bank?Silicon Valley Bankis a very interesting bank.This is a US bank.Which are specifically made for start-ups.So this is in Silicon Valley.A lot of start-upsdo their banking with Silicon Valley Bank.So like if you open your salary accountin HDFC, or in SBI, in ICICI,or anywhere else.Or if you have a businessthen you will also openyour current account in these banksWell most of the start-upsthat were based in USthey used to open their banking accountwith Silicon Valley Bank.But something happenedin the month of March.In March 2023,Silicon Valley Bank made an announcement.That announcement was very simple.But they had no idea,due to this announcement,what is going to happen.They made this announcementthat they had made some investmentsand now we are breaking those investmentat a loss.I am very roughly,telling you things at a high level.Because by getting into the intricacieswon't get ourselves technically confused.But I'll go deeper whenever it's required.They made this simple announcementthat we had made some investments,and now by breaking those investmentswe are recovering that money at lossand overnight,people started withdrawing moneyfrom that bank.And there came a time when SVBhad to stop the withdrawals.They instantly stopped the withdrawals.Because they just had no moneyto pay the peoplewho wanted their own money back.And what happened thereafter?After this, SVB Bank instantly shut down.What? The 12th largest bank of US.Wasn't a small bank.It was not some bank across the street,like Warikoo Bank. No.Its a really big bank.Itâs a very prestigious bank.It has been running for a really long timeand it caters to the highest, best-knownstart-ups in the US and the world.Shutdown overnight.What happened next is,US Government body decidedto sell SVB to a buyer.Basically, some other bank,which would it buy it.So that they take over then,the customer relationshipsand the deposits, etc.and will try to save it.That process as of today,when I am shooting this video is still on.Because until now,they have not found that buyer.Now what happens, who knows?But in this whole story,the learnings that come out,I want to share that with you.Let's start.When a bank openswhat is the business model of the bank.The business model of the bankis very simple at the fundamental levelis very simple.It has two objectives.Number one:Bring money from people to the bankand how does it do it?It basically saysif you keep your money with our bank,we will give you an interest.So like on your banking account,on savings you get 3-4% interest.Or if you open an FD with that bankcan also get 4, 5, 6%.Probably even more.So in that way it inviteswhat are called depositors.Basically, people like uswho deposit their money in that bank.And this comes in plenty.More better the bank,the more better the status.More better the products,the more regular flow of moneykeeps coming in.Which was also happening with SVB.In 2020-2021 all SVB start-upswere raising so much fundingthat all the money was coming to SVB,was getting deposited there in their bankand SVB gave them a rate of interest,which is very less, because in the USyou get very low rate of interest.And that was the first sideof the equation.But now that money has come,I am also paying interest on that money.So where will this money come from?How will I make money?What is the business model?So the business modelis the money that has come,I have to give back the same moneyas loan to people.It could be the same peoplewho have deposited the moneyor it could be very different people.Suppose you deposited â¹100 in your bank,then you said I want to buy a house,I want a loan of â¹50,so bank says absolutely.Take this loan.Now how much moneyare you getting for your â¹100?3-4%, even if FD is done, then 5-6%.How much is the home loan interest?8-8.5%, this resultant differencethat is what the bankmakes as its own money.With this they pay all their salaries,carry out their expenses,and make their profits.And this then happens not just to us,but even to businesses.So you deposited your â¹100.Many people deposited â¹100.Reliance or some big Tata Group came.They said mate, we do need â¹1,000,want to open a factory.They say, take this â¹1,000.And you give them and they say,we'll give this at 10%.So you took the money as a bank,gave 3-4% to us and gave loan to them,and you gave that at 8, 9, 10%.The difference, which is called the spreadis what the bank makes.And that is the business model. Simple.So the business model of the bankis mostly dependent on a risk.And that is called credit risk.That if I gave a loan to someoneand God forbid that person ran awaywith the money and I failed to find him.I didn't even give them any collateral.Means, I had not takenany collateral from them.Also did not make to pledge anything.So, the money disappeared.Got exhausted.That is called credit risk.So the value of a bank is establishedBecause they give loans to good people.As much as the bankgives loan to bad people,those who should have not got a loan,those who are ineligible for loans,don't have the income to repay the loan,the more the bank will become risky.But a bank that gives each and every loanafter thorough scrutiny and understandingAsks for thousand documents from themwhen you give a loanand you say man so many documentsare to be signed.Means want ITR also,want a bank statement also,then a deposit here, a deposit there.This declaration, that declaration.Why do they ask for this?Because they are determiningyour credit worthiness.How high is your abilityto pay back this loan.That is also determinedby your credit rating.I had made a video on CBIL Score.What CBIL Score saysis all the loans you have taken till datehow well have you repaid themor are still paying.And the better you have done it,the higher is the credit rating,the worse you have done,is defaulted on EMI. Did not pay.Had a small credit card balancethat stayed pending,and then it became very huge.All of these thingslower down your credit rating.So this becomes the big riskthat the bank has to take.But in SVB's case they took another risk.Which most banks do not take.Remember they used to work with start-ups.Start-ups get a lot of funding.But start-ups do not need loans.Because they are getting funding.so they are living on fundingmaking merry on funding.Are spending on basis of funding.Why would they need a loan?Nor do they usually have to open factoriesnor do they have to buy anything else.They just have a salary, technology cost,So within that, which is their funding,from there itselfthe gradual expenditure keeps happening.So SVB had a very interesting problemthat their money was easilycoming into the bank,but was not moving out.So there was no way for themto actually give out loans.Because if another corporateor any other individualwould like to take loan from SVB,so why would he take it from SVB,he would take it from somewhere else.Will take from some big bank.Will take it from some regular bank.Why would he take it from a start-up bank?Like you will not take loanfrom Warikoo Bank.You will take loan from ICICI,HDFC, SBI all such good places.Won't take loanfrom any random Warikoo Bank,Because you might not even get that loan.So that way SVB had this problemwhere to deploy this money.So what they did in 2020-2021,is they depositeda large part of their assets,56% to be precise.In the most secure investmentthat is out there, US Treasury Bills,US Treasury Bills are like fixed depositsWhich is announced by the government.So the government says, mate.Even for us to run that business,business means to run the country.Not business,to run the country money is needed.From where will we get that money?It comes from tax,it comes from somewhere else.But even we can run an FD of our own.So we run our FDs,which are called treasury billsin the Government of US.And those treasury billsare long-term treasury bills.10 years, 15 years, 20 years.So SVB took an FD of 10 years.And what happened?As 2022 was coming to an end,interest rates started rising.This 10-year FD that SVB had takenfrom the governmentit was taken at around 1.5% interest.Means whatever money they had deposited,they used to get 1.5% on them.Far lesser than that,they had to give to their depositors.So a great game is going on.0.5% interest is to be paid,to who have deposited all the money.We are getting 1.5%,where we have invested.The world is very happy.There is a spread of 1%.But in 2022, as soon asinterest rates started rising,The matter got reversed.Because now the same 0.5%you had to pay for deposits,now has increased to more than 1.5%.Which means, you now have to havemore interest paid to your depositorsthan you are earning on your investmentsSo for the money in your bank,you are paying extra interestand what you're earning from that money,is lesser than that. Squashed.Over and above that,a recession was starting,global weakening was beginning,so the funding also stoppedand because the funding stopped,all the start-up said,the money we had deposited in the bank,let's start using that more.So your depositsalso started getting withdrawnto the pointthat you are not getting more depositsand on whatever deposit you have,you are losing money every day.Because you are giving themhigher interest and you are getting less.And at some point of time,SVB was like, mate,we have to break this 10-year FDwhich we had taken.And when you break ityou do it at a loss.Because you are breakingthat 10-year-old FD.When they announced thatpeople felt that they have no moneyand instantly all the venture capitalistswhose portfolios and start-upshad invested money in SVB,all of them told their start-ups,get money out of SVB.But here comes the big thing in banksif your money is in some bankAnd assume that there are a totalof 100 customers in that bank.If at any point 100/100 customerscome and ask for their money backthen that bank will not have that money.I'm saying this once more,because this would be socking,If you deal with one such bankwhere there are 100 customersand 100/100 customers at the same timeask for all their money back from the bankso that bank will not have money.Not because they are doing fraud.Not because they are not runningthe right business,because they took your moneyand gave it to someone else for loan.And that loan is for 5 years,7 years, 10 years.So it is only going to come backover a period of time.If you asked for all that moneyback today itself,the bank does not have the money.So instantly when all the start-upsplaced a request with SVBasking for money.And they were online,all those requestsstarted getting rejected,because they didn't actuallyhave that moneyand that led to what's called a bank run.A bank run is when people emotionallyor fear-wise or actuallytry to remove their money out of the bankbut almost every customeris doing it simultaneouslyat the same time.And when that happens,the bank does not have the moneyto give everyone and it collapses.This is not somethingthat we would ever want for our money.So now the question arises,that is your money safein your bank or no?And the reality is, it's mostly safe.Is safe 99.9999%.Because those banks are very big.RBI regulates them very tightly.There are lots of checks and balancesin place.But it is also important to knowthat as per the governmentIf God forbidsomething happens to your bankthen your insurance is only up to 5 lakhsWhich means irrespective of the amountthat you have in the bankYou are insured only up till 5 lakhs.Principal and interest included.This is across all products of the bankSo you can have FD in that bank,can be current account,can be savings account,doesn't matter.All put together,any amount of money it comes to,you are insuredonly up to 5 lakhs out of that.The only way that you havemore than 5 lakhs insuredis if you go into multiple banks.Because 5 lakhs are insured in each bank.But not on every single product.So all the products you've done in a banka sum total of all,is only 5 lakhs insured.But each individual bankhas separate insurance of 5 lakhs,And that is the only protectionthat you have as a customerin the Indian banking industry.Do not be afraid of thisbecause as I saidthe financial system is very robust.RBI has done a great jobAcross all these years to ensurethat the bank cash ratiois at a very good level.That if too many peopletry to withdraw money at the same timeSo that much cashwill always be with the bankAnd a bank run is somethingthat is largely emotional in nature,that lines have stood in front of the ATMOr people online through NEFT or IMPS,are trying to transfertheir money here and there.If that happens concurrentlyAny bank even the best of the bankswith the best of the intentionsand the best of the business models,that whole money will not be there.So it's important for you to understandWhat happened with SVB,why did it happen,and can it happen with you or not?In India a body called DICGCmanages all these things.Deposit Insuranceand Credit Guarantee Corporation.This is the body which insuresyour 5-lakh insuranceand all of this is paid forby the bank itself.You never have to pay anything for this.Every single thing is paid forby the banking industrybut it's important to knowThat the insurance is only up to 5 lakhs.You can visit DICGC's websitewhich is tagged in the pinned commentsand section below.You can go and check.Can uncover all its details?You will learn a lot morebut this video was to explainthrough the example of Silicon Valley Bankthat how does a bank collapse?What are the risks that you may havewhen you are bankingand that's why it is often saiddon't just keep your money in the bank.If a lot of money is in just one bankthen spread it over multiple banksAnd always keep ensuringthat whatever money is in your bankyou are investing it regularlyin different things.So that you are managing the riskof any bank run that may happen on a bank.God willing should not happen,but God forbid if it happens,Then you should be smart about thisby being aware about this.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
