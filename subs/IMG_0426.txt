If you get a call from yourcredit card company that'Sir, your credit card limit of â¹2,00,000has increased to â¹5,00,000.'So should you say yes or no?Many people will say no, becausewhat's the point when there isno need for such a high credit limit?!But there are benefits to saying yes.A very important factor inyour credit rating ishow much do you use your limit?So if your limit is â¹2,00,000and you spend â¹50,000 in a month,then you are using 25%,but if your limit is â¹5,00,000and you are spending â¹50,000 a month,then you are using only 10%which means a better credit rating.So while keeping your monthly expensestable, go for a higher credit limit.
