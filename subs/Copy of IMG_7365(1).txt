Three steps to becomea morning person.Number one,sleep on time.To wake up earlyis not about waking up early,it is about sleeping on time.So if everydayat the right time,at the same timeyou don't sleep, you'll neverbe able to get up early.Number two,whenever you wake everyday,set an alarm ten minutesearlier than that.And wake up at that timefor at least three weeks.And then number three,When you do get upten minutes early,take ten minutes to get up.Not lying on your bed,by standing up,do something that graduallywakes you up in the morning.Every morning, I drinka glass of water,a glass of water.I drink a glass of water.Upto ten minutes.And that is the most joyous,the most peaceful experienceI have in the entire day.I would love for youto build one for yourself.
