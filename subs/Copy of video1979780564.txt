In today's Money Talks section,I have Prafull with me,who we very fondly know as MBA Chai Wala.Thank you so much, Prafull for joining mein this conversation.Itâs going to be very fun.How are you doing?I am doing great.I'm feeling very good that you invited me.I used to watch all your videos.In the same frame where you're now.But Iâve fit into that frame now.So, felling a little different,getting a special feeling.Iâm feel very good.It's wonderful Prafull, extremely awesome.Prafull, I know you'rein Ahmedabad right now,but I want to know your journeyand share it with everybody,who may not be aware of it,and even if they are,they know of Prafull today,as the MBA Chai Wala,but I want to take peopleto the Prafull of yesteryear.So, how was it growing up?Did you see a lot of moneyin your life as a child?Did not see?And with that how did your relationshipwith money begin?Correct so, a lot of people know,somewhere your and my audiencewould be mutual and common.But still this story, there is a districtin Madhya Pradesh as Dhar,Which is 50 km away from Indore,I was born and brought up there.I was there until the age of 20.My father is a farmer. I am a farmer's sonand weâre Brahmin as well.Thus, Bhagwat Katha discourse,so, my art of speaking,perhaps comes from my home and family.used to have Katha and varta at my home.So, comes from there. We didnât see money,we are middle class people. My father,I still remember, for our education,there happens to be 7-day Bhagwat Kathas.May have read about Shrimad Bhagavad Gita,So, in the nearby villagesof Dhar and Indore districts,papa used to do 20-25 renditionsof the katha nonstop, per week to 10 days.Used to go on tour, used to go for months.And there was farming along with it,we have 25 bighas of land.We used to grow wheat, soybean,maize, etc. thereI used to also go to the field that time.I still remember, I used to go on a bikeI've also brought a pile of grass behind.I have also seen the cow,I have seen everything,I've seen the rain and the rain flooding,I have seen irrigating the fields,I have seen everything.So, I grew up there,me and my younger brother, Vivek,who is very spiritual and religious,we both grew up together.We also fought a lot. We also moved ahead.but we understood one thing,that dad was struggling a lot,and only through educationyou can do something in life.And, yes, one educated person,in an entire village, family, and clan,can ignite a flame where they can thinkeven we can also do something in life.So, I was privilegedand I was fortunate enough to be the one.That Prafull is doing something,So, I was a curious plus studious student.I was good at reading and writing.But I was even very curious. At that time,I used to read books and newspapers.Used to watch news hours and debates.I was not a movie buff,who liked movies and cartoons, correct.And at that time, in my life,my friendship was with people my dad's agewith whom I used to sit.used sit and talk with people5 years senior to me.So, we were from a middle-class family.Dad worked hard.I was educated in a government school,I completed my studies from UtkrushtVidyalay School of Excellence in Dhar,also did my Bachelor of Commerce in Dhar.Many people think I'm a Gujarati.Many people think I'm from Ahmedabad.I am local, I am very intelligent,MBA pursuant from a big college.But the story is very different.Since to do business and make moneyI had to all marketing gimmicks.Had to hold conversations,More than tea had to serve knowledge,That story comes later, will tellyou further in the conversation.So, there wasnât much money,But yes, knew to put up a fight.Knew to survive with limitations,But also, had it inside, if it's not theredoesn't mean, will get satisfied.but yes, want to earn,As I used to mingle with peoplehigher in stature than me,had seen the luxuries of their house,Had seen cars at their homes.Had seen big chandeliers at their homes,What they call? There used to be CharlotteHad seen that.They used to have dinner at their home.Means, I am telling the truth, Ankur Sir.I am doing a very apt conversation,so, it used to be like,when will my first car arrive?When will my first iPhone arrive?Will I ever be able to take a flight?All those conversations used to happen,so, this way my childhood progressed,from there I felt, I had to do somethingThen started the world of CAT and GMAT,after I finished my BCom from thegovernment college of Dhar district.Because you don't get anygood job with BCom.You don't get much with BCom.It's just a degree.So, the last option for a personfrom commerce is to do an MBA.With MBA, I felt itâs the last year,and it will only work if I doan MBA from a big collegeLike you did from ISBC.Many people do it from IIMSo, I started preparing for CAT and GMAT.Since, I was a very studious student,I got involved with it, kept pursuing,prepared for 2 to 2-1/2 years.But for some reason didn't get admitted.Because I was not deserving that.To be honest, maybe I didnâtstudy better than them.Destiny had something else in store.Destiny wanted something else.Didn't get admitted, but at that timeI used to do my ROI calculationI was born in a Brahmin householdbut my mindset was of that of a trader.My intellect, my way of conversing,was that of a Marwari, a trader.Because I used to mingle with them.I changed my circle.I came out of my aura and met people.I always had that,I understood my circle,now letâs go to another circle,what do they eat, how do they drink,what do they talk, what do they listen,what is their conversation,why do they have expensive shoes,from where did the money to them?What did they do,that our ancestors couldn't do?So, that taught me a lotand life kept moving.That's fascinating, very, very --in your entire story, Prafull,most of all I felt that there wasa level of confidence on your own self.No matter where we are born,in whichever circumstances we grew up,we can draw ourselves out of itand create a new world for ourselves.Is this by birth that runs in your veinor did you learn it from someone?Or you can't explain, what do you think?Look, Ankur Sir, sometimesand nowadays what happens is,no question can have yes, no,or a one liner as an answer.Itâs a story in itself.That is a different life in itself.So, let me tell you,although there was pressure on methat I have to work, had seen poverty.You maybe knowing the storythere were two childrenwhose father was an alcoholic,one son goes on to be very successful,so, when asked, your fatherwas an alcoholic, how are you successful?He said, we saw our fatherturning alcoholic,so, we aspired for success,we wanted to be good,and the other son becomesan alcoholic againhe says my father was an alcoholic,so I also became an alcoholic.It's up to you, how do you take it.So, we saw poverty, we saw the struggle,we saw the struggle of our father.So, both brothers aspiredto do something in life.Though we were born poor,we will not die poor.All the resources, which you andthe people listening and watching on videosomewhere, even they desire, to go abroad.Even they wish to buy their first iPhone,place my first order at Starbucks.Everyone has a dream.Buy airports, make a good office, do this,There was a desire in us,but if you donât work in alignmentwith desire, resolve, and accomplishment,then itâs futile. Itâs just air.So, that pressure was there.My parents imparted good values.Introduced me to religion and deed.Taught to respect people.Never veered towards any bad habits.Never got into smoking or drinkingthat time. I am not saying itâs wrong.I am not calling anyone wrong.But sometimes got associatedwith good people.I had a good rapportwith my younger brother.Even today, he managesthe entire MBA Chai Wala.I am more like a marketing guy.So, we used to have aconversation between us,how can we succeed?so my brother, I still remember,Ankur Sir, he used to practice priesthood,he used to do kathaand give me pocket money.Because I was more into education.So, he used to do a katha for Rs. 500and give me 200 as pocket money,and used to say Prafull bro you work hard,go tour abroad and India,you learn and tell us,and we'll give you money, do not worry.Here you get a message thatmake your siblings, partners in life.Don't move away from them.They may be different,but make them a part.Give them importance.Papa showed a lot of faithand I used to repay them throughstudy and education.So, it's more like a package.Itâs more like the whole universebecomes destined if you want.The whole village, the city supports.Then a teacher Pinakin Barot, guru, came.Even in your life there may be a teacherwho may have taught you a lot.So, in a city like Dhar,which is a small district,is a tier 3/4 city,where there is nothing,There, Pinakin Sir, taught what is IIM,There, Pinakin Sir, told what is Domino's.What is a pizza order.He first created my LinkedIn account.It's a 10 to 9-year-old incident.Eight years ago, I used to accessmy LinkedIn account in my village.I still remember, for Rs. 48,there was a recharge of 1 GBavailable on Vodafone, at that time.At that time, I used to useLinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube.So, I had an idea that because of thisinternet you are not in a village.The accessibility someone gets in Delhibecause of the internet,is also available in Labrawada,in my village in Dhar,So, there are many thingsthat made me Prafull and MBA Chai Wala.Very good, very, very, very inspiring.At which point, you then decided,for this to progressI have to get out of my world,there, of course, isnât much goingto happen with BCom that you had done,so, was there a trigger, Prafull,was there a time or was there a personwho provoked you and toldthat now is the time has come.You are ready for the big game.Now, go and start leavingyour mark on the world.So, again Ankur Sir, as I said,I always had friendshipwith people 4-5 years senior to me.in terms of experience, wealth, and life,who seen more ups and downs.So, I ask them a lot of questions,I am curious guy,So, Ankur Sir, if you've take admissionin IIM, then how much will you earn?How much will that cost?What would be the return on investment,so, they gave a road mapthat Prafull it happens this way.Then, asked 5, 10, 25 people,rummaged the internet,I used to write answers on Quora then,You may be knowingQuora 2-3-4 years ago was trending a lotSo even today,I have millions of views there.I used to write myself and learn,because I was learning English,So, when I got answers there,I understood donât just rely on education.Donât just rely on a college or degree.And life doesnât get sorted at 20, 22, 25.At 25-30, nor are you the main characterof someoneâs life or your own life,You are not the main characterof someone else's life.Nor of any degree or any college,So started understanding earlyand kept karma with me,kept karma behind, see what happens,Ankur Sir, even if I watch your videos,but if there is no push of karma behind,then even Ankur Sir's words are nonsense.Ankur sir's words are also meaningless,they are not meaningful,So, papa taught karma.Younger brother taught to work.Learn 10 things, before that,work on eight things,then learn the 11th thing.So, that was very inspiringand there was pressure from insideof doing something in lifebecause I always say thatChandra Shekhar Azad ji,Sadguru ji, Rajguru ji,Mahatma Gandhi ji, what did they have?They did not have crores or billions.No one used to take their selfie.they didnât have a million followers.They didn't have a blue tick,yet they sacrificedtheir own life to liberate us,then why not turn our lives aroundby becoming selfish for our own self?So that used to run in back of the mind.I it used to always run,I used to see people around me.who used to be reliant on the government,some were dependent on a degreeto somehow get a job, get a fixor get connected to a minister.So, in that field, I felt no, your life,you will have to make your own story,because the country is very big,opportunities are also many,but everyoneâs demand cannot be met.You'll have to script your own story.Then stayed put, stood up, and went ahead.Thatâs brilliant man.Thatâs brilliant, wonderful.Did you know from the beginningthat this path that you are on,will take you to successor were you engaged in processes?How do I think is, process is everything,I donât know, after the video,this will be viralor receive hate comments, or get roasted.But if even 1 lakh people watch this,maybe a couple of them will also love me.Maybe one of them buys my franchisepossibly a couple of followers get addedMaybe they give me business in the future,Are you getting me?It's all about trial and error.If you throw 100 stones at a mango tree,then two or four will get you a mango.But that doesn't meanthe 96 you threw didn't fetch you a mango,it's part of the process.Second is, you get success in life.At least give yourself time,at least stay consistent.At least give 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years.Don't become a dog that can eat a biscuit,crap, grass, chocolate, and everything.Become a lion, hunt once in 5 years,but hunt a deer.It takes some time,Sir, our dreams are big.Our dreams are maybe thisand these are our deeds.So the one in between is sorrow.Either raise your deedor curtail your dreams and desires.So, I've always been sorted in life.Even today I am sorted.There was a clarity of vision,even if I get or not get money,get or not get respect, have to work,because I have heard stories,have heard yours as well sir.At the age of 65, KFC started,Harland Sanders had startedhis stall at 65 in Kentucky.Many people taste success late in life.So there was never a hurryto have it today or tomorrow itself.Want to be a millionairebut not in a hurry, will get there.Will become at 35 or 40.There is no hurry.I love this.I think this, at your age,this thing is so necessary,to learn, handle,to know that life is longand good things take time.If you genuinely want to dosomething good with your life,and if you want to stay happy,it takes time. What's the hurry?If you are enjoyingthe process and journey,you wouldn't be hastyin reaching the destinationbecause the path itself is so beautiful.Ankur Sir, I want to narrate a story.I am stopping you.There is a country named Zambia in Africa.I had read a story in a book.IMF, World Trade send there,so that they have homes, toilets,so they send bricks, sand, mortar.So there was an author there,an Australian author, who had penneda book called "Follow your Heart."So there was a pile of bricks there.There were a few kids.They pick up a few bricks and keep it somewhere else.Pick them up from the pileand keep it somewhere.The author was observing for a long time,that where are the kids taking the bricks.So the author asks the kidswhat are you doing with the bricks?Where are you taking them?So the kids reply they wantto construct a temple.He said, good you want to build a temple.If you take the bricks one by one,when will you build the temple,when will you bring the material.The kids tell the author what's the hurry,it will get built one day, at leastwe brought our today's brick.So, the author was shocked and I wasimpressed with that story 6-7 years back.That at least, have brought today's brick,what's the hurry,will get constructed someday.That's so beautiful.Absolutely, I thinkthis will be the title of the video."I have brought and kept today's brick,"like that, that is so, so true.I may be wrong on this,but I'd directly like to know from you,usually in the media,it is being said, MBA Chai Wala,in a way was angry thathe couldn't get into MBA.In a way wanted to show the society,despite that he can do something.So because of that thenthis entire name and persona got made.And, today,you motivate people in a big way,running your story, running your business,but in your mind Prafull,was there anger or drive,what were the emotions?What happens is, when you work,where you really want to do somethingin life, and want to do it in a good way,want to do a class 1 business,don't want to do a class 2 business.When you also want to accept the society,you have dreams when you're young.You would want to tour Goa,would want to see a girl or a guy.Are you understanding? So this mindis fickle. This is an age of restlessness.So, I did whatever I likedat that point in life.When I felt I wanted to leave MBA and CAT,want to drop out,want to work at McD, I did.And along with doing, showed it, because,we are middle-class people.We don't have a big privileged family,don't have money or fame.So, we'll either sell our storyor impart knowledge.And it was the age of internet,doesn't matter, at a recharge of 200the whole world opens up to you.You invert your phonelike this and share your story.So those who can relatewith me, because even today,India's youth is running behind degree.He has problems, he has pressure,so they liked my story there.Buddy, let's do something like him.So they liked it. They followed,I know even today, my wordsare selling more than my tea.My tea was selling less,but my followers were increasing.So, I said, if tea is not getting sold,let's increase the followers.At that time, felt brand deals happen,can even make money out of YouTube.So I said fine, will make tea,alongside will make YouTubeand Instagram as well.So now, don't know, the tea decreasedand the YouTube and Instagram increased.The second thing, media alwayswants to sell a story,by selling crores, leaving MBA.They need PR, at that timeI wasn't mature enough,and had never appeared in the newspaper,so whatever they said, agreed to it,get it printed.Third thing, I was verygenuine in the process.I was very genuine and I neverwanted to sell my story.I'm still telling you, and this is,very openly I'm telling you,because no one wants to sell his story.Because, see,story is temporary, work is permanent.Even today you ask me to run a tea stall,I'll be able to do it, becausefor 2 to 2-Â¼ years I sold tea on the road.And, I would proudly say, I have sold it.When Ankur Sir can say,your time management is done this way,you can shape your life like this,I have actually run a tea stall,why shouldn't I tell the world,that I haven't run.And another thing,I said that you don't have resourceswhen you come from a small family,so through the internet,you have a very wonderful opportunityto connect with unknown people,where you tell stories about people,and nowadays it's different,you sell the product later,first you sell your story,then people buy your product.Now the Ganges have startedflowing reverse in the market.I sensed this 7-8 yearsago through the internet,Ankur Warikoo, who is sitting in Gurgaon,or in Goa or in Mumbai,will lend his ears to the storyfrom Dhar, Labrawda.He may have not seen me physically,he may have not tasted my product.And desperate timescall for desperate measures.If business isn't doing well and small.Want to make money in life,want to become successful, be it internet,knowledge, motivation,do anything, but want that number,should have business of 10,000 every day,should have a business of 8,000 every day,Because I had expenses.Because once you're habituatedto earning money,it can't be given up.That's so true. That is true man,that's true. So, today, Prafull,how would you describe yourself?Today we have a tea business,have 150 outlets countrywide,and a couple of more businesses,I've already invested in many businesses.I have become an angel investor.Earn from talk shows.Through YouTube, Instagram,brand collaboration, reels.I earn money.So, money is side by.Never thought, Sir,I was in the race for MBA,Would've got a job worth 1.25 to 1.5 lakhsalary. Would've been happy with that.Today we're payingsalaries to 100 families.hadn't even thought that by keepingthe name MBA would become famous.If I keep you, Ankur, you say name it,Elon Musk Chai Wala,so is it necessary your shop will work.Ankur Warikoo ji, keep any other name,in reality to write a nameand to establish a name as a brandis a totally difficult task.It's a very different worldSecond, I'll tell myself,I'm such a torchbearer in Indiawho is telling people whateveryou're doing, wherever you are,in whatever situation or condition,whether you're rich, poor, security guard,tea vendor, Ankur Warikoo, YouTuber,Instagram influencer,your papa runs a pani puri stallor a boutique, whatever it may be.Make yourself feel important.Don't consider yourself smallin front of anyone.Don't assume your work to be small.Don't feel that he is someone prominent.The day this distancediminishes in our country,the weight of dignity of labor over thehead which has grown like a big rock,I am trying to remove thatand also my motivation and reasonfor making the video was,people stay very scared and subdued.They are fearful.They are scared to placetheir first order at Starbucks.If they book a flight for them,they fear about the boarding pass.So, I thought, why not, becauseI have seen that pain.Because I grew up there.So I share, even today, in BiharUttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh,Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,crores of youngsters get inspired by me,why? Because they know, yes Prafull Bhai,what you're saying is the truth.So, I wouldn't say to myselfI've achieved big,I wouldn't say my company is very big,I know the turnover is just minimal.But yes, I want thatlike Prafull Billore MBA Chai Wala,more 25-50 thousand people should come.Everyone make their reputation.125 crore people have their identity proofAnkur Sir, but lack identity.There was no need for you either,You had a good job, start-up,can work anywhere. By availing morefunding could have created a unicorn.But why are you running a YouTube video,because there is a thought inside you alsothat you'd do good for people in some way.And it's not like selling your abodeand making a pilgrimage.We are also earning, we're earning Rs. 100and giving knowledge of Rs. 10,Or earning Rs. 100 and giving knowledgeworth a thousand, then within us,Every person has a feeling of patriotism,everyone has a feeling towards societyto give back to the society.That may have crept into me early.For some it comes in late.So, I would tell myselfthat I want every person to dosomething in this country,irrespective of small or big, earn their money first.Put efforts, don't rely on the government.Make your own story. Make by any name,sell anything, but do something.Beautiful, very, very beautiful.This emotion in itself is enoughto motivate someone.Prafull tell me, whenyou started making money in the beginning,you were already making moneythrough the tea stall,but then started making through contentas well, multiple income streams came in.So was it the first instancewhere you got moneyand maybe you got so much money,you were like we canearn money through this also.People are also getting helped.We are going ahead as well.What did you begin to do with that money?What did you do with that money?Spent on yourself, invested in business,how did you spend?Ankur, I'll share an interesting thing,lot of your audience will listen.There is a saying in our Malwa,from where I come, is Malwa,Malwa area, Madhya Pradesh."Beese budhi, teese dhan,"up to the age of 20, means until age 29work on intellect, work on learning,after 30 concentrate on wealth.So this thing was within,even dad used to teach.So there was excitement around money,but funneled that on learning.When money came,I didn't buy jeans, didn't buy a phone.Traveled, toured some good place,went to a corporate and learnt,again invested back into business.Gave it to employees.Employed four new guys.When money from business goes intobusiness, business grows, everybody knows.But yes I understood one thing,the universe is limitless,the world is big, at least try once,you'll get money beyond your imagination.You'll get love beyond your imagination.And I understood one more thing,even today nor me or you feel,I don't love money.And I've seen prominent figures toowho have been really successful,who may even be billionaires,In reality they may not love money,they may be in love with work.They may be enjoying working,and money is totally a byproduct.I still remember,along with the tea stallI've put up hundreds and thousandsof tea stalls at marriages.Udaipur, Jaipur, Delhi, Lonavla,Jio Garden; Jim Corbett,  Uttarakhand,where destination weddings take place.In Kutch.There, on beaches, big party plots,where 4-5 Cr. weddings take place,used to go there to make tea.I still remember, when I used to charge50 thousand for making tea at weddings.A lakh for a 2-day wedding for making tea.So the point was, I was thinking,by doing an MBA will get a Rs. 1 lakh job,Iâm getting 1 lakh by even making tea,so sometimes what happens,the thing that seems very big to us,the money that seems to be very big,with time becomes very small.For the audience listening today,20, 25, 40 thousand, lakh, 2 lakh,may seem big, but with the passage of timewhen you actually work,the amount will become very small.So, never take the burden,even I didn't take that.That's beautiful. Absolutely awesome.How do you invest your money now?How do you use it? How do you spend it?So, we have a diverseportfolio to be honest.Real estate is one of the top,then gold, just because of security,and someday if you feel, can be convertedto cash reserve by taking gold loan,because nowadays you don't know,one disease, one accident,one such incident happens at your house,then when will you liquidateyour equity stock?if you are given gold, you get your money.Third, I invest in company. I am an angelinvestor. I invest in so many companies,so far, the portfoliowill come to almost 30-35.That is there. Fourth, I feel thatI have developed a lot of human asset.Today, I know, even thoughI don't need 10 people I still hire them.Today you give someone a lakh in salary,he brings in a monthly business of10-15 lakhs, in way of talk shows, events.We are into FMCG nowadays,so have diversified the portfolio.We invest in land, we're sons of a farmer.So, we also spenda little money to buy land.Great, absolutely great.Very beautiful and becauseyou're doing so many things Prafull,how do you organize your work?Like, how does your day usually pan out?Ankur sir, I am a very organized guyand I'm a very selective guy.I filter things.And I only prioritize work.My younger brother, Vivek Billore,who is now handling the entirebusiness of MBA Chai Wala,and his arrival has been of immense help.Making a brother a partner, co-founder,instills trust, and no onehas to look into.He helps a lot.But, I work very hard.I work for 13-14 hours.I also make videos, I also get connectedand also conduct a meeting.What happens is, in life,the day you understand the valueof every minute, every second, 10 seconds,where you are investing.Now we are doing the 30-minute podcast,why did I consent?This has now become a digital asset,this will stay for lifetime,this will reach lakhs of people.So investing this way.Ankur Sir, if someone doesn't invite me,I go to them, invite me,so how it is, you're the first marketer,so again coming to the question,I am very focused,When someday, I feel I'm getting a bitdistracted, I make 5-10 calls to people,show me some work, let's do something.I sleep a little late,I'm unable to rise early,I get up at 8-9 o'clock.So, I work according to that.But now the team has expanded,so don't need to work much,need to get it done.There is a task list, tell themthese 10 tasks are to be done.Make them 20 instead of 10,will at least do 17 or 15 of them.There's efficiency, delegation of work,team managementand the clarity of thought has enhancedwith the focus being on what not to doinstead of what to do.his is time waste, don't do this,close this, do this.Thatâs so powerful, man.Thatâs so powerful, what you mentioned,is very important,that there has to be clarityabout what not to do.Because whatever that sucks time,makes time fly and you don't even realize.That's beautiful. I always say that,the thing that financially, emotionally,mentally, physicallydoesn't help you grow,distance yourself from that or else life is a waste.So true, absolutely,you said it absolutely right.Anything in your day,that you are doing even nowand you feel you shouldn't do.Now see, before this I gave the statementthat I know what I want to do.I gave the statement thatI know what I don't want to do.I am very much sorted and I am proud it.Nowadays my video team tells me,a lot of roasting andtrolling is taking place,So I said, now see, how it is,keeping doing you job,10-20 out of 100 people will keepgoing up and down and that's their job.Still they told to stop the videofor a few days, let's not post videos.I said no, because of which you aregetting so much of love if you leave that,there isn't a bigger useless personor a bigger anti-national than you.At least keep faith in your deeds.Absolutely, so true, so true.Wonderful Prafull,Before going, three rapid firequestions for you,so that we connectmore with your thoughts.No. 1.What do you think is the biggestand expensive purchase in your life?What would it be?We have recently purchasedour TATA Harrier car.Itâs a 26-lakh car.I had never imagined thatwe would purchase this much.Although, I have made an investmentof a similar budget even in companies.But that is an investment.My brother likes cars a lot.My brother likes super bikes.And, my father,I still remember, Ankur Sir,on one single bike, all threeof us, father and sons,used to go from village to city,city to village, and get things fixed.So everyone's car coming there,so that I feel is the bestand most costly purchase,which was of 26 lakhs.Wow, that is amazing.And what do you feel will happen in life?Will happen in life, means?Any desire, any wish?Within me wishes have diminished a bit.There isn't anything left to get, eat,or earn money, because --How old are you?I'm 25.What absolute elderly talk?I am visiting 12 jyotirlinga and 4 dhams,in which around 3-4 jyotirlingas are leftand 1 dham is left.After that I am going to Europe,Will do my world tour, which was my dream.In the next 1 to 1-Â½ years to 2 years,my entire bucket list will get completed.So, I don't have any issues,as such there is noambition or wish either.Very good, means,may everyone be blessedwith such satisfaction in life.Ok, question No. 2.Prafull, for you, is speedmore important or perfection?According to me consistency,means speed and perfection,Sometimes see, you've also done business.I've also done business,sometimes speed will come down,sometimes perfection will come down,sometimes will have perfection,speed will come down.Can't have all the arrows on a bow.All the swords can't fit into a sheath.And what I feel is, you maybe 1% better,you are doing some work.Consistency is more importantthan intensity, that's what I feel.And, not even anyone's fathercan bring in perfection,in anything, even if it's God himself.Because it's not in your hands.How is the society? How is the place?How are the people working with you?What's your business?How much money you have invested?At what time you invested?after multiple parameters,cross and check, trial and error,you get perfection.And you get speedwhen your track is created.Let me tell you, on 25th June 2017,I started my tea stall for the first time.I personally ran thetea stall for 2 years,and after that COVID came for 2 years.The growth that MBA ChaiWala saw in the last 8 monthswas not seen in the last 5 years.But those 5 years created a track,in those 5 years, built up social media.Today there is a lot of speed. Today,we can open 100 tea outlets rapidly.So, in my estimation, prepare yourself,do your war zone period,then you will achieve speedas well as perfection.Very beautiful, ok, No. 3, last question,what do you feel, is the biggestmisunderstanding about you in the world.One such thing thatyou may have got tired explaining people,people have not understood it,or people don't want to understand.One thing that you would love to clarify.There are two-three things, many youths,I donât know how much they struggle.Because todayâs youth, if you're a youth,you are of a lesser age, youâre becomingan entrepreneur for the first timeyou have to also work hardabove your neck and below it as well.So what is above the neck?Speaking, eyes, ears, nose,work hard on that. What is down?Sweating it out with hands and legs.So, on my tea stall, I appliedmy mind as well as my limbsAt youth, if he mixes it, will hework hard with his limbs or his head.The day it mixes, yoursuccess is guaranteed.So, people canât acceptthat I've really sold tea for real.People canât accept that he has onlyspread knowledge on social media.Because they have not seen struggle,because they are sitting in AC,because they are ashamedto even sip tea on the roadside, so,they canât accept he may have sold tea.He has given moreknowledge, he has made a story,he has launched a fake narrative.So, I feel like, in reality,I have come from a backgroundwhere struggling comes easily.We come from a background where we havehave struggled and we wanted to.Secondly, people think thathe only imparts knowledge.Even today, I don't feel that my team,my co-founder, my brother,and 100 people working behind,are really working hard day and night.I am giving an interview in front of you,even now Iâm sitting in companyâs officewhere 35-40 people are working.So, sometimes what happens,what you see is not like how it seemsand what you're understanding,what you are assuming is wrong.That's so true, it's also true.The story of the iceberg that,what is visible to us andwhat is under the sea,only very few people are able to see.And that is usually  3, 4, 5,10 times more, but that isâ¦Are unable to accept,for them itâs, what has he done as such?has only sold tea, what has he donethat has got him so much name and fame.So, I always say, look atany prominent personality,what is that he has done differently,he is not making any super power.Not every person is a scientist,not everyone is an Elon Musk.Sell small things properly,properly market it, make a brand,even you can become successful,and we need to accept it,and we need to respect successful people,I am telling you,because if you can't respect aprominent and successful personality,even you donât deserve to be that man.Absolutely, so true, so true.On that note, I love that closure,thank you so much Prafull,I hope that you keep living your lifewith the same energy and same clarity.Keep inspiring people.Thank you so much for sparingtime today out of your schedule.And all the best for everythingthat you have to doand will be doing Prafull.Thank you, Ankur Sirand you are doing just an amazing job.What you are doing is a big saintly deed.And, Iâll  tell you, in a far off village,city, sitting on a sofa someone must beshowering you with somany blessings and gratitudebecause people from a big citymay not be able to understandmaybe privileged kids may not understand,what kind of sadness afarmerâs son from a village sees.Youâre answering all hisquestions through your video,you're doing a great job,and my people who are listening to me,like and subscribe to Ankur Sirâs channelexpand his familyand give him more blessings,keep moving ahead.Thank you, same wishesfor you as well, Prafull,thank you so much. All the best.Thank you Ankur Sir.All the best. Thank you. Thank you.
