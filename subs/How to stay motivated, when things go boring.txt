In all of our livesa routine is our very favorite word.But there is a routinein which we are happy.Everything is happening for us,but often peoplefind themselves in another routine.A routine where they wake up.Work like a robot, the day ends,eat something,sit in front of the TV or phone,go to sleep, the day starts again,and again the same routine.Same daily routine again.There is no excitement in life.There is no spontaneity.You are neither excited towards anything,nor anticipating anything,nor are you happy for anything.You only wait for one thing,that the weekend comes from somewhere,holidays come around.This routine of life,may break for us somewhere,and can do something new.If you feel this, you are not alone.Every person at some point or the other,at some point in his life,finds himself here.Where life has become so mechanical,it has become so robotic,that one does not know what to do?So here are 10 ways to stay motivatedwhen you begin to seethat things are getting boring.Number one:1st January has come just recentlyand imagine on 1st January,you make the same resolution,which the whole world takes together.This year I have to lose weight.And you know what?I am very happy today.I am going to give you alla free gym membership.But this is a very strange new gym.There are some special things in this gym.Number one,there are no mirrors in this gym.So you can't see yourself.There is no weighing scale in this gymso you cannot weigh yourself.There is no measuring tape in this gym,so you can't even measureyour waist or anything.And you know what is the best thing?When you go to this gym,there is not a single other person.Neither human, nor humankind.Only you.Even if I give you free membershipin such a gym,I can say it with a written suretythat you will leave this gymwithin a week.And you know what's more surprising?In that one weekeven if your weight is really decreasing,you will not go to this gym,because you will not get somethingwhich is the most of fundamental thing,which is necessary for every human being.A sense of progressthat you are moving forward.You do not get any progress feedbackin this gym.Neither can you see yourself.Can't weigh, can't measure,and no one will come and tell you,hey Ankur, you are looking a little fit.When you lack that sense of progress.Things slow down.They completely get crushed.So the very first wayto motivate yourself in your lifewhen you are finding things to get boringis start measuring your progress,not the end result, but of each step.When I watch my videos todayand videos from 3 years ago,I see progress.I'm still measuringthe same three videos a week.I'm still doing the same Shorts,the same Reels.But every week, every month,every quarter,I see progress not in numbers,but in my quality, my output.Progress is visiblein my entire team's workand that motivates mebecause I know that measuring progressis the surest way to make me feellike I have achieved it?A person doesn't feel happyby achieving the target or goal.A person is happy when he knowsthat he is movingtowards the goal and target.Point number one.Point Number Two:And this is very important,especially if you're in your 20s.In our 20s, we feelthat everything should happen quickly,happen overnight,overnight, we reach here,we achieve that.Take this here, take that,buy that, get that.But you need to know matethat life is a Marathon, not a sprint.In a 100-meter race, how early you startand how quickly you coverthe first 10-20 metersdetermines whether or notyou'll win the race.But life is not at all a 100-meter race.Life is a 40-45 km Marathon,where it doesn't matterhow ahead you are in the first 100 metres,in the first kilometer.The difference is whether you can runat the same speed for 40 km or not.So that you not only finish that Marathonbut also beat the people.Because people out of excitement,will show their full energy at the start,but by the end will run out of steam.A way to motivate yourselfis to keep telling yourself,I don't want to win the race tomorrow,I want to stay in this race till the end.I don't want to win this race tomorrow.I just want to ensure that every day,I come and measure my progress,I do something that I am proud of.Slowly and gradually,you will get to that point,where you will be far aheadof everyone else.Here's a fun fact, last week, we realizedthat we have reached 2 million followerson LinkedIn.Then we got to knowfrom the LinkedIn team.There are only three peoplein this whole world.Only three people.Who have more than 2 million followerson LinkedIn, on YouTube, and on Instagram.Gary Vaynerchuk,Bill Gates,and Narendra Modi.And the fourth personin this whole wide worldwho has 2 million followerson these three platforms,is Ankur Warikoo.I didn't have this as my goal.This was not even in my mind.In fact, I had forgotten,the whole team had also forgottenthat we have crossed2 million on LinkedIn.When I got to see, and then asked,then I came to know,do you realize the power of a Marathon.Motivation is comingonly by showing up every day.Not because we are going on winning,going on achieving wins.But we are able to get to a point,where this Marathonand every day showing up,becomes part of our motivation.Number 3:Appreciate the small things.Whenever it feelslife is getting burdensome,whenever it seemsthat nothing is moving in life,step back and appreciatethe small things that you have.There are two ways.Keep a gratitude journal.Every day at the end of the day,write in your journalwhat things you are grateful for.If nothing has happened on that day,then write that I am aliveand I am able to write this.I am thankful for this very thing.You will always find thingsto be grateful for.Another way that I find very beautiful,Keep a gratitude jar.So it can be a fish bowl,or a glass jar, or even a bottle,in which you will put a chit every day.That chit would be,what are you grateful for today.And just put it in.Whenever at some point,the days seem difficult,life seems overwhelming,shaking that jar take out a chit.Read it and it will instantly remind you,that your life is so precious, so special,and you have a lot to look forward to.Number Four:Change your surroundings.This is such a brilliantpsychological hack.Where you study, where you work,there is a set method, a set system.Change it.Move your bed from here, bring it here.Move your table from here, bring it here.Bring the laptop from hereand start working here.Where your pen stand is,move it and bring it here.Give a new look to all your things.What will happen because of that?Your mind will thinkthat there is a new versionand it will actually act just as excitedas it does when it gets a new thing,when it gets a new toy.And this is such a simple hackto get you to be excited again.Because then you are entering a new world.Entering with a fresh perspectiveand that will help you feel motivatedwhen things go boring.Number Five:Pick up a hobby, a new interestand it can be anything.In your 20s where we get a crushon every single person,we get infatuated,then it's really exciting.You go to the gymand you find someone cuteor you find someone really hotand you are like hey,it is fun going to the gymand you are not really going to work outbut you are going to spend time with them.Hopefully make friends with them.And that's a new hobby.That's a new passion.That's a new interest.You pick up a new sport,take a new music lessonor some other lessonor you start reading books.You join a community.You basically do somethingso that there is a breakin your everyday life.And it is not as monotonous as it isand you will not give the excuse of time.You will not say that, no,it takes a long time,keep working whole day or keep studying.I don't have time for all these things,so that time has to be taken out.Because trust mewhen by doing all these different thingsyou get a new energy, a new excitement,you will bring that energyand that excitementinto your work as well.And because of thatyou will be more productive.Will be more focused.Because you will knowthat once you're done,you can always go back to the thingthat you are most excited about.Number Six:This is crazy but it's true.Get some sunshine.As soon as you wake up in the morning,one is wake up at a timewhere the sun is outand moment you wake upin the first 1-2 hours,give your body sunlight.Direct Sunlight.It is this proven to increaseour motivationand make us feel positive.Because Vitamin D deficiencyis very rampant in this generation.Because we don't get sun.We do not see the sun.Or we don't want to see.So we don't come out.In our office, in our room,just stay in the dark.And that is not going to be healthyfor your body.Get some sunshine.First one or two hoursas soon as you wake up,hopefully during sunlight hours.Get that sunlightand get your body activated.Next. Remove sugar from your life.Sugar is known to make you go numb.It is known to make you go lazy.It is known to make you cravea lot more for sugar,make you crave a lot more for food,make you hungrier and increaseyour glucose and insulin levels.You do not want this damageto happen with your body.So, even if want to eat sugarthen please eat very minimally.Not that keep eating.Not that keep taking.One hack that I usewhenever I feel the craving for sugaris I drink water.And drinking waterstops the sugar craving a lot.And then I also chew gum.So I eat some chewing gum.One a day, maximum two,but I keep chewing it.Because I knowmy mouth is busyso because of thatI can't even eat anythingand whatever the sugar craving is,that comes down due to the sugar-free.And that is my hackwhich has worked brilliantly for me.I'm sure it will work for you as well.Next, follow the right content.Motivation is a very interesting thingwhenever things go boringand we listen to anything motivating.Imagine by watching this videoyou are getting some motivation.Or you watch some other videoof Sandeep Maheshwari,or Vivek Bindra, or someone else,then feel motivated.Watch some movie,feel motivated by that.But you have to ask this question,if on that day,you had not seen that video,or that video would not have come,would not have been even released,or that movie was never made,or you would not have seen it,how else would youhave motivated yourself?We think that motivation is such a thingthat we take it for a dayand then it continues for a week, no.Motivation something that is like food.We need to consume it every day.It is not that if you binged today,you can go without eating for a month.No, it is not going to happen.The same way,motivation is required every single day.Do something that inspires youthat motivates you every single day.Don't leave motivation to chance.Make it a choice.Make it a discipline.So follow the right content.Any content that makes you feel badabout your lifeor that content which makes you feel,that you are not able to do anything.Unfollow that. Delete it.And only and only follow those peoplewho make you believe,that you can do it.Who makes you believethat you have the ability.Who makes you believeby applying effort and timeeverything can be achieved.That is the content you gonna follow.And finally, and this is a reality.If in spite of doing all these thingsyou still find life overwhelming,feels like there is still a rockkept on the chestand are not able to move.It's possible that you are goingthrough a lot morethan what you think you are.So seek help. Seek therapy.Go and reach out to a therapist.Seek professional help.Because to process this thing,we will probablyneed that professional helpwhich our friends, parents,brothers and sisters cannot provide.Because they don't knowhow to deal with it.It could be somethingthat requires medical intervention.It could be somethingthat doesn't require medical interventionbut certainly requiresprofessional intervention.Whatever it is.Don't think that therapyis only for peoplewho are mentally sick.No, that's not true.Therapy is a way for you to processyour feelings and your emotions.When things start getting overwhelmingand you are unable to solve themat your own end,by talking to someonewho can understand it scientifically,who can help you in processingis the right decision to make.Through these 10 methods,you can make anythingthat is boring for youcan be made exciting through motivation.Can make exciting through inspiration.And remember, in spite of doing all this,it will take time.Because the most beautiful things in life,love, contentment, fulfillmentcomes only with time.You cannot short circuit that.So as long as you are patientand as long as you makethe journey exciting, this journeyis going to be beautiful for youand that's my hope.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
