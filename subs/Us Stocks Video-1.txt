Check 1 2 check 1 2If you want to directly invest inUS stock market while being in India,so there are 5 main problems around that,which are now fixed,How? Weâll get to know in this video.Friends, I made a video onâHow to invest in US stock marketsâ.In my portfolio, about 60% of my investmentsgo towards Indian stock market,so whether it is smallcase or direct stocks,but near about 40% goes in to US stock markets.Now why US? Because all the start-upsthere work on a global platform,whether it is Facebook or Amazonor Apple or Google, they access a huge market,they are sitting on a lot of cashflows,so it tends to be a great market to tap in to.The second very important thing is,I wouldnât call it important but a veryconvenient thing which is not possible in India,that you can buy fractional shares,which means you do not have to buy one share.For example, one share of Google is for $2200,which is a very expensive share,so if you want to buy one shareand pay $2200 or about â¹1,80,000or â¹1,70,000, you donât have that kind of money,maybe you have only â¹15,000,and that means you can actually buya Google stock worth â¹15000 or â¹5000or â¹1000 or â¹500, because you can buyfractional shares which meanless than one unit shares.For all these reasons the US isa great place to buy stocks fromif you want to take a long-term beton really successful large global tech companies,for that matter, any company.Now to do all this, there were 5 bigdisadvantages or problems whichI used to encounter in the last one year,until I discovered Vested which is mydefault US investing app nowand I wanted to talk to you about that.The first problem which really hurts meand especially someone like you whoâsa new investor, doesnât have a lot of money,is that sending money to US isa very expensive affair.Now to invest in US market, you willsend money to US, you cannot buy stocksin US market directly from India.So the way that it works which I showedin my video earlier as well, is that youtransfer money to a brokerage accountwhich is Drivewealth from your Indian Bank account.And then you buy stocks on the behalf of Drivewealth.So your stocks are actually not on the appSo the app that you are using is notbuying your stocks, whether it is Vestedor something else, it is Drivewealth who isbuying US stocks, so your stocks are therewith Drivewealth, and it is securedand insured because Drivewealth isa reputed and accredited investoror investment firm.But to send money from Indiato the US is expensive. Why?Number 1, banks charge anywherebetween â¹1000-2500, irrespectiveof the amount. So if you want totransfer â¹5000, so you will have to payfees of â¹1000 and your returnautomatically reduces, which meansyou should only be transferring whenyou have at least â¹1 lakh, which is avery large sum, that is number one.Number 2, very often the exchange rateis not so good because when your rupeeis converted into a US dollar thereis a loss somewhere or the other.Number 3 and the biggest problem iswhenever you transfer money,it is invisible for 2-3 days. You don't haveany idea at all where is your money,when will it be transferred, when willbe credited, so it is a little uncertainand very anxiety-driven that you havesent the money and you don't knowwhether it has reached or not.To solve this Vested has completely...To solve this Vested came up witha completely new process called Vested Direct.It is a brilliant very simple process wherethey create an account on your behalfand your money instantly...No sorry cut cut cutTo solve this Vested launched somethingcalled Vested Direct and it is a brilliant processbecause you don't have to pay any fees for it,which is great.You get the best exchange rates,which is awesome.And you get 100% tracking aboutwhere is your money and inhow many days will it be credited?You know the whole process I spoketo Viram who is the founder of...One minute pleaseI'll keep rolling but I just have to get somethingAlright I am back sorryAditya somebody came to your houseTo talk about this, I spoke to Viramwho is the founder of Vestedand he explained that how has thisprocess become so easy.You can also of course see on the screen,how without paying any fees you canget the money transferred,you get direct visibility aboutwhere is your moneyand in how many days will it be credited?It is such a simple way of transferringyour money to the US account ofDrivewealth so that you can trade from there.At this point Aditya you will haveto bring a little snippet of my conversationwith Viram who is the founder,that zoom conversation. Don't spend much time,1 minute or a maximum of 1.5 minutes.So just try to summarise what he has said,of course after watching the screen recordingso that you know that you are tallying that.I leave it to your judgment but that'ssomething that you'll have to do.OkSecond big problem is that when youare buying a US stock by using an Indian app,then you do not get that in-depth analysiswhich you expect when you are buying any stock.For instance, if you buy an Indian stockfrom Zerodha, which is the platformthat I use, then I get to see a lot,you have deep analysis,you have fundamental analysis,you have technical analysis.You can see all the charts,the candlestick figures.So if you are an active traderor you are even a long-term investor,then all the details are necessary.Right now what we do is,use an app for trading,and another app for all thefundamental analysis and technical analysis,which is not a seamless process.Vested now has all of this informationinbuilt into the app and thedesktop version as well which isa game-changer because you don'thave to go anywhere. All the required details,every bit of information that you needis right in front of you.Viram discussed all this with meand told me how does it really helpand what is it that Vested has done differently.At this point also you will bring Viram in,and screen recording can play side by side.So it doesn't need to show my face.Whatever Viram would be saying,on this part, plus the screen recordingon both sides, so let me just veryquickly see what it was.Hold on.So you have problem 2 trends 1,which is just showing the trends piece,and then problem 2..No sorryYou start with problem 2 trends 2,which shows all the fundamental analysisand candlestick figures. I will just saysomething for trends 1 because I missed that.A very interesting feature that Vestedhas launched is, it shows you a veryquick summary of the trending stocks.So if you want to buy trending stockswithout thinking too much, trendingbased on the last one day, last one week,and so on, so it has done all the calculationsfor you. So you can see those stocksand you can figure out if you want tobuy Amazon because it is trending,or Google because that is trending.Something which is very simplisticfor an early investor and a new investorsuch as yourself.So what I said right now,at this point show the trend 1 recordingand you will show Viram's conversationwith trend 2 side by side when he is talkingabout the entire analysis.The third big problem was wheneveryou buy stocks from India,then you should know which stocksshould you buy, right?You do not have a portfolio.Like in India, we have smallcase is anequivalent, where you buy a portfolioof stocks representing some idea,whether it is Dividend, or Momentum Strategy,or All-Weather, or Safe Investments,but there is nothing equivalent in the US.ETFs are there but you would still haveto research about those ETFs as tohow did they perform, so on and so forth.So Vested has launched somethingcalled Vest, and Vest is a bunch ora portfolio of stocks that you can buy.As you can see on the screen,let's say you want to buy a Vest of SAS.SAS means software as a service,so all the companies like AWS, Shopifywhich provide software as a serviceto global customers, so you can buythe stocks of all the top companiesin SAS in just one go.It is a paid service so it is not free.Please check the charges before buyingbut it is a great way for you to startbecause you will have to adopta thesis in this, thatI want to invest in SAS or technologyor in Big 4 or Top 100, so on and so forth,as against thatI want to invest in this stock or that stock, et cetera.Viram give us a broad overview aboutthis as well, of what Vest is, and it issuch a helpful tool for early investorswho want to invest in the US market.Aditya address point problem 3, VestThen nextFourth, you have invested in the stock market,you've got a good return as well,now you want to bring that money back to India.There are two problems,Number 1, it is very expensive.It costs anywhere, upwards of $35 for youto bring that money back to India,which is like reducing your return as it is.The second, same problem,there is no visibility about where the money is,when will it reach you, so on and so forth.Vested has solved for that as well.$35 is now significantly less,I think it is $11 now, which is great,and they are working towardsreducing it even further.The second, just like Vested Direct,it has 100% traceabilityYou would know where your money is,and in how many days it is likely to hityour Indian bank account, so it is a great wayfor you to make a quicker andcheaper withdrawals.Problem 4 at this point. Whatever Viramsays about this, you can just bring that in.If it seems that he is repeating whateverI am saying then you can drop that as well.Not necessary to bring him in this.Last and the fifth problem is around taxation.If you buy stocks in the US, or for that matterwhenever you buy any stocks irrespectiveof the country, then understanding short-termand long-term capital gain tax.The second is the tax on dividends.You are buying for selling a stock in the US,which means that your capital gain taxand your dividend tax needs to be dealtwith in the US Income Tax regime.This becomes very complicatedbecause people do not knowhow to apply it in Indian returns?How to safeguard it?What are the taxation documents?What is actually the PnL? so on and so forth.So Vested has fixed all of that.You will have all the tax documentationwhich you need to file your taxes in India.The good thing is India and the UShave a tax treaty, so any tax of yourswhich is in the way of dividend,if you are on a dividend in the USthen your tax is withheld which meansyou do not get the full amount,the withholding tax which is I think25% is deposited, but when you arefiling your Indian return, then that 25% taxwhich the US had withheld on your behalf,you can claim that.To claim that you need documentationwhich is what thisTo claim that you need documentationwhich is what Vested helps you with.More importantly, to calculate long-termand short-term capital gain,depending on how much was your gainyou have to bear the tax on it in India,Vested provides you all the documentationto calculate that as well.Essentially, all the documents for taxationwhich your CA will need to fileyour taxes appropriately,Vested provides you all of thosethrough this process.So, these 5 problems,how do you transfer moneycheaply with traceability?Second, how do you get a deeper analysisof the stocks that you are buying?Third, how do you start with a portfolioor an idea instead of startingwith specific stocks?Fourth, how do you get your money backcheaply and with traceability?And lastly, how do you get all thetaxation documents in one place?All of this has been fixed by Vested.Frankly, these were the 5 big problemsthat I had when I started investing inthe US market sitting in India.Now all those problems are solved.Now I have become such an active investorwhere almost every month,just like I do a SIP, I consistentlysend money to the US, I keep buyingand selling whatever it is that I have toand I have not got the money back till nowexcept for one time when I needed it,but I have kept that money thereand I know that it is safe with Drivewealthbecause it is an accredited investment firmand most importantly, I am doing itthrough an app that I believe inbecause it is backed by the best investors,it is backed by supreme technology,and any product which keeps inmind the problem of the consumerand solves it, always has my attention.Please consider starting yourUS stock investing journey through Vested.I hope this was useful.If you have any questions any doubts,please do not forget to ask in thecomment section.Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday,videos on YouTube at 9:30 pm sharp.If you want to be notified aboutall those videos,then do not forget to subscribe.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
