Check 1, 2.Vidur is our 11 year oldson, Uzma is 5 years old,and when both of themwere born,especially when Vidur was born,I was very scaredof one thingand that is the fact thatfor 18 years he will have togo through the same school routinewhich I went through.And the fear was thatthe same thing shouldnot happen with himwhich I oftensee happening with school students.And that is notsomething we realizeuntil much later.I had read a very interestingquote whereI had read a veryinteresting quote that'Once we are out ofschool and college,we spend our entire lifetrying to undowhat school and collegetaught us'.In this video, Iam not making it topreach down school oreducational system,or to preach down collegeeducational system.I am not making itto do preach it down.In this video,I have only one objective -that there should be this awarenessthat school or college, maybein some way,some where or the other,has made us incapable.And if you have that awarenessthen you can correct it.But let's start withthe fun facts andthe positive facts.What did I get fromschool and college,which I am sure even you got -I got friends, social interactions,of course I got to learn a lot,I got a lot of exposure,I got many experiences,I got to know myself,understand myself,there were a lot ofopportunities, speciallyin college, to meetdifferent people,people would come fromall over the country,I studied in DelhiUniversity's Hindu College, soin North Campusthere was a differentatmosphere, I met somany people,I met my wife in college,we used to traveltogether in the bus.So there were somereally wonderful partsbut,there were specifically 3things3 thingsthat I felt'I wish school and collegedid not do'.The first one -the conceptand the approach towardsexaminations.In school and collegewe were taught avery important thing,and that is, that within one year,we willteach you one subject or course.It will start at one time,all students willlearn the same thing,and then at one timethere will be an evaluationwhich we call exam.This is irrespective ofwhether you understood or not,it does not matterto us whether you areare too fast or too slow.We will evaluateevery individual at the same time.And when you will give that exam,if you score well,then you will pass,if you do not score well,then you will fail.And that was the centreof the educationalprinciple.Now this,with many thingsactual,Now this,is very different from real life.Let me explain how.Our entire focusas students would bethat we clear the particularsubject's exam.We would notfocus much on learningor on understandingas much as we would focus onclearing the exam.Exam would be cleared.And of course ifyou were a diligent studentyou wanted a certain number, if youdid not care, youjust wanted to pass,if you were just scaredthat you should not fail.Thisbecame 80%-90% of our attention.And just as the examwould end,you were like -'Boss!I won't have to studythis subject again.That Organic Chemistry examhas ended!That Accountancy paperhas ended! That Journalism orGeography or Historyor whatever else youwere studying, its paperhas ended. Now we won't everhave to study this again.'And that became our high point.And then the new class would start,a new subject would start,a newThen a new class starts,a new subject starts,a new routine starts,and we keeprepeating the same thingand same thing, and same thing.And then,we get out in the real world.And we think that the real worldwill also work in the same waythat we will be given one thing,we will have to endlesslyfocus on that thing,there will be one exam,we will clear thatexam, and then thisthing will not comein our life again.A new thing will come.But that's not howreal lifeworks. If you work,then you know this,if you do not work,then I can tell you this thatin real life,you won't get a chanceto pass the exam.You don't have to pass exams,you don't have to give tests,you are not taught firstand then given a test.Instead, only one thingis demanded from you -can you dothe same thingover and overand over and over and over again,getting better at itevery time you do it?Can you do only one thingagain and againand again and again?And every time,better thanthe last time?That, is how real lifeworks. But ourschool and college's trainingbuilds us in a verydifferent mindset.So we always seeour work,our real life andeven our relationshipsin the form of an exam.We think that let'sclear this exam,then again thissubject won't come,syllabus won't come,course won't comeand we will move ahead.But, no, my friend,you have to keeprepeating the samething over and overagain, and thatis the big difference.If you are not stuck inthis clutch of school and college,that is your gift.If you are stuck,get out of it.Number 2 -related to exam itself,but not exactly exam,a broad perspective -that every questionhas one right answer.And if you give that right answer,then you are correct,if you do not givethat right answer,then you are wrong.And,giving the answeristhe role of a student.This, is whatirritates me themost about school and college.My biggest fearwhen we were looking for aschool for Vidur and Uzma,was this thatGod forbid, theygo to such a schoolwhere only and onlyright answers will be taught,anfd answering will be taught,they will lose what it isto learn in life.Because in life,you don't learn from questions.BecauseWhen we were looking for aschool for Vidur and Uzma,my biggest fear was thatGod forbid, theygo to such a schoolwhere they will be told thatthere is only one right answerand answering is your only role,then they will learnnothing about life.Because the realityis that you learnlife not through answers,but through questions.The more questions you can ask,the more you will know.Everybody knows answering,either by learningor by understanding.But asking questionsis an art.And very few people can do it.Because in school and college,asking questions wasnot allowed at all.We would be scolded at,rebuked, that how many questionsdo you ask, are you dumb,don't you understand,are you mad,does anybody ask such questions?Then our parents would also say -how many questions do you ask,can you keep quiet,everything is not a question.Because when we were kids,we would ask only questions.'Why is the moon round?','Why are there stars?','Why is the dog barking?','Why is the cat crying?',everything was a question for us,everything was curiousity-driven.Now imagine,slowly, slowly,you stop asking questions.We have forgotten whatwe were in childhood.Why? Because overthe years,someone has taught usand stuffed it in our mindthat not the question,but the answer is important.And if the answer is correct,you top.If the answer is wrong,then try again,till you don't getthe right answer.Because there isonly one right answer.Wrong wayof thinking about life.There are multiple right answersbut, the best way to learn lifeis to ask questions.And then the third thing -few colleges are moving away from this, butmany collegesare yet the same way.Attendance.Attendance is very important.If the attendance isn't there,then you are in trouble.Minimum 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%.Few colleges, like BITS Pilani,have scrapped offthe attendance rule.There is no need,there is no minimum,you can come if you want to,if you don't want to come,it's okay.There will be an examand you have to pass the exam,if you do it, very good,if you don't,that is your problem.Because school and collegethinksattendance is important.While I think,not attendance,but attention is necessary.What will you do keeping onenon-attentive individualin your classwhose mind is wanderingsomewhere else?They might be on WhatsApp,or sleeping,or are hungry,it can be anything.But the idea isbecause they are present there,physically, not mentally,you think it's correct.But it's not.What is required in life to winis attention,not attendance.And this wrong trainingrepulses us to such an extentthat we think weshould run. So we stoppaying attentionand giving our attendanceto almost everything in life.We move awayso much from that moment.You might be talking to someone,you are on your phone. Personally,if I record the video like this,thatone minuteyeah okay, soso this I am recordingandwill this be fun?Will this be fun?Attendance is there,I am here,I am present,'Present ma'am, present sir'.There is no attention.And this becomesour innate personality.We start living lifein the same way.Whether it is in a relationship,whether it is parents,whether it is friends,whether it be office, whether it becolleagues or whether it is anyone.We cannot sit withourselves as well.We give our attendance within,but never give attention.We mark our attendancefor ourselves,but cannot give attention.We cannot sit with ourselves.And that is somethingthat school and collegedestroys and takes away from us.Always rememberin life, not attendance,but attention is necessary.When you think aboutthese 3 things,and you think about thatbecause of these 3 things,how your life has changed,how your thinking has changed,how your manner of doingand performing has changed,you begin to understand how,over years,you have been taughtwith only one training,only one worldview.You have been taught like that.And that can be harmful.So many years,you have been followingonly one regiment,only one routine, onone philosophy only,and you have beenfunctioning on that.And thatnaturally will become your life,naturally will becomethe way you thinkabout things. And suddenly thenat the age of 22-23 years, you willstep in real life,you will realize,"Boss, real life isnot how I imagined it!"So much is differentand you have to reimagineevery event yourself.So my objective in this video,again, is notto abuse the education system.There are many manybeautiful things.Now as well, singularly,the surest way to get out of yourfinancial distress,your social distress,your personal distress,is education.In our country, for sure.But, with that,these negatives are there as well.And if you can makeyourself aware of these negatives,then what you will be left withare only the positivesthe education system has to offer.I hopethat if you are a student,you will fulfill your role asa student keeping them in mind.If you have already fulfilled yourrole as a student and are working,then be awarethat how because of so many thingsyour manner of workingmight be wrong from what the worldneeds. And if you correct that,you will suddenly find yourselfin a completelynew growth phasethan what you are experiencing.I hope this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo,signing off.
