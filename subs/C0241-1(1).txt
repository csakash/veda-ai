Ok Shivam Aditya, again a big challengefor you Shivam because I am a littlefar away from the road, it's mostlyan empty road but people do keep comingso if they come you will have to take care of it.Ok let's get startedAditya I will tell you when I start the loom recordingWhat is invoice discounting?Should you invest in it?And if you should then what arethe risks attached with it?We will get to know in this video.Friends, since I have started to makevideos on personal finance,there is something called invoice discountingwhich a lot of people want to know about.I receive so many comments sayingPlease make a video on invoice discountingPlease tell us whether it isa good thing to invest in or notAnd disclaimer, I have never investedin invoice discounting and after whatI know about it, maybe I won't ever do it.But since so many people askedwhat is invoice discounting,whether one should do it or not,I was like, true to the concept of learningand understanding investing,why don't I make a video.Because of that even I will learn something new,I will be able to tell you something newand we will both benefit from this.So in this video, we will discussall the details of invoice discountingwhich are important to know before you makea decision of whether you should invest or not.Specifically, two thingsFirst of all, what is invoice discounting?What is its foundation,which is the word invoice?And how does it work?And secondly, how can you get a good returnby investing in invoice discountingbut at the same time what are therisks which you should know?What is invoice discounting?Invoice discounting isan invoice and discounting.An invoice means a bill.If you are a business and you haveworked as a business for another businessthen you raise an invoice for themwhich forms the basis forthem to make a payment.So the most important criteria ofinvoice discounting is an invoice,and two people are involved in this.One who generates the invoice which meansthe person who is going to get the payment.And the second on whose name the invoiceis generated means the personwho is going to make the payment.Both of them a very importantbecause the investing asset calledinvoice discounting, determines for both of them,whether this investment would be safeand if it would be safe then to what limit?We will get to know this but before that,let's try and understandthe fundamental of an invoice.Let's take an example.Suppose you are a t-shirt manufacturer,you make t-shirts as a business,so you as a business make t-shirtsfor other businesses, not for normal consumers.And one of your customers is Amazon.Now Amazon says to you that we wantto give a new t-shirt to our lakhsof delivery partners in India,we want to change their T-shirts.I love how I use this Delhi EnglishSomehow it comes out in a flowAnd they have given you an order of1 lakh T-shirtsAnd after a lot of negotiations,because Amazon is a great negotiating taskmaster,they said that we will give youâ¹500 for these t-shirts.Now don't go by whether â¹500 is less or notthat is not the basis for this conversationSo you received an order of 1 lakh Tshirtfor â¹500 per t-shirt, so when you willdeliver these t-shirts to themso for how much would be the invoicethat you will raise for them?1 lakh into â¹500 which isâ¹5 crores plus GST etc. etc.But basic, the money that you will getwill be 1 lakh into 500 which is â¹5 croresTo do all of this, you also haveto bear some expenses as a business.You will have to buy the raw materiallike cloth for T-shirt, buttons,if you want to get something printedthen the expense for that, salariesof workers, the expense of runninga business, factory, machines,and after adding all of these youget to know that your actual costis about â¹350.This means to make 1 lakh T-shirtyou will have to spend â¹350,now this is where a problem arises.You are a small business,till now you have made T-shirtsfor small businesses.Now suddenly you have got a big businessfrom Amazon, they have given you anorder of â¹5 crores, but to deliveran order of â¹5 crores, you will haveto spend â¹3.5 crores, which is the entireraw materials, salary, whatever it is,and that is money you don't have.Now if you are a small business,maybe a bank will not give you a loanbecause you do not have a credit history,or maybe you have just started in thelast 6-12 months so you do not havea basis to show, or you have never donesuch a big business that you will getsuch a big loan, so who do you go to?You go to people who can give you this loan.This loan is called a working capital loan.Working capital is the mostfundamental cost of a small business.Since you may get that money aftersome time but to get that moneywe have to spend some amount today itself,then there is a deficit of cash inflow and outflow.Over and above this, there issomething called credit period.Now since Amazon is a big company,they say the day you will give us the invoice,whenever you will present askthe bill on basis of which we willhave to make the payment, we will makethe payment after 90 days of it for X days,it is usually 90 days, 60 to 90 days.This means that you have to spend moneynot just in the beginning you will alsohave to wait for 3 months for thatmoney to come to your bank account.So now you have to bear the expensefor those 3 months also.You have to pay the salaries,run the office, business, machines,so on and so forth, this is working capital.Money which you need not because you area loss making company, but because youwill get cash later but you haveto bear the expenses today only.So invoice discounting came to helpsuch businesses, and they said if banksare not able to solve the problem ofworking capital then is thereanybody else who can do it?Then they realized that they weremany people like HNIs who have a lot of money,High Networth Individuals;NRIs who have a lot of money,they could be there;institutional investors who arenot as big as banks but they still lend to people,and they went to them with a verysimple proposition, which we will tryto know and understand through an excel sheet,Let's play Excel Excel, it will be fun!Ok at this point of time I am goingto put on my Excel sheet AdityaOkAs you can see on the Excel sheet,We started with 1 lakh unitsSelling price is â¹500Cost price is â¹350This means that the invoice we willraise for Amazon will be forâ¹5 crores and our expensein this is â¹3.5 croresThis means our margin is 43%How come?How much did we earn onour expense of â¹3.5 crores?â¹1.5 crores which is 5 minus 3.5So that ratio is 43 %So now you need 3.5 croresor maybe 5 crores because you hadsome other expenses as well,whatever the case may be.Now why would anybody give you this?Because you will give them a discounton this value which is why the term'Invoice Discounting'The invoice that you have that formsa basis for someone to give you a discount.So you will go to someone who couldbe an investor and tell them that you havea â¹5 crore invoice from a personwho is highly respected, reputedand trustworthy, so money will definitelycome but after 90 days.So if you give me the â¹5 crores todaywith a discount, which I will give you,then you will get a total of â¹5 croresafter 90 days while I will geta discounted outcome of these 5 crorestoday itself.Let's use this with numbers.Let's say I am ready to give a discountof 5% so I am ready to give you this invoiceof â¹5 crores in â¹4.75 crores,which means a discount of â¹25 lakhs.And since you will do that,now what is your new margin?Now you will not get â¹5 crores,now you will get â¹4.75 croresSo your cost if still â¹3.5 croresbut now you are not earning 1.5 crotres,now you are earning 1.25 crores,which means your margin now goes downfrom 43% to 36% as T-shirt manufacturer.So you like, it's fine36% is good enough, if I am gettinga profit of 1.25 crores instead of 1.5 crores,but if I get the money today itself,I am willing to do that,which is why as a business you willeven offer this discount to someone.Now let's understand, how will it workfor the person who bought this?You will get this money after 90 days on the invoice...You will get this money after 90 dayson the invoice, which means that youto earned 5% in those 90 days of a certain value.Now if you extrapolate this and calculatethe yearly income, which ishow we measure what is the return, right?We say that stocks give us x percent return,it is always on the basis of an yearNow since this is an investment of only 90 days,so we will have to calculatethe annual investment for thisand that will come to 20%, which is365 into 5% divided by 90 days,so it comes around 20%Now in this, if a platform, which isa new entity that has now emergedinto the scheme,I am a platform which says that thisinvoice which is come from a business,and this is from a party which...I say that my job was to find this invoiceand bring it to you which means one businesshas got the invoice from Amazon,an invoice which Amazon has to pay,my job was to look for this invoiceand bring it to you, and to do that,I will give you 15% out of these 20%that we will earn and I will keep 5%,which means I will give you 15% returnon this asset which is great, right?Because it is fixed, there is no volatilityin it there is no fluctuation in thisas it happens in the stock market.This is like, you invest your moneyand you will get a return of 15%on an annual basis.I will tell you how,not in the actual terms which isa slight problem with this.But you will get a return of 15%,which is great!And I as a platform will keep 5%which is what my fee is to dothis hard work of finding the invoice.So now if you calculate this,how much will you earn in 90 days?Since you are earning 15% in a year,so in 90 days you will earnaround 3.7% and platform willmake around 1.2%, this is theactual absolute return.Why?Because you are not investingfor a year, you are investingonly for 90 days.So how does it work?Initially there were 3 parties in the invoiceInvoice, the ones who generated thatinvoice meaning who will get that money,and on whose name is the invoice raisedmeaning who will make the payment.And the ones who had to get the moneythrough this invoice, they said I wantthe money today but money will comeonly after 90 days so I am ready togive a discount of 5% on this invoicehence the invoice discounting.Is there anybody who is ready to buy it?And they did not have a way of finding this.Earlier they used to sell it to HNIs,NRIs and institutional investors,but now there are platforms wherethese invoices are listed.So you and I as a retail investorcan go to these platforms,and see that there is a companyby the name of Warikoo garmentswhich has to generate invoice for Amazon...and see that there is a companyby the name of Warikoo garmentswhich has generated an invoiceon Amazon's name for â¹5 croreswhich is payable in 90 days,and they are ready to sell thisinvoice in â¹4.75 crores.Now if I have that money asa retail investor, I will say,'Cool, you take 4.75 crores from me.After 90 days these â¹4.75 croreswill become â¹5 crores, which meansin just 90 days I will earn â¹25 lakhs'.But how would I know if thisinvoice even exists or not?The platform does it for meSo the fourth entity which entersthis is, all the invoice discounting platforms.Platforms like Kredx, TradeCred,the job of these platforms is tofind and list legitimate, bonafide,accurate, legally proven invoices,and then let you decide that whichinvoice do you want to invest inand for how much amount?Typically the investing amount startsfrom a few lakhs, the minimum amountusually is 3-5 lakhs.You cannot invest only â¹10000,so on and so forthTo give you an example,if you invest â¹5 lakhs in thissame example we were working on,then after 90 days you will getâ¹5,18,500 which means in 90 daysyou would have earned around â¹18,500as interest income which will add upin your other income and then it willbe deducted according to your tax slabfrom a capital gains perspective,that is a separate conversation.Now what are the risk involved in this?What are its negatives and positives?Let's start with a positivebecause that's the right wayThe biggest positive is it isfixed return meaning you don't haveto worry about its fluctuation,you will get the return which ispromised by that platform to you after90 days, that is fixed.Number 2, it is short-term,which means within 90 days,usually within 60-90 days,you get all your money back.So if you want to make any investmentin a short term asset, then this is thebest asset to make investment in.But what are its negatives?First of all, the biggest one is credit risk.Credit risk means, god forbid ifsomething happens that the personon whose name the invoice was raised,they are not able to make the payment,then your money is gone,which is why it becomes very importantto invest in an invoice which israised in the name of a respected,reputed, and trustworthy company.I did not take Amazon's name randomly,I took it because amazon is a companywhich makes its payments on timeand does it come what may,so you would want to have an invoicethat you invest in which is raised inthe name of a company where thereis no credit risk, number 1.Number 2, dispute riskDispute risk means, Ankur Garmentshas delivered the T-Shirts to Amazon,but there was some flaws in those t-shirts,so Amazon said, 'Its disputed,I will not make the payment'.How do you take care of that?That is why the second thing is,the person who has raised the invoice,the company whose invoice you arebuying and investing in, thatshould also be reputed. It cannotbe a random company becauseif you have never heard of Ankur Garments,it doesn't have a history,if they made pathetic t-shirtsthen your money can get stuckand that is something that you would not want.The third is insolvency riskWhich means something happensbecause of which these two companiesdo not exist, they are not in a stateto give the money, then your money getstuck again, which is why this assetis risky, and I personally do not investin this because in short-term,in 90 days I do not get a phenomenal interestfrom an absolute amount thatI am investing in this risk.For example, even after investing â¹5 lakhs,I am earning only â¹18500.Now to earn â¹18500 I will not wantto take so much risk, this ispersonally my approach, I am notsaying that you should not do it.If you are young, if you have juststarted investing, I would much ratherbe extremely happy if you investin long-term assets.Those assets in which you are investingin a disciplined manner.Those assets in which you know by thepower of compounding over a long-termyou can earn good money.But if you have already done many suchinvestments, you have a big corpus of equities,of US market, maybe a little bit of Crypto,maybe a little bit of real estate,maybe a little bit of gold,hopefully no fixed deposits,then invoice discounting could be agreat asset for you to park yourmoney for short-term period.At the end, my suggestion would bethat if you have excess money,if you want to do short-term investing,then invoice discounting could bea great way for you to explore.But if you have just startedand you don't have a corpusand want to invest monthly thenthis may not be the right asset for you.There are many platforms that youcan use to discover invoicesfor invoice discountingI have heard of KredexI have heard of TradeCredI haven't heard of any other soI am really sorry if I am not naming anyone.This is not a promoted postThere is no intention to youmention some and not mention some othersPlease go out and explore all theinvoice discounting platforms thatexist and you can use to invest init and if it works for you I willbe more than happy for you.If you have any doubts or questionson invoice discounting, then pleasedo not forget to us in the comments section.A video every Tuesday Thursday and Saturday,3 videos every week.Subscribe to get notified about thosevideos whenever they go live.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off!Ok Shivam, rain started in the middle,I was sitting outside, there was noise,I am sorry, you will have to do something about it,all the best my friend.
