Check 1 2I just recorded a26-minute video and after13 minutes the memory cardwent full.Ok, let's do this again.How did I spend the moneythat I earned in 2021,we'll get to know in this video.Friends, at the end of 2021,I made a video,how much money I made in 2021?A lot of people appreciatedthat video,thank you so much for that,it was genuinely a verydifficult video to makeand I wasn't sure ofhow it will be receivedbut your love, your supportmeant the world to me.Because of that video, a lot of peopleasked me a question which is,'All the money that you earn,how do you spend it,because earning â¹12 croresin a year is not a joke?'That's why I decidedto make this video.Number 1, â¹12 croreswhich I earned in 2021,was not earned by me butby my company.A lot of expenses wereattached to it.There were marketing expenses,team expenses,hardware expenses,office expenses,blah blah blah.So â¹12 crores is the income.The profit from it wasof course far lesser.Secondly, as I said,this is the company's income,not my personal income.My wife and I are directorsin that company, so we drawa simple salary every month,but we keep the company's profitas it is, because we want tosave for future investmentswhich we will do towards buildingthe startup that we are building.So this video will be aroundthe personal incomeand thus the personal expensesI had in 2021.My wife and I draw a salaryof â¹4 lakhs per month each,and that is the basis forall our expenditures thatwe do at a personal level.Of course, all thecompany's expenses are outside,but this video will be aboutpersonal expenses, andhow I spend my money in 2021.First of all, let's start...Come with me, and let's try toknow through an excel sheet,where did I spend my money in 2021?Let's play with Excel!So as you can see,Ankur and Ruchi earned â¹4 lakhsper month, so â¹48,00,000 annually each.And that means as a familywe have an inflow of â¹96 lakhsevery year.According to our tax planning,we give a tax of 26% on average,which means in hand, after allthe deductions, we get â¹71 lakhs.Now I will tell you everysingle expense item for usas a family in 2021.Why do I even know all this?Because I intensely track my money.That's something thatI have said quite often!If you do not measurewhere your money is going,you will never be able toget smart about it.In fact, that's true foreverything in life.If you want to be good at anything.You want to measure your timeeffectively,you want to get good numbers,you want to raise your incomeeffectively, you will have tostart measuring how is itthat you are arriving there,because that focus makesthat metric move in theright direction.So I measure all my money properly,and I budget it as well.I made a video on budgetingcalled the 50:30:20 rule,where 50% of your money shouldideally go towards your needs,which you will have to spendin your daily life.It could be your rent, EMI,food expense, electricity expense,utilities, the money thatyou have to spend on all yourdaily household needs.30% towards your wants,your desires.You want to buy a phone,a car, clothes,whatever the case may be,those are your desires,and no more than 30% of yourincome should go towardsthat category.And finally, your investments,which should be a minimum of20%, ideally a lot more.So 50:30:20 rule tells you that,50% towards needs, 30% towards wants,and 20% towards investments.If you adopt this planning,you will ensure that you haveenough to survive, you enjoylife while also investing.So in all this categorization,I will tell you about whatI spent my money on,how much I spent,and which of these 3 categoriesdoes it belong to.And then, in the end,I will show you the portfolio mixof the needs, wants,and investments.First of all, and this is inincreasing order, clothes.So we have two kids, two of usare also there, school uniforms,daily clothes,whatever the case may be,so in 2021, we spent aroundâ¹19,000 on clothes.This is not our need,this is our want.That t-shirt is so nice!Such a great sale!Amazing shoes!So we have put all those thingsin wants, even if it is school uniform,and that is what we started with.Next is health insurance.Health Insurance is very very critical.I have put it under needs,because this for me, is afundamental critical inputto living life.All four of us have afamily floater plan witha cover of â¹9 lakhs.We give a premium of â¹19,000 towards...Next is health insurance inwhich we have spent around â¹20,000,this is the premium that we payfor the health insurancefor our family.We have a family floater planwith a cover of â¹9 lakhs,which is enough I think forthe two of us and our kids,because all of us are still young.And this is separate fromthe parents' health insurance.So we have separatehealth insurance for parentswhere we pay around â¹55,000.Of course, my parents give that,and their plan is a coverof â¹12 lakhs, because of courseat their age they need that cover.And for me, this is a need,not a want, because this issomething that I firmly believeis a critical start to yourfamily spends.Next is eating out.Ordering in is also includedin eating out,so we don't order in much,and we order the most from Dominos.We love Pizza a lot! A lot!I really love it!And sometimes we order pizza,or if we go out with friends,or ourselves, then all the expensethat is included in these â¹22,000.It is a rounded-off figurebecause I could not findthe exact numbers,sometimes we paid in cash also,but this is the approximate amountthat we spent in 2021 in eating out.This doesn't include home cook food,this is only food from outside,and that is why it is in want.This was not our need.It wasn't that if we didn't eat out,we would starve to death.We could have easily had it at home,but this was something we desired,and that is why it is our want.After this, kids library.So both our kids have alibrary subscription and we haveto pay â¹25000 per yearfor that access.It seems to be a lot of moneybut it is fascinating how...It seems to be a lot of moneybut for us, this is anabsolutely great investmentthat we would make for our kids.In fact, Vidur and I weretalking about it this week itself,where I was trying to explainto him a fixed asset business.He was asking me,'Papa, we pay â¹12500 for it,isn't it expensive?I mean, we can buy so manybooks for â¹12500?!'And I was like,'This is the wrong way tothink about it Vidur,because let's do the math.'Then we did the math.I asked him,'How many books do youread in a week?'He is a very fast readerso he reads around 6 booksin a week.These are mostly comic books,so they are graphic novels,so it doesn't take a lot,but he is a very voracious reader.So he said, '6 books.'So they go to the librarytwice a week, and they can pickup 3 books every time, so 6 books.And I was like,'How much are these books for?'Now, these are international books,very high-quality books,so he said,'One book is for â¹700 which ishow much we would have paid ifwe were to buy that book.'So I was like,'Vidur, calculate what is thevalue of books that you readin a year?'So he did that and he was like,'Ok, there are 6 books,each is for â¹700.If I go 50 times in a year,which is for 50 weeks,then he's like â¹2,10,000!And we pay only 12500 for it?!This is a great deal!'I was like,'See! See the difference?!You felt that we are paying â¹12500,but now you will realizethat you are getting a benefitof â¹2 lakhs from it.'Then he went a step furtherand he was like,'Then why is ma'am doing it?'Because that's what hisnext question was.'This is a very foolish business,that you are taking â¹12,500 from me,and you have to buy booksworth â¹2 lakhs!'I was like,'Great! Ma'am is not foolish!Let's say by spending â¹2 lakhs,ma'am wants to earn â¹3 lakhsfrom it, so to how many studentswill she have to sell themembership to make that money?300000 divided by 1250024 students.How many children are therein your class Vidur?'He was like, '8 children.'I asked, 'how many classesare there?'He said, 'a lot!'I said, 'Great! Even if only24 children take the subscriptionof this library, on thisinvestment of â¹2 lakhs, ma'am willget â¹3 lakhs, which means she willmake a profit of â¹90,000.So it's great for ma'am also.So you see how it is greatfor everybody?'That's how he got it.And this is why we would alsomake this investment because,for us, kids going through books,and getting high-quality booksis definitely somethingwe would want to do.Next is subscriptions.These are the subscriptionswe have to pay monthly.Internet, Netflix, Amazon Prime,Sony LIV, all those things,so we have all the subscriptionsso that we get maximum discount.So we spent â¹28,632 in the year2021 on subscriptions.Next is books.So we could not find a libraryfor us like our kids,so we have to buy books,we are more than happy to do that.This doesn't have a budget.Whatever we spend will be less.So these are all the purchaseswe made on Kindle or buyinghard copies of the books.We spent around â¹29,000 in 2021for buying books and that wasthe category of want,because it is still a want,while this can easily be in my head,an investment category,but I was like, let's bea little aggressive,and put it under wants,let's not show that everythingis an investment for us.Let's just be very very sharpabout it.Gifts.Ruchi and I love to give giftsto people, and you would havealso perhaps figured,I love to do giveaways,all of that comes out ofcompanies budget.But personally, if it'sanybody's birthday,gifts for maids and security guardson Diwali, all those thingsare done in â¹36000,so we love buying.In fact, this amount isvery little because 2021was like a covid year,so we didn't step out a lot,there were not a lot of birthday partiesor anything like that,so whatever little it was,it was 36.In a normal year, it easilycomes around â¹50K-60K,and then we have to adjust itsomewhere else.Next is electricity and maintenance.So we live in a gated communityin Faridabad where we haveto pay maintenance chargesplus electricity charges.So all of that comes around â¹1,32,000,from which around â¹9,000 ismaintenance charge per month,and then the rest was for electricity,so â¹1,32,000 is what we paid for this.Life insurance, again very critical.10 years back, at the age of 31,I took life insurance,it was a term plan of â¹10 crores,and it was for a term of 20 years.This means that if I diein the next 20 years,then my family, the nominee,in this case, Ruchi will getâ¹10 crores, which in my opinion,was enough for them to take careof the rest of their life ifanyone is not able to earn.It sounds like a ridiculouslyhigh amount because in aterm plan there is no money back.So if I do not die in 20 years,which I would want thatI should not die then I would notget any money back, and peoplewill think like it isa ridiculous investment.Why would anyone do it?But the way to thinkabout this is the following.If I do this 143 into 20,which is the years thatI will be paying it for,then in 20 years,I will be giving aroundâ¹29 lakhs to the insurance company.But I want to calculate,how much would these â¹29 lakhsbe as a function of theâ¹10 crores which I can get?And that is 3%.So if I change the way I said it,and I say, at the age of 31 years.What is the probability of medying in the next 20 years?At the age of 31 years.What is the probability of medying in the next 20 years?Is it 3%?I would say that's a veryreasonable assumption.In fact, if I adjust itwith inflation, becauseevery year the â¹1,43,000that I'm paying, its valueis decreasing, so it willcome down to around 1.5-2%.1.5-2%, meaning is thatthe probability of me dyingin the next 20 years atthe age of 31?The answer is conclusively yes.I think it's a very good number.Then I would happily paythat 1-2% for a â¹10 crorecover as premium, right?That's what I have done!That's simply what I have done!I basically give a verysmall amount, 1.5-2%,to buy a very large coverso that my family iscompletely insured.For me, this is a need.It is not a want, it is clearlynot an investment, it is a needthat I don't want to live lifewith the fear that ifsomething happens to me tomorrow,then my family might have tocome on the roads.Next is food expenses.So our food expense,whatever we make at home,whether their fruits, vegetables,oil, ghee, all of that comesunder this, which is â¹2,64,000for the whole year, and again itwas a need because we need thismuch money to live life ona daily basis.Next is car rental and petrol.We do not own a car,we have not bought a car,we have taken a car for rent.Why?For one single amount,I get insurance, maintenance,ownership of the car,it is absolutely my car.We have taken a plan from Nissan,so we have their automatic version.We pay around â¹25000 per month for it.It is brilliant, right?I don't have to rack my brains.I simply call and the cargoes for service, I calland the car is insured.Everything at the beckand call of my call.And I have the flexibilitythat if tomorrow I want totake some other car, upgrade,or anything else,I can always do that,and the only thing we will haveto change will be the rental amount.Petrol, there was not much movementin 2021, so the expense on petrolwas very little, and that is whyaround â¹3,61,000 was what we spent.This is a want, so I have putall of it in want,though some of it is a need.Car is a mode of transportation,and it is important,but I thought let's be aggressive,so I have put everything in want,and that is why all of it isin the wants category.Next is home expenses.So all the expense on our helps.House help, cook, the guywho irons clothes, newspaper guy,all of them plus the grocery,soap, shampoo, all those things,all of them together come to beâ¹3,48,000 or around â¹3.5 lakhs,which is the annual expensefor us as a family.This is a need, 100%.The help can go under thecategory of want becausewe are capable of working ourselves,but for us, at least for me,this is a great investment tomake to free up my time.So I put it under the categoryof need, because their helpallows us to do a lot morewith our time, and if youcan afford it, then absolutelywhy not.Next is travel.So this is for vacation.Our whole family loves to travel,we couldn't do it much in 2021,but if we would then it clearlywould be around â¹6-7 lakhs,if it would be international,then it could go up to â¹10 lakhsalso, but we did a few small trips,so this is the amount that wespent which was about â¹5 lakhs.It is absolutely a want.If we wouldn't have done it,we would very well be aliveand as happy, but sincewe love traveling,we love experiences,so that's why we would makethis investment any day.Next is the school fees forVidur and Uzma.This is a mega-investment,â¹10 lakhs annually.It's because they go to anexpensive school,an international school,and we want to make that investment.So I have put it under needs,though some percentage of it isin wants, because it is aninternational school,they could go to a normalschool too. But for us,to send them to thishigh-quality school,to give them that high-qualityeducation is something thatwe would absolutely want to do,and since we are at a positionin life where we can afford it,then why not!Because ultimately you areshaping someone's life,perhaps forever.House EMI.So, this is our biggest loan.In fact, the only loanthat we have right now.It is a loan of aroundâ¹1,30,00,000 in the housethat we have taken,that's why it is a need,and not a want nor an investment.The EMI is around â¹1,45,000,and that is what we haveto pay to get that done.And then finally,our monthly investment,which we do with absolutededication, â¹24 lakhs a yearhave to be invested come what may!That is what we have to invest.The way that we have thoughtabout it is, some investmentsare for tax planning,so that we fall into theminimum bracket thatwe can possibly, which is 26%.But a large part of it isjust corpus that we arebuilding so that we canpay off this loan at some point.We are 41 years old right now,Vidur is 11 so he willgo to the college at theage of 18 years, so we havearound 7 years to plan forhis college.So our aim is that in thenext 2-3 years, if we workon these â¹24 lakhs and grow themto â¹1 crore in 4 years,if the return would be 30%,and in 4 years we would alsohave paid off some loan,then within 3-4 years,we should be able to pay offour home loan, and then we willdevote the next 3-4 years inbuilding the corpus forVidur's education.There's a difference of 6 yearsbetween Uzma and Vidur,so thankfully, once his expenseis completed, then for thenext 6 years he would workfor Uzma, that is how we areplanning to do it.But what you will see is,at the end of the monthwe are not left with any money.And that is actually true!A lot of people do not evenbelieve it when I say this,that there is never any moneyin my bank or Ruchi's bank.The minute we get money,all of them are deployed,in some investment accounts,or some payments,or some purchases,after doing all this,all that we have is afew cash amounts in the house,â¹20K-30K.There is a separate emergency fundwhich we never touch,and if there is any emergencybeyond it, if there isa health emergency thenhealth insurance, if there isany other emergency thencredit card usage, that ishow we think about it.We don't feel the need tohave money in our bank account.We are far far better offinvesting all of thatas soon as it comesand hits us.So these are the categoriesof spends, all the amounts,and the category of need, want,and investment.Now let's see, what thisportfolio looks like?For that, I will introducewhat's called a pivot table.I will bring the categories here,so these are our categories,investments, needs, and want.And then we will bringin the amount, so this is how it is.â¹71 lakhs that we get annually,from that, we spend â¹24 lakhson investment, around â¹37 lakhson our needs, and aroundâ¹10 lakhs on our wants.Now how much is this in percentage?The way to do that is,show value as a percentageof column total.When I do that, this is thenumber that you get.This means, our needs are 52%,close to the 50% that I had said,should be our budget.Our wants are 14%,so much lower than the 30%,and that's because we aremore than happy in this 14%,because the base is so big â¹70 lakhs,14% is good enough for usto cover our wants.And then the target of 20%for investments,we have increased it to 34%because we do haveinvestment goals for ourselves.Home loan expenses,children's education,then our retirement planning,which is what we will startworking towards once that is done.You will see this ishow we would want tomanage our money.I am a fanatic when itcomes to managing my money,because I have made so many,so many mistakes in life thatI do not want to repeat thosemistakes anymore.I have learned a lot fromthose mistakes, and at theage of 40 years, though Ihave learned late, but I havelearned so hard that I will notrepeat those mistakes!And that is why this entire planning.That is why I am sharing itwith you so that you canlearn from it, and at whateverage you are, start yourplanning at that very moment,and never let somebody elsetake charge of your...There are some firecrackersbursting today!On that note, this isAnkur Warikoo, signing off Tu!
