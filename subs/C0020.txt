How can you make a regular incomethrough your investments,we will get to know in this video.Friends, we have often spoken about SIPs.I hope you know that SIP is a regularand disciplined way of investing,where every monthwith absolute consistency,you invest a specific amounton a specific date.Usually, SIPs can be a way of investmentin mutual funds, stocks,and even smallcases,but this is a way for you to investfor the long term and towardsa financial goal.In this video, I will tell you aboutan opposite strategywhere you would investso that it generates a regular income.Because a lot of people ask me thisquestion that you teach how to invest,but the money that is being generatedthrough these investments,when and how should it be withdrawn?And that is explained through somethingcalled SWP.As SIP is a Systematic Investment Plan,SWP is a Systematic Withdrawl Plan.It is used in scenarios, where you havea lumpsum amount.Suppose, your parents have retiredand got a huge amount in PF or Gratuity,or you got a big amount after sellinga property,or you got a big bonus,or after doing a lot of investments,you have reached a pointwhere now you want to generatea regular income through them,then SWP is the right way to do it.What is the definition of SWP?Through SWP, you invest a regular amount,and then on a monthly, quarterly,or yearly basis, whatever you like,you regularly keep withdrawing money.So, this is a regular income.But it has a big caveat.If you keep withdrawing money,then the money will finishat some point in time, right?Then how does one think about that?And that is the main thing about SWPthat I want to tell you.How does SWP work,and keeping that in mind,how should you plan your withdrawals?Let's get to know.The first thing is a lot of mutual fundsgive the option of SWP, which meansthere are SWP-specific mutual fundsthat you will have to buy.When you do that, you usually makea lump sum purchase.So 1 lakh, 10 lakhs, 50 lakhs,whatever amount you want to investso that you can geta withdrawal amount from it.After that, every month,every quarter, every year,whatever amount you decideas your regular income,based on that, this mutual fundstarts selling its units.And after selling,whatever proceeds are made,that becomes your income.That is the way that it works.But this can be both, a debt instrument...So a big and important question is,when you invest in the mutual fund,where is that investing?Because the money that you are investingshould also grow,so that when you make withdrawals,your lump sum amountshouldn't get finished.Just like regular mutual funds,there are SWP mutual funds as well.They can invest in debt, equity,or a combination of both.Your rate of return would be accordingto your asset.If you invest in a debt instrumentor a fixed income mutual fund,then you will get a low rate of return.If you invest in a combination ofdebt and equity, then it will be higher.If you invest only in equity,then it will be even higher,but it also comes with volatility.I will give you an example ofan equity mutual fund to show youhow an SWP plan works.You can see on the screen,this is the 2017-2022 return of Nifty 50.No need to go into the details,basically all you have to seeis the movement of the stock marketin percentage.That is what we are trying to do,because the stock market by definition,goes up and down, so God forbidif you withdraw in the monthwhen the market is down,that will mean that you will losea lot more, and similarly,if you withdraw in the monthwhen the market is up,that would actually meana positive thing for you.How?Let's see.So, these are the returns,these are historic returns,but you can assume them to bethe returns of any 6 years,needn't be the case,but let's assume that you boughtthis SWP in the last year which is 2021,and now it's time for you to startmaking withdrawalsand let's see how that works.You can replace 2017-2022 with any year,the main thing is that you did SWPin the first year,and then started withdrawingin the next year.Let's assume that you startedwith â¹10 lakhs,so this was the investment that you made,and the mutual fund that you boughtits NAV or the Net Asset Value was â¹10.What is the NAV of a mutual fund?It is the equivalent of a stock price,so the price at which you are buyingthat mutual fund.Since you bought it at â¹10and you invested â¹10 lakh,you got 1 lakh units of this mutual fund.Awesome, with me so far?Let's move ahead.Now we will look at the growth ofthe NAV of the mutual fund.And I will just assume that asthe stock market rises,the mutual fund is also growing.This means, if it was for â¹10,and the market went up by 4.59%in that month,then the NAV would be 10.46 now,or 10.59 to be precise.Similarly, it would be 10.85, 11.21,11.37,so it will sometimes go up,and sometimes it will go downbecause the market will go down.In August, from 5.84%, it went downby 1.58%, so on and so forth,so the NAV also fluctuates accordingly.So what you will see is,every month the NAV of that mutual fundwill fluctuate according tothe stock market's fluctuation,and this is how the NAV will look like.This means, you started with â¹10,and now, after about 5.5 years,it's almost doubled, NAV of 90.75,and that would mean a good thing for you,not just for the stock marketbut it also for the withdrawal plan.How?You say that you need â¹10,000 every month,this is the amount that I needas my regular income.Now, where will these â¹10,000 come from?The mutual fund will sell unitsevery month to the amount of â¹10,000on your behalf,and then you will get those â¹10,000as your regular income.It's simple math.So how many units will be sold?In the first month,since the NAV is 10.46,so what you will do is,you will divide your amount of 10,000by the NAV,so 10,000 will be divided by 10.46,and the answer is 956.11 units.So you will sell 956.11 units,and you will then get your â¹10,000,so you will keep selling somethingevery month, and you will see thatas the NAV increases,the number of units required to be soldto get to your â¹10,000 is also reducing.Why?Because if the NAV is 90.75 now,then you will not have to sella lot of units, you will sellonly 500 units to get to â¹10,000,and that is how you are ridingon the growth of the marketwhile generating a regular incomefor yourself.So at the end of the entire cycle,how many units did you sell?45,612.11 units.How many units did we havein the beginning?1,00,000.So how many units are left?54,387.And now what is the value of these units?Units which is 54,387 into the NAVof the mutual fund today,which is 90.75, and that comesto â¹10,75,000.So what just suddenly happened?You invested â¹10 lakhsaround 5.5 years ago,earned a regular income ofâ¹10,000 every month,and then at the end of 5.5 years,you kept getting 10,000 every month,and you are still left with 10,75,000as the units in the mutual fund.That's the power of the SWP.That's the power of the withdrawal plan,if you withdraw properly withthe proper limit,and invest in the right mutual fundwhich continues to grow,you will not just generatethe regular income,but also the corpusat the end of that period.To understand this fully,I searched for a calculator,this is on Grow, thank you guys,you have put this calculator,this is not a paid promotion,but I just liked this calculator,so I am sharing it.Basically, this is an SWP calculator.It says,How much amount did you invest?Here is â¹5 lakhs, let's say we goto â¹20 lakhs, so let's make it,we have invested â¹20 lakhs.How much will we withdraw in a month?Let's say we want to withdraw â¹20,000.How much return are we expecting?If you invest in an equity mutual fund,then 11-12% is reasonable.If you invest in equity and debt,then 8-9%.If you invest in debt only, then 6-8%.That is the ballpark.I would insist, please invest in equity.Let's take it as 11%.Time-period?Let's say we are doing it for 20 years,and that's it.20 years!So you will see somethingvery interesting.You will see that as the years go by,look at the number below,the final value is decreasing,and that is because you arewithdrawing too much.So the growth is not ableto sustain your withdrawal.So by the time you come toaround 20 years,you will see that the amounthas gone into negative.This means, you kept gettingâ¹20,000 every month for 20 years,but all of a â¹20 lakhs got finished.You have still gotten more than thatbecause you got â¹20,000 every month,which is â¹2,40,000, which over 20 yearsmeans you withdrew â¹48,00,000 forthe â¹20 lakhs that you have invested,so you still got a lot more,but the corpus has finished.If I increase this 11 to 12,you will see that you willstill be left with a corpus.And that is how sensitive thisentire calculation is to the return.This is why I am saying if you takea mutual fund which gives lesser returnfor an SWP, you may not be ableto stick to the withdrawal,and that is something youneed to bear in mind.You can play with this calculatoras much as you want.What is very very important to note is,it works very well for long term periods,because I have entered 12% here,but as we saw in the sheet,you don't get 12% every year,it is not fixed,stock market does not behaveas guarantee fixed deposit,it will fluctuate every month,which means it fluctuates every year,so God forbid if you withdraw in a yearwhere there have been lot of lossesor negative returns, a lot of your unitswill be sold through this calculationthat we just did, and that may not bethe right thing for you.So long term is very important,because in the long term you getthe consistent returns of 11-12%in the stock market,and that is why the withdrawalmakes sense.A lot of research has been done onfiguring out what should bethe right withdrawal percentage or amount.I entered â¹20 lakhs,I would feel like withdrawingâ¹50,000 every month,but if I do withdraw â¹50,000 every month,let's just see if it goes,yes it took â¹50,000,now look at that,your money is finished in just 4 years.Naturally, right?Because if you withdraw â¹6 lakhsevery year, which is â¹50,000 a month,then how much burden can theseâ¹20 lakhs take of â¹6 lakhs withdrawal.The money is finished in 3-4 years.So there was a lot of research done,and what has been proven is,what has now become the 4% rule.4% rule is a broad concept,it's not the actual math,but what it says is,whatever is your lump sum amount,which let's say in this case is â¹20 lakhs,then how much would be 4% of â¹20 lakhs,and that comes to around â¹80,000.So if you withdraw â¹80,000 every year,which is broadly â¹7,000 every month,then you will never run out of money.Over a long period of time,10-20-30 years,you will continue sitting ona big corpus which will keep increasingwhile getting a regular income for you.Now this 4% rule has mostly been appliedon US stock market research,may not be applicable to India,so on and so forth,so use it for what it's worth,but it's a good percentage to start with.If I keep withdrawing 4-5% ofthe lump sum amount every year,which could happen monthly, quarterly,annually, however,then I am ensuring that I will keepgetting my regular income,but alongside that I am also increasingthe corpus of my investmentat the end of the period.That is the beauty of SWP.Now let's understand its associated costs.The first cost is what's calledthe expense ratio.To buy a mutual fund you have to givean expense ratio which goes towardsrunning the mutual fund.Any mutual fund whether it is SIP or SWPor anything else, you will always haveto bear an expense ratio,and that would bethe first cost associated.The second is the exit load.A lot of mutual funds say thatif you sell your mutual fund,then I would charge you for that also,which is called the exit load.A lot of mutual funds do not chargeexit load after 1 year,which is why if you buyan SWP mutual fund,then it is advisable that you shouldstart your withdrawal after one year only.So you invested these â¹20 lakhson the day one, then you will startthe withdrawal plan after one year only,not instantly,because if you start instantly,you may have to pay the exit load.And the third is taxes.You always have to give taxes.The good thing is there is no TDS in SWP,which means no tax is deducted,you will get the full capital gainor whatever amount you have withdrawn.But your capital gain will be taxed.If it is a long term capital gain,which means you sold it after 1 year,and it is within â¹1 lakh,then you will have to pay 10%on that 1 lakh.If it is a short-term capital gain tax,which means you sold it within a year,then you will have to pay 15%on the capital gain.Let's say you're withdrew â¹10,000,but its unit value which is basedon the NAV, that gain is only â¹500,then you will have to pay a taxof 15% on â¹500, that is how it will work.If you sell it after a year, then it'll belong term capital gain tax,the good thing about it is,capital gain tax of upto â¹1 lakhis waivered,and you will have to pay10% capital gain tax beyond â¹1 lakhas long term.That is why it is advised to startthe withdrawal plan after a year.You save not just on the exit load,you also save on your capital gain tax,because it changes from short termto long term.Finally, what are the disadvantagesof the risks associated with it?Number 1, you will have to startwith the lump sum amount,so that's a big disadvantage.If you are very earlyin your investing stage,you cannot do an SWP,you will have to do in SIP,and once you have a corpus,you can convert that into an SWP,which is why the best users for this is,if there is any retirement incomeof your parents, or there has beena windfall gain after sellinga property or something else,then you can use that as an SWPand generate a regular income.The second is that it is stillunpredictable because you arebetting on the stock market.If the market is up, you will get a gain,if the market is down,you will get a loss,because when the units will be soldfor your withdrawal amount,it is going to be dependenton the NAV of the mutual fundwhich again it is dependent onthe performance of the stock marketat that point in time.And third, just like any other investment,it comes with the risk of volatility.Since you would be investingin the stock market,or if you choose stock market,then it comes with the natural riskof investing in the stock marketwhich can be damaging,and if this money is protected moneyor retirement money or your whole lifeis dependent on this regular income,then I would advise you not to gofor the equity SWP plansbut the debt SWP plans, because yes,it does give you a lower rate of return,but at least it would bea predictable rate of return.I hope that through this you got to knowabout a new type of mutual fund,and you can then use it to generateregular income through your investments.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
