Check. One, two.Okay.Everyone, and welcome to the thirdand final part of the complete guideto studying abroad, powered byLeverage Edu, in the first two parts,which country to go to?which course to prepare?How do you go about preparing forthe examinations required for it?How do you go about applyingfor these universities and colleges?How do you go about preparingfor the interview process for thesethese five things we have covered.In today's episode, we'll coverhow to secure financial aid and finances?How do you process and apply or figure outthe visa process and finally,accommodation and preparing to leavefor your study destination.So let's get started.First of all, financial aid,very important becauseinternational education,tends to be extremely expensive.So if you already have the money,then, of course, you don't have to worryand you'll have to do thingsin a slightly different manner,but if you, like me, were relyingon financial aid.Then you will have to have a verydifferent approach towards thinkingof this entire money problemthat starts at the applicationprocess itself.So, if you haven't watchedthe second video,I would strongly encourage youto go through it.The application for financial aidgoes with the application process.And financial aids could beof very different types.It could be need based,could be merit based,could be accommodation, and so on.And it is possiblethat if the whole course if of $100,I wish it was.But, if the whole course is of $100,then you got maybe 30, 40,maybe 50% financial aid.That still means there is a gapto be covered.And how is that gap covered?That gap is covered, of course,through loans, through your own money,through your savings, your investments,so on and so forth.And the biggest thing that most people dois to actually go for loans.And the biggest thing that people dois to actually go for loans,these loans too, a lot of different banks,different interest rateand different terms and conditions.Understanding all of thatcould be quite complex.So I would strongly encourage you totake the help of a professionallike Leverage Edu, who will navigatethis entire thing for you.So that, you get a clarity that from whichbank could you get the best interest rate?From which bankwill you get the eligibility too?to get this kind of a loan amounthow soon it can be processed so on.And that financeis required for two things.First of all, of course,you have to payto the college and university.But, that usually is a small amount,only once you land thereor slightly before,you have to pay that semester fees.The bigger reason for the financial aidis the visa process.Because, visa is somethingwhich is highly dependenton your capability to fund your education.I still remember my visa day.When I went for my visa application.US ambassy, it's in Delhi, Chanakyapuri.And I went there with formal attire,full sleeves, shirt, pant and combed.And I was carrying,like this big file.I don't know what it was.Because we didn't haveany property as such. Didn't have money.Like in the bank, literally,there were a few 1000 rupees.So, there was nothing to show.But, I wanted to provethat I am a very intelligent student.I'll work hard after going there,so on and so forth.The biggest thing that I hadwas that I had 100% scholarship.I wasn't surewhether that was enough or not.So, I go, there's an American officerin the front.And he's like, where are you going?I'm going to Michigan State University.What are you going for?So I'm going for my PhD program. Okay.He was flipping and flipping.I am like what is he searching for?I can't see any money.And then he asked me that question.He's like, how are you goingto fund this education?And I said, I have 100% scholarship thatthe University has given me inthe form of a teaching assistantship.So, my tuition piece is waivedand I get a stipend of $1,500 per month.He looked at me,he said, that is incredible, my friend,and then he said, you have a good day.Everything's done.And that's why I knew I got my visa.That moment itself was when I knewthat I had my visa.And it was such an emotional momentbecause I knew that I would be leavingmy family for at least four or five years.But I also knew that I would be doingsomething that I always wanted to do.So, the process of VISA,that is so, so dependent onhow well can you prove that you havethat financial stabilityor that financial horsepower to fundyour education especially if you don'thave 100% scholarship.So whatever is the way,whether it's a loan,whether it's your own self fundingyou will have to show in that too.How much do you have in the bank account?How many assets do you have?How many fixed assets do you have?How many movable assets do you have?So on and so forth.How much is in the stocks,how much is in the gold, blah, blah, blah?And just be as elaborate as possiblefor you to showthat no matter how expensivethe education is, I can fund that.The reality is that most likelyyou will not need all of that money.because once you go thereand this is just me saying frommy experience, once you go there,at least tuition fees,I am pronouncing it like thisbecause they say it that way.They call it tution fees.They means, the US.A lot of people say tuition.So, the tuition fees,we need to pay the full tuition feesfor the first semester.We need to almost pay the second one too.But, if you start performing nicely.If you start getting good grades,then it's possible thatyou get some other financial aid,if you didn't get any.Or, it's possible that you getsome assistanceship.So it's very, very likely that if you workhard towards itand that's actually your aim,cost of that educationkeeps going down progressively.Plus the biggest thingis once you land there,most countries will allow you to workpart time, which is 20 hours a week.So, 20 hours a weekyou can technically by law work,for example, in the US,if you earn around $10 per hour,which is more or less what you can earn,again by giving private tuitions,working in the library,working at a store, store might be less.But you get the point.You can then make about $200or about $800 a monthand in $800 your living expenses,irrespective of...And in $800,your living expenses, depending on thecity that you live in.If you live in New York, then maybe...But, if you were in some mid-tier town,then, definitely, you can managethe expenses of your whole month.So it's very important,that you assess your cost of living,there's a cost of living calculatortoo by Leverage Edu that you can use,that in which city you are in,what are you going to study?And all of these factorsneed to be brought in mindthat how many years are you staying,which university is it,how expensive is it?is it student townor is it metropolitan town?Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.And all of this then comes ininto planning your finances,which, by the way, is something thatyou'll have to do right in the beginning,but this is where you arearranging for it.Visa then becomes the second process.For Visa, the more important thingthat embassies or countries care about.Because they don't carein which university did you get in.They are not even looking at that.They are looking at one thingand one thing at one point.Will this person come back?Or if he stays there,how much valuable that would be?And this is truly what they are trying toanswer, will this person come back?Or if he stays there,how much valuablewould he be for our country?And they are trying to measure that.This is foremost for students.Because they know that the easiest entryto any country and to eventuallyget the citizenship of their countryis by becoming a student.I have a lot of my friendswho went to the US,and they never came back.They are citizens there, they live there.And the country is also perhapshappy to have thembecause they have very bright kids.They are engineers or doctors or lawyersor accountants, bankers,whatever the case may be.And they're contributing to the economy.They're making good dollars,they're paying taxes, blah, blah, blah.And that's why the country is like,sure, yeah, why not?But if you have people who are going aslabor and they get to know,Warikoo is doing some randomcourse on shiro technology,he just has to drive a cab there, anyway.Or he just has to work in some restaurant,then it's very hard for peopleto have that visa come through or to getthrough that process in the first place.Unfortunately, there have beennumerous examples.Where these fake universities,take international people in bulk,get them in on a visa and then make theminto illegal immigrants,which doesn't work bothfor the person as well as the country.So this entire visa process also needs tounderstood very well,needs to be deciphered very well.Again, someone like at Levarage Eduwho's a professional on thiswill help you immensely.Because, if you go through them,then you have everything set in order.They will tell you exactly thedocuments you need, when do you need,why do you need them,in what situations do you need them?On which level would you want,for you to be prepared.Of course, you are the one who finallyhas to make that happen.But it is an important help that you canget from somebody like Leverage Edu.And then the final thingis you've got financial aid.All your financials have been sorted out,you've got your visa.Now you have to start preparingfor going to that destination.The biggest thing of thatis accommodation.Do you stay on campus?Do you stay off campus?If yes, where?And this is not an easy decision to make.Because a lot of it is dependent on thecost of living calculations you madewhich you're done at that end.And second,also considerations about how do thingschange from the experiences you wantfrom staying in that place.If you stay on-campus,naturally, your experience is goingto be dramatically different.Because, you will meet different peoplefrom different countries.You'll live with them,you'll eat with them.You'll play with them,you'll read with them.That will be such a different experiencefrom what you would getif you were to stay off campus.Because off campus, then you tend tostay with our nationality,our people, our world,our talks, and so on and so forth.It's, of course, usually cheaperto stay off campus, because you can shareaccommodation,2 to 3 people can stay in one room.On campus, typically, we can't get itbecause it's limited.Even if you get it,it tends to be expensive,along with the food and all.and there are several other factorsthat may dissuade youfrom staying on campus.So you have to figure all of that out.And depending on how far you are,from the actual process.you will have to then applyfor those accommodations wellin advance to ensurethat you get through andget a nice happy place to go.And then finally you haveto prepare for your departure.What I would strongly recommendis take as many clothes as you canpreparing for that.Except for very heavy woolensif you are going to a very cold place.Because the woolens used in India,they may not be applicablefor very cold icy areas.So if you're going to a cold icy area,like I was going,there the snowfall lasts for six months.So nothing that I could buy would help me.I had to buy a jacket from there anyway,but thankfully I tookthe overcoat from here.Which was a completelydifferent story altogether.But some other dayand you then prepare for it,It's better to takeas less food as possible.Because after going there,you'll again have to put your own setup.I would stronger encourage you tocook as much as you canas against eating out.It's healthier, it's cheaper,and you will get into the disciplinethat you would want to.And there's so many other things thatI can go on and on.But the broader thing isonce you have your financials in place,once you have your redesign in placethen just make sure that once you go thereyou're doing everything that you canto truly understand who you arebecause that is the best, bestoutcome of an international education.Who am I? What am I good at?What am I not good at?What are the things I should andshould not be doing in my life?And finding answers to these questionswill make your experiencecompletely differentfrom what anybody else's.Who is just going in for a degree,for a job, for just money.I hope this entire three serieswas helpful.Thank you, Leverage Edu for giving usall this information,for making me remember allthe happy moments that I hadwhile applying to the USas an Indian student applyingfor a PhD programand I hope that any questionsthat you may have will be answered.Again, use the help of professionalssuch as leveraging you to the maximumthat you canbecause they know how it's done.They have the understandingacross courses, across countries.They have the relationshipsto make it happenand you will only be able tobring the best of yourselfif you have such help.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
