Okay.Letâs get started.Yeah.Perfect.Alright.Thank you so much, Alok,for spending time with uson this video today.Itâs such a pleasure to have you.Thank you so much, Ankur.Itâs been a dream tocome to your show and to speak with you.I have followed you for a long timeand, you know, really it motivates mewhen I read about things that you do.Thank you so much.Thank you so much.I have to thank you becauseyour Weekend Investing smallcases have given me consistent,amazing and long-lasting returnsand I am really, really curious to understand thathow does that machinery work. So, in this video, Alok,an investment approach forindividuals is the thing that we will talk aboutand often whensomeone deciding or makingtheir investment approach,the first thing that they are asked is, âWhat is your risk profile? Are you risk averse? Do you take medium risks? Are you an aggressive risk taker?â And there are of course ways,like if we buy mutual fundsor something,we are asked some questionsand it is determined based on that.But as somebody who isfrom this industry,how do you suggestor recommend that people understand their risk profile?So, there is a regulatorycontrol dividing this question.In the sense thatthe regulator does not wantthat everyone does risk profiling. For example, we are risk,we are research analysts.So, we are not allowedto do risk profiling of the client.The financial advisorof that clientshould be doing the risk profiling.Then the financial advisorshould be suggesting that you allocate 20%to equity of whatever.Within equity, allocate 40%to direct stocks, 20% to mutual funds.So, the risk determining elementremains out of our scopefor the most part.But in general, I can say thatusually, you should be looking atrisk in terms of the volatilitythat you can handlein your,in your journey.You shouldtry to allocate towards various types of instrumentsto sort of go across the spectrum.So, you could be invested in mutual funds,you could be invested in smallcases,direct socks, ETFs,index investing,so on so forth.Within smallcases then,like for instance,in Weekend Investing, we havedifferent segments. Like you could go for large caps,you could go for small cap focused,you could go for very specialised nichestrategies like which arechasing all time highs,so on so forth.So, itâs very, very diversifiedand the larger picture isthat you should be looking at the riskand reward in tandemwhen you decidewhat you are going to look forbecause larger rewards arealways not goodand, you know,itâs intuitiveto go forstrategies which have high returns but that may not work the best for you.Thatâs what I think.Correct.Correct.I remember that in one ofmy very well received video, Alok, waswhen I explained to people about Alpha and Beta,and exactly what you said thatoften in life, we are just chasing the alpha,like to get the growthand to get the returns. But we forget the betabecause in order to get that return,the ups and downs that will happen,can you even have the heart to withstand it?And a lot of peopleare not able to do it.Like the moment an excuse appears, market downfall starts,people start selling everything out of fear.A really classicexample for this, Ankur, isPeter Lynchâs Magellan fund.For 12-13 years,Magellan Fund broke all the recordsand Peter Lynch was awardedthe best manager for those 12-13 years.It had around 24-25% CAGR,and the average investor in that fund made less than 10%.So, even ifyou are choosing the right vehicle but your behaviour,like when are you entering?Maybe at the top,youâre putting 500% more amount at the top,youâre withdrawing300% more at the bottom,youâre trying to time it,youâre trying to dobetter that the fund manager.So, the natural performanceof the vehicle,youâre not even able to beat it.So, ultimately, it all comes back to you as an individual, you as your,you know, your behaviourtowards your investing.All that matters. I think the result,and I very often say that strategies,like we have 10-12 strategiesbut it really does not matter that much,you know, from one strategy to the other. It is all dependent upon your behaviourand how you will execute it.Correct. Correct.And if you,I understand as a research firm, as a research analyst,there is only so muchthat you can sharebut if you have to give an informaladvice to someone around investing? Like the world has many strategies.Like there are many people like youwho are experts,who are qualified,they make amazing strategies but as you mentionedthat the fund is giving 24% returnsand the average investordidnât make even 10%. So, what is,what are those 2 or 3 things that an investor should take care ofwhen they think aboutinvesting their money?I think, first and foremost,there should be asset allocation on a large scaleand again, it will dependon the stage of life you are in. If you are young,you need not worry about asset allocation much. As you start approaching middle age, then asset allocation,allocation towards assetsother than equityneeds to be determined,and then I think,especially in India, we arefortunate that we are sitting in avery high growth economy.I mean, compared to a lot ofother investors globally, we have this heritage thatthe market will grow.At least for the next few decades, you are pretty much set.So, that kind of tailwindis a big plus in our investing, like if you are making small mistakes then they will correct over time.Correct.So, we just have to be disciplined in our investing,like if we have an SIP thenwe must be disciplined.We shouldnât try to do more anddisturb that flow.What is naturally going to happen, it must not be disturbed by us.So, I think that is the mainthing that we should be disciplined.Once you decide what to do,the way your allocation should bethen it shouldnât be disturbed.Absolutely.Absolutely.Youâre so right.According to me, this will be the most important takeaway thatwe are in a country,we are in an economywhere the next 2-3 decades are, like no one needs to know anything.Itâs a given thatnormal growth will happen. So, you donât need to do anything.Just keep investing.Keep investing regularlywhether the market is up or down.Over a long period of time,youâll be shocked and surprised to see the consistent returns.And this concept of returns,like if you assume an inflationof 6-8% over a long period,although it will be lesser than this. If you are beating inflation by 4-5%,even in index investing then you are doing great.I mean why wouldyou look at 20-25% returns and think that you are not doing good?If you are getting 11-12% and the inflation is 6-8%,you are doing great.Absolutely.Absolutely.Thatâs so true.Thatâs so true.Can I ask a personal question?What is your risk profile?How do you think about your money?Are you aggressive or a protector?I am very conservative.I am very conservativeand people think thathe makes everyone go for momentum investingand he is conservative himself but I want to destroy this myth.Momentum investing has nothing todo with aggressive investing.Momentum investing has a style which, I mean,has been there for decades in the world.We have recently been dealing with it, but itâs a beautiful style where things happen automatically. Itâs like an automated system.In fact, youâll be surprised toand your viewers will be surprised tosee that index is also a momentum fund.It is a momentum strategy where the winners are retainedand losers are removed.So, itâs a momentum strategy with a six-monthly balance.We usually do momentum strategywith a monthly or a weekly balance.Absolutely.Absolutely.Thatâs actually a very smart way ofthinking about it. I didnât see it like this before.Technically, Nifty 50 is a momentum.It is a momentum.In the top 50, your weight is changing.The ones not in the 50 are removed.The ones in the 50 are retained.If you look at the typeof stocks in the 50like Yes Bank was in Nifty,Jaypee Associate was in Nifty,Indiabulls was in Nifty.So, when they perform,we include them.When they donât perform,we exclude them.So, it is a momentum portfolio.Very nice. Very nice.And S&P 500being a momentum portfolio similarlyhad beaten 80% of fund managers globally.Fund managers.Exactly.Exactly.Which is so, so tellingthat however many strategies you put, there is a natural momentum inhow the index works itself.So, if a newcomer is therewho is scared,who doesnât know what to do and what not to do, if you try to tell themin the simplest languagewhat is momentum strategythen how would you describe that, Alok?The first thing is no one needs to be afraid in any market.Get rid of this thoughtthat you should fear the marketbecause market;fear will be thereif you are doing anything wrong in the market. If you have 100 rupees and you play for 300 rupeesthen you will have that fear.If you have 100 rupees, you put 10 rupees in the first year.Worst case scenario is that 10 rupees will go down to 5 rupees.Youâre still at 95and your 90 will make some money,even if it is in bank FD.So, you have nothing to losestarting off at any point. This is the first thing.Now, momentum investing is a different type of,a contrarian thought type of investing wherestocks arenot fundamentally viewed and analysed.In momentum investing,we have the BBC principle.BBC principle is<i>Bhav Bhagwan Che</i>So, BBC principle says that price is Godand in todayâs date,at the present moment, the price of a thing,whatever information you have about that stock,whether it is past performance,whether it is future potential, all that is reflected in it right nowand that is telling youwhat to do about thatparticular stock or index. Like for instance,you may have seenwhenever a company has good results,stocks had already risen. If the results are bad, the stock had already fallen.If there is a merger whichwill be profitable for the company, if it happens then the stock had already risen and we think that why is it rising,because the market is so porous. So, all this information seeps inand when the news comes,it is actually sell-on-news then.So, when we look at a companyâs3-monthly performance,it is actually the performance of thepast 3 months.It has nothing to dowith the future really.We extrapolate thatit will keep going at the same pace and we will get there.Anyhow, coming back.Sorry. Totally digressed.So, momentum investing is avery simple strategythatmomentum is a term in physicswhich means if a body is in motion, it will stay in motion until an external force acts on it,according to Newtonâs lawin physics. So, the assumption is if a stock is moving then you will assume that it will keep movinguntil a point where it doesnât.So, a stock in motion,upwards or downwards,will carry that momentum.This is an underlying thesis.If you try to createthat as a portfolio,then letâs say if youuse a simple criteriathat in the last 12 months,the stocks whose price rose the most.If based on that,we filter a universe of stocks. Letâs say CNX 200 is an index we chooseand we rank 200 stocksbased on the growth of stockscompared to last year.Some rose 100%,some rose 50%and some rose -50%and we select the toprankers from them,letâs say the top 20 stocks,and we invest in them equally, say 5% in each.Now, after 1 month or 1 week,whatever your rebalance period is,we will review this list again and checkwhether any of those 20 stocks dropped out or not,according to our new 12 monthpercentage return.If it drops out then we exit from it.The stocks that have replaced it,we will include it.So, what is happeningis an evolution,the evolution theory that says survival of the fittest.Like if the stock is surviving,it stays. If the stock is not performing, it goes out.And over time, if you continue it then you will see thatonly winners stay in your portfolio. So, the strength of that index or thatuniverse will remain in the portfolioand the weakness will automatically getremoved.So, in this way, you beat the benchmarks.Iâll tell you the example of Nifty.There are 50 stocks in Nifty.Now, all 50 are notperforming all the time.If there are 50 then maybe20 of them, at any point of time,will be doing better than the average,10-15 will be around the average and the rest will be below average.So, why donât we use momentum investing and focus only on its strengths?Suppose, ifYes Bank went from 400 to 20 rupees when it was falling.All this while when it was falling, it was still in the Nifty. It was removed from the Niftyonly when it reached 20 rupees.So, if you have selected Niftythen you have compulsorily bought Yes Bankand you are forced to participate in the 400-to-20 journey. So, if you segregate that index into a momentum portfolio then you donât have to invest into that weakness.So, in this way,like the simple example I gave of momentum investing,this is the way momentum portfoliosrun and there are many nuances ofmomentum investing but this was the, sort of, simplestway to understand it.This was,this is very useful. This was very usefuland you explained it well.With the example of Nifty 50, this was a really good point.So, tell me this, Alok, that momentum is like the fundamentalthesis for Weekend Investing?Do you base your;Yes;strategies on momentum only?Got it.And then how does it varyfor different risk profiles? Like for differenttemperaments, how does the same strategies take different forms?So, Iâll say that the geneticsacross the product are same.So, the basic genetics of the momentum, like we have 11 products. So, there aredifferentsegments that are being focused on those products.So, there are some products that are only large cap oriented. There are people who donâtwant to havesmall caps ormid caps in their portfolio.There are some products which are purely small cap orientedfor the ones who want higher risks,who can handle higher volatilitybut higher returns are there potentially. Then there are some mixed strategies, like there are large cap and mixed cap or mid cap and small cap.Some focused strategies are there which,like we have an all-time high strategyand it chases all time high stocks only.So, whenever the market is inhigh momentum, itâll do very well and at other times, itâll justsort of hang around here and there.So, there is a focused nuance like this in thereregardingchasing stocks. Then there are some strategies that are index oriented.So, like some people want totrade only in Nifty stocks.So, we have an âINDIA Top 10âstrategy which invests in best 10 stocks of Nifty only.There is one called âNNF10âwhich only investsin Nifty Next 50 index. So, these are the kind ofsmall but meaningfuldeviations from each other that exist.So, a lot of people actuallymake a bouquetto sort of diversify their risk also, like a group of large cap and a small capand an index chasing.They make a bouquet like this.Got it.Got it.And one thing that I often get to hear from my viewers around momentum isthat momentum is amazing when the market is rising up but when the market is falling down,it becomes equally harmful because it doesnât have winners to pick and winners are also losing.So, you suddenly start losing a lot.This,I donât actually knowwhether thatâs actually true or not.So, how would you react to this.I would say that this is also sort of a mythbecause people have made their mindsthat this is a momentum stock and this is a value stock.But itâs not true.All stockswill become momentum stocks and all stocks can become value stocks.The momentum and value investorsactually play a relay race.When the value islike when market is scraping the bottom.When you see thatthe cash price of the stock is higher that the cash price,when the value is visible then the value stocks and value investors are valued a lot.But even if you foundthe best possible value, how will you earn money?When it gains momentum.So, the value stocks,the value can identify stockswhen there is valueand then you hand over the baton tomomentum. Momentum then runs with itand when momentum starts failing then it gives back to the value, like now take the lead and stay quiet in the bear market.So, you will earn moneywhen there is momentum and in some way or the other, everybody is a momentum player because,people like us are chasing the price,value investors orfundamental investorschase earning,growth in earnings,growth in margins,growth in sales,growth in market shares. So, everybody is chasing some momentum in some way or the other.We are, of course, doing it moreon price focused manner.So, I mean,if we look at 200 years of US data,because they havedata studies of 200 years,the momentum factorhas beaten all other factorsby large margins.Wow.So, it is a no-brainer to say that momentum will beat all othertypes of investing.Got it.Probably,especially if they are done in a systematic manner. If you make an ad hoc portfolio and it performs wellthen that is a different thing.I heard you. I heard you. It was captured.Oh, this is very, very interesting.Okay. So, Alok, thenwhat are your suggestions?These are not again recommendations.Please donât take thisas financial advice.This is just Alokas an individual who runs a research advisory firmand has,in my opinion,smallcases which have performed really well for mebut none of this is financial advice.So, donât take this as financial advice.If somebody, Alok, is wanting to startwith momentum through smallcase,what would be recommendation to them and why? So, the ones who have just started.Momentum, smallcaseor in momentum strategy,they gave not invested.So, Ankur, what can be done iscome to the simplestmomentum strategy.We have a free strategywhich invests only in ETFs.So, gold ETF and Index Nifty ETFare the ones that it invests in and it invests in equal proportions and you just have todo a monthly rebalance where itagain rebalances to 50.Just to get a flavour ofwhat is momentum investing and smallcase investing for a very sort of newcomer, and surprisingly becauseI have actually,I have beenpromoting a hedge of goldin many of our strategies alsoas well as in general. So, I believe thatgold is highly under ownedas an asset classand if you compareits performance with Niftythen in all periodswhere Nifty is not doing well,gold and INR will do very well.So, if you look at acombination of both, if a product contains boththen itâll easily beat the bankand give you a very, you know, low risk sort of returns.So, it is a complete no-brainerto start and try that product just get or make your first entry orwet your feet.Perfect.Perfect.Then there are simple strategies like INDIA Top 10, NNF10 which are monthly rebalanced. It has no weekly activity.In most other strategies, you need to give 2 minutes a week.In this, you need togive 2 minutes a month.So, this is like theMaggi of the financial world.2 minutes and youâre done.Awesome.And then after that,what will be the top grade?Like someone who really wants toexplore momentum,get the benefits of it over a long period of time.Benefits will be there in everything but the higher risk oneswill be the ones which are, letâs say chasing all time highs or like the all time high strategy or the all time high 2x strategyor if you have a strategy in small capsof sorts then it has a higher riskthan the other onesbut other than that I thinkany of those strategieswill do quite well.Just one second, Alok.And then, one final question that I had,not final but 2 final questions is:Most of these smallcases are priced.So, for an investor, how should they think aboutthis price as theyOkay.Next, Alok.Most of these smallcasesare priced.So, how does an investor think about this price? How do, after embedding it in return,like what should be the minimumquantum thatthey should invest in a year so that they can safely recover the cost of the smallcase and not treat it like a big expense?So, this is a good question.I feel thata lot of people are still lookingat smallcases as a short term solution.Like you said that how torecover the cost in one year? So, I think most strategiesavailable for smallcases, I canât speak for other managers but the strategies that we have, they are long term oriented.So, 3-5 year type orientationmust be there becausein equity markets, you can never saywhen you are at the top of the cycle and when the cycle may turn down.So, for 1-3 years,you shouldnât do thiswith this kind of thought processand all our strategieshave a recommended,in their descriptions, there is a recommended capital range.Most of thesestrategies will have like3 lakhs, 5 lakhs,2 lakhs,they have a minimum value like this.Based on that,you can calculate that,suppose a strategy is for 7,000 rupeesand if youput 7 lakh rupees then 1% will be the expense ratio.So, you have to try thatif you have a 2-4 year runwayand if you start from the minimumthen in 2-4 years,where will you get to,think of an average of thatand based on that,you can calculate your yearly expense ratio because ofthe cost of the subscription.Got it, got it, which makes a lot of sense.Andfinally, Alok,what are the 2 or 3 risk/thingssomeone should bear in mind when theysubscribe forWeekend Investingâs smallcases?The risk that is associatedwith equity markets, that is the only risk that I would consider.The volatility equity markets haveand equity as an investment class has a volatility, we try that, letâs say if Nifty falls by 40% in a year, like in the Covid year or in 2008, then in our strategy, it falls less.You deal with less drawdown.For drawdown, I would like to say this that drawdown scares people a lot and drawdown has a fundamental principle that the lesser drawdown you have;Drawdown is, let me also explain drawdown. Drawdown is basicallyhow much your portfolio has fallen fromits maximum point to the lowest point.So, that is the drawdown figure. So, letâs say if you started from 100 rupees and your returns were 40% then you are at 140%.From there,letâs say you have a 10% drawdown. So, you are at 126%.And then again,letâs say you got a 40%.So, youâll go to 170,something like that.But letâs say, if the drawdown was 50% or 40% instead of 10%then you would havecome down to maybe like, 80 oror something like thatand the next would havetaken you to 120-130.So, the component of drawdown, if you can minimize itthen your next jumptakes you way higher.Correct.So, the analogy it has thatif you are runningand you fall in a pitand if the pit is 3 feet deepthen youâll get up, you'll brush off your clothesand youâll start running again, but if the pit is 13 feet deepthen getting out will be a problem.So, drawdown needs to be minimizedand all our strategies have this effortto minimize the drawdown. So, outperform,when the market is performing,you try to perform the sameor overperform a littleand when the market is falling,try to outperform even then.So, there is outperformance on upside and outperformance on downside.Both together willcreate that magic actually.Right.That is a very important point.So, this is the riskwe try to mitigate,and the risk of equityas an investment classwill be therebut we can mitigate it bycoming into such strategies,by diversifying across such strategies and of course, on a larger basis,your financial advisor should alsomake you allocateinto various asset classes to, you know, sort of,hedge against various things.Exactly.Awesome.Wonderful.Thank you so much, Alok.It was really amazing.Firstly, thank you for all thehard work that youâve put in.It is not trivial.It looks likejust crunch the numbersand things happen but there is so much that goes behindthat we got to knowtoday in this video,and thank you for all the smallcases that you have put out.I am a fanboy and a loyal customer.So, thank you for all the returns thatyou have generated for the capital that I have deployed and I wish you the best.Thank you so much, Ankur, and likewise, fanboy moment as well and I really look forward to all your content and, you know,get motivated to do moreand I wish all your viewersand all your subscribersa great journey in theirinvestment journeys ahead.Thank you so much.All the best, Alok.Thank you.Bye.Bye.
