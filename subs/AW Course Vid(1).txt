I love this story,not because it's my story,but because it's a lesson I wantto share with all of you,that it's easy to tell yourselfthat you should settle in your 20s,but it is very important to understandthat the decade of 20sis not for settling down,the decade of 20s is for knowingwhat you are good atand what makes you happy,what you are good atand what makes you happy,because if you have found thisin 10 years that what are you good atand what makes you happy,then you can spend your entire 30sdoing those things,and that's why you will goa long way in life,because you are doing what genuinelymakes you happy and you are good at it.How many of you are stuck?!You have not even started your life,and you are already stuck.You are in a job where you are earninga salary, earning money,but you are not happy in it.Money is important!Ask me, ask yourself,because we all know money is important,But to what extent?What are you prepared to do for money?How far can you go to earn this money?To beautifully illustrated this concept,I want to share the concept of ikigaiwith you all.Ikigai is a Japanese word,it doesn't have a direct translation inEnglish, but if you loosely translate it,then its meaning in English is,purpose of life.What is the meaning of your life?What is the purpose of your life?What is the objective of your life?There is a beautiful visual illustrationto understand this, and it has 4 circles.The first circle denoteseverything you're good at,and the second circle denoteseverything you enjoy doing,then the third circle denoteseverything the world needs,something the world needs,and finally the fourth circleis something that you can make money with,and ikigai is the intersection of all 4,the thing that you're good at,the thing that makes you happy,the thing the world needs,and the thing you can make money withis your ikigai, your life's purpose,and I believe that the decade of 20sshould be spent in finding your ikigai.If you spend the decade ofyour 20s finding your ikigai,then you will find somethingwhich very few people in the worldare able to find.And another interesting thingis its intersections.If there is something that you are good atand you are happy doing it,then that's your passion.Your passion is everything you are goodand you are happy doing it.It's not necessary that the worldneeds it.It's not necessary thatyou can make money through it.You want to sing, and you are good at it,you are happy doing it,and you are at peace whenever you sing.But it is not necessary thatthe world need your singing.And even that's not necessary thatsinging can make money for you.I believe it can be possible,I have created a special course,specifically for this very thing, which isMaking Money Through Your Hobby.It's a very powerful course in whichI teach that if you have a hobby,if you have a passion,then how can you make ita money-making asset,but that is an entirely different course.You can go to the descriptionand click on it,and get to know more about it.But something you are good atand you find joy in doing,that thing is your passion.Something that you enjoy doingand the world needs it,it is not necessary thatyou are good at it,and it is not necessarythat you get paid for doing it,that thing is your mission.Something that the world needsand you can make money from itis your vocation.And finally, what you are good at,and you get paid for doing it,that thing is your profession.It is not necessary that you are happydoing that thing,and it is also not necessary thatthe world needs that thing,you are good at it,and you get paid for it,and this is our reality.Spend your 20s in discovering your ikigai.Spend these 10 years in such a way thatyou find out what you are good at,what makes you happy,what fulfills the need of the world,and that's how you can also earn money.Whenever I share all this,a common remark comes up thatit is not practical.You have given a very good frameworkand explained about ikigai,but it does not work practically in life.It is not so easy that you willlook for it and get it.I know what you're saying isfrom the right point,and I'll share a framework with youto clear things up and give yousome practical advice.This framework is what I used in my lifewhen I was at such a stage whereI had a job, did not have a job,when and what.To understand this framework,let's make a two-by-two matrix.Two by two matrices are very powerfulbecause they simplify very complex things.So I will take a 2 by 2 Matrixand there are four sections in it.On the x-axis, I will ask you,Do you have a job or not?No, yes.And on the y-axis, I will ask youa very interesting question which is,do you need the job or not?Let's see how it works.The first thing is the most common one,you have a job and you need that job.A lot of people will be in this quadrant.You have a job and you need a job.This means that whatever your salary is,it is necessary for you,to pay your bills,support your family,and for your own expenses,you spend your salary on that.If you are in this quadrant,then your mindset cannot be equalor similar to that mindsetwhen you do not have a job.Obviously, your approach will be differentin each quadrant.The way you live your life in each sectionwill be different.And all these four sections haveonly one purpose, that is,can you reach the quadrantwhere you don't have a job,but you don't need a job either?Can we all get into the quadrantwhere we don't have a job,but we also don't need a job?We don't have a job,but we don't even need a job.With our experience, with our knowledge,with our skills,we have created so many assetswhich are earning money for useven when we are sleeping.We all want to reach that pointwhere we don't need a joband we don't even have a job.So if we want to get into this quadrant,this focused section,there are different directionsto get there.First of all, if we have a joband we need that job.If you are in this section,then your approach to life should be thatof an investor.You will spend your life like an investor.What does this mean?This means that when you getyour monthly salary,you use it to pay your bills,support your family,and take care of your basic needs,and after that, whatever money is left,you invest it.You don't waste it,you don't use it to buy a phone,you don't use it to take a loanto buy a car or a house or a bike,you just invest it.You almost live like a poorwhere you tell yourself thatmy only aim is to fulfill my basic needs,and invest every remaining single penny.My aim is to come from this sectionto this section.My aim is to move from a positionwhere I have a joband I need a jobto a position where I have a jobbut I no longer need that job.If you are in a sectionwhere you have a jobbut you no longer need that job,at this point your approach would be ofa hunter.You will take the approach of a hunter.You will hunt!For what?For opportunities.I will not try to becomethe employee of the month,employee of the quarter,or employee of the year.What is my purpose?Not to stay in this job.My aim is to go to a positionwhere I do not have a joband I do not need that job.So what will I do?Whatever work I am given,I will do that work with full dedication,but as soon as I finish that work,I will spend my time on myself,and I will become a hunter.Tell yourself thatI just have to value my time,and I have to use this time to createthe next set of opportunities.And if you do that right,you move to the next quadrant.The quadrant where you don't needyour job anymore,you can turn down that job,quit that job, now you can spendyour time on all the things you wantedto do for yourself, every single thing,every single opportunity thatyou created for yourself.You neither need this jobnor are you in this job now.In this quadrant, at this point,you take on the character of an explorer.Now you explore.What is the difference betweena hunter and an explorer?A hunter knows what they arerunning after, what thay are hunting,and they remain focused on the same thing.An explorer doesn't even knowwhat they are looking for.They can appreciate anythingin the whole open sky.He says that I have reachedsuch a point wherewhatever new thing comes,I will look at it with the same curiosity,with the same excitementas if it were any other thing,and that is the most valuable stageof our life.You are in a zone,you are at a stage in lifewhere you want to explore.You ask yourself,I don't know what could be the new thingthat would make me happy,the one thing I'm good at,the one thing the world needs,the one thing I can make money with,but I have reached a pointwhere I don't have to worry about money,value my time,and if I can do anything new,So I will explore.We wish for this momentevery single moment,throughout our life we ââtry to reachthis point,and we will be able to reach this pointonly when we know in our mindwhat is the way to reach there.Final quadrant, difficult quadrant,super tough quadrant.A section where you need a jobbut you don't have a job,and at this point, you have no choice,you can adopt only one form,and that is a warrior.At this point, you have to tryevery single idea, every single strategythat you can deployto reach this objective,you simply have to survive.Nothing else is important at that point.If you try anything elsewhich is not towards survival,it's just a distraction.If in your 20's,you try to know this framework,when we start, none of us have a jobbut we need a job,we all behave like a warrior,and that is step one.And if we do this task properlyand only focus on survival,then we reach a point wherewe have that job and we need that job too.And at that point,we behave like an investor, step two.In this form we find ourselves to be poor.We tell ourselves,I don't have much.Whatever I get,I have to use it to support my family,support my basic needs,but whatever is leftand I definitely have to save,I will invest whatever is left.I will deploy it efficientlyand I will ensure that my excess moneybrings me to the stage whereI can behave like a hunter.That stage would be where you have a jobbut you don't need that job.You have a bufferwhere you can survive for 1-2 yearswithout a job.And at that point, behave like a hunter.At that point, you will huntfor new opportunities, smart people,projects, for somethingthat you always wanted to do,for your hobbies.Everything that helps you to reach a pointwhere you can finally leave your joband go to stage 4.And that stage would be of an explorer.That stage where you no longer needa job and that's why you aren't in a job.At this stage, you will be earningwhile sleeping.At this stage, you will work but onlybecause you want to explore,you want to find new things,and you want to knowhow you can do something new and differentin your life.And when you reach that stage,you will truly be able to enjoy your life.At this point, you will realizethat you can do anything in life.We all want to reach this stage!We all want to reach this stagewhere we do not have a jobbut we don't need that job as well.When you try to spend your 20slike this, many people will laugh at you,many people will discourage you,and the first ones would be your parentsbecause they will call you stupid.They will say, you wanted to finishyour studies quickly, get a job,settle down, buy a car, have children,and absorb yourself in that life.And they are not wrong becausethat's how they have lived.When our parents were growing up,when they were in their 20s,they did not have the optionsthat we have.They only had to survive.They knew that if they did not workin that month, they did not earn anything,then they might not even haveanything to eat.They did not have the luxury to invest,to earn anything excess,but now the world has changed,and they are not as familiarwith the world as you are.You are born in this world,they are adapting to this world.They can't even believe thatso many opportunities are available for usthat they didn't have.Engineer, doctor, lawyer,there were not many options beyond this.So, if they do not understand you,that's their nature,and according to them, they are right.But you will have to choose a pathfor yourself because the biggest thing,my friends, is that this world tells usevery daywhat should we do or not.The world reminds us every daywhat is success and what is a failure.The world tells us every day thatif we don't get that many marks in collegethen we are a failure,if we don't get a job in this companythen we are a failure,if we don't get that much salarythen we are a failure,if we don't get married by this timethen we are a failure,if we don't have a car by this timethen we are a failure,if we don't get so much promotionthen we are a failure,we will be told on everything thatthis is a success and this is a failure,this is right and this is wrong.We will accept it becausewe have never stopped and asked ourselveswhat is success for me,and what is a failure for me.So the best, the greatest giftyou can give yourself is to defineyour own success and failure.Without listening to the world,even without listening to your parents,you will decide your success and failurefor yourself.Because if you do not do thatthen the world will not leavea single chance to tell you thatyou are a failure.You are in your 20s, 21, 22, 23, 24,maybe 26, 27, 28, you are confused,you feel that you are the only onewho is not sorted,everyone around you is so clear,they know what to do in life,they are doing whateverthey want to do in life,only you are not able to do it,you are incapable, you are inadequate,only you are not able to do it,there is something lacking in you,and if you are feeling all this,if you feel that you are notin the right direction,then I can assure you that everythingwill be alright.If you adopt your definition offailure and success with a true heart,without listening to this world'sdefinition of success and failure,then everything will be fine.But for this,you have to listen to yourself.If you'll define your success and failurefor yourself, chase what you are good at,what makes you happy,and spend your entire 20snot in settling but in exploring,then take it in writing from me,everything will be alright!
