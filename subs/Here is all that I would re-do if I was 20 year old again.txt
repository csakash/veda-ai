Career, relationships,and personal finance,Career, relationships,and personal finance, in these 3 sections,10 tips eachthat I would want toteach my 20-year-old self so that he knowshow to live lifeand what is goingto happen with him in life.Career number 1: âDon't settle.Every person, Ankur,would tell you to settle in your 20s.Finish your studies quickly and settle.Get married quickly and settle.Get a job quicklyand settle.Buy a house quicklyand settle. But the world has changedand it is my desire, Ankur,that you know, at the age of 20, that the world is just beginning,and the next 10 years of your lifeare going to be themost beautiful years if you explore,if you set out in new directions and experience new things,make in new friends, work in new countries, work in new cities,work in different jobs,pursue various internships,pursue variousfreelance opportunities,do various projects,complete many coursesso that you get to know what you are good at,what really makes you happy.âCareer number 2:âNever ever, Ankur,stop learning.The world will tell you thatwhen your studies are over,when you are college is over,then learning also stops. Now, it is the time to earn.Who would learn now?Only doctors and lawyers arenot supposed to learn for life.Every single person needs tolearn throughout their life.The world is changing so fast that one,just one skillwill take you forward, and it is that anytime, at any point, you can become a student again.Career number 3:âDo not underestimate your network.It would feel like that these people won't benefit you.They will be unableto do anything.Why should you befriends with them?But we don't knowwho would becomewhat in the future. Your network isyour opportunity creator.What your friends endup doing in the future,that will determine whatopportunities you will get becauseyour school friends,your college friends,your office friendswill create youropportunities in the future.If just one phone callis what they need toconnect with Ankur againand tell him abouta new opportunity,then you have usedyour network properly.But do not make this networkfor your selfish reasons.Try to actually know people,try to understand them.Ask them where they are from,what circumstancesdid they grow up in, who is in their family,what is theirperspective towards life?The more curiosityyou show in people,the more they will love youand they will feelthat you reallywant to know themand donât want to askthem for something.âCareer number 4:âDon't be afraid to lose,because every person will lose.You will also lose.You will lose a lot.You will make many mistakes,but if you do not takethe first step, Ankur, so that you never lose, then you will stay where you are. Everyone will move forward. Do not be afraid of losingbecause beyond your fearslies your victory.That ad is not hollow.It is a lesson for life.The more comfortable youmake yourself with fear,the more new risks youwill be able to take,the more you will makeyourself understand,âWhat am I afraid of?Why am I afraid?This fear was so small.âWhen that thing is over,when you will achievevictory over it,you will feel how small, insignificant that fear wasand you are so muchbigger than it.âCareer number 5:âThe things in your mind are extremely beautifulbut as long as the worlddoes not know them, they are of no use. Learn to communicate, my friend. Learn to speak. Learn to use your body.Your face, your hand, learn how to use them.Get to know that your speech is extremely powerful.The way it speaks to people,the perspective withwhich it treats them,that creates an impactand it might become thebiggest differentiatorof your life,because ideas arein everyone's mindsbut if you know how tocommunicate that idea, Ankur, then you will win.You will win your entire life.âCareer number 6:âBe adaptable.Everything will not goaccording to your wish.It's not necessary that the worldwill work according to you. It goes where ever you want.Things happenaccording to your wish.The type of peopleyou want to work with, you get them.No.There will be situations in lifewhere you would not have a choicebut your test would bethat even in that situation, can you deliver or not?In your career,the more adaptable you become,the more you will move forward,because the entire decade of 20s is just for this.Remember the first one? You must explore, my friend.You should not settle. You should not stop anywhere.You should keep moving forward. And it will only happen when you will be adaptable, when you will be moldable, when you will be flexible, when you can turn in any direction because you are not attached to any direction.â And it will only happen when you will be adaptable,when you will be moldable,when you will be flexible,when you can turn in any direction because you are not attached to any direction.âCareer number 7:âA lot of people will tell you, âRun after salary.Run after money.YOLO.You get life only once.You get youth only once.âAnd they are right. They are not wrong.When this youth will be gone,it might be sad,you will also be sad,but it does not mean thatyou should stop chasingmeaningful work.The work that you enjoy, Ankur,the work doing which genuinelymakes you feel at peace,that work is the most beautiful.It will teach you the most.Through it, your most beautifulrelationships will be formed,and if you get that forslightly lesser money,then it is better.Do not ignore it.Don't ignore amazing work,meaningful work ever in your life. Don't run away from it.âCareer number 8:âPeople might give youfeedback or they might not.You must always be ready to receive feedback.In fact, you haveto ask for feedbackbecause the more you are afraid of, âWhat people would say? I should not say anything wrong. I shouldn't get hurt.â,the more you will beunable to improve yourself. Think about it.If you ask someone for feedbackand they give you genuine feedback and you are able to work on it,you win, Ankur. You move forward.And that is the bestthing about feedback.You are being told to improve it.And if you do not agree with it, ignore it, but don't stop asking for it.Always keep askingfor feedback.âCareer number 9: âIn your 20s, you would feel that in your 24 hours,working for 18, 20, 22 hours in a hustle mode is good because your body supports it, your mind supports it,your hands support it, but sometimes,you should stop.Taking breaks is not bad. Going on vacations is not bad. Spending time with your family is not bad.Having fun with your friends is not bad.Give yourself that enjoyment where you are working, and you are doing good work,but you are also enjoying, and you are enjoying well too.âCareer number 10:âIrrespective of what happens,irrespective ofanything that happens, your integrity,your morals, your values,they should never be dishonored.No one should judgeyou for the ideathat may be this person, by nature,is not a good person,because then, however hard you work,however many hours you put in, however rich you become,you will never beable to move forward. Keep your intentions always true.Do not ever backstab people.Whatever you want to tell them,say it directly to them,and do not engage in any gossip. You must keep your heart, your workand your nature clean.âRelationship number 1:âWhenever any relationshipgets difficult,whether it's romantic,or with your parents,or with your siblings or friends, communication is the key. Relationships break, my friend,because we stop talking. Don't ever stop talking.Always keep your ego lesserthan your communication, and you should keep talking.âRelationship number 2:âWhen you turn 20, Ankur, there won't be any social media,but when you turn 25, social media would be there, and you would then have 400, 500, 600 friends. Never prioritize quantity over quality.Never feel proud aboutthat on Facebook,on Instagram, on anyother social media platform,you have a lot of friends.Friends are based on quality.Relationships mustbe based on quality.So, even if they are less,they must be such that they understand you,they listen to you,and they give you honest advice.âRelationship number 3:âBoundaries, Ankur,are extremely important.Being able to tell a person thatwhat is right for you,what is wrong for you, and where they should stop is very important.Being able to ask that personwhat are their boundaries  is also important.The more you respectthese boundaries, Ankur,the more space you will give to the relationship to grow,to become strong.âRelationship number 4:âStay authentic, Ankur.Never take anyone else's form.Don't try to be someone else.As long as you are yourself,people will likeyou for who you are.And this is the wayto make friends.The person you are,be that person,and then see whois impressed by youbecause they areyour true friends,they are yourtrue relationships.âRelationship number 5: âListen to people.Become the bestlistener for them.If you have the abilityto listen, Ankur,then people willtell you everythingand they will confide in you, they will trust you,they will believe in you.And if you, without judgement, listen to them,not because you want to answerbut because you genuinelywant to understand them,then you will becometheir closest friend.âRelationship number 6: âPeople will make mistakes.You will also make mistakes. Learn to forgive. Learn to forgive people.People cannot beright all the time.Your parents willnot always be right.Your siblings willnot always be right.Your friends won'talways be right.Your partner won'talways be right.You won't alwaysbe right as well.As much as you wantpeople to forgive you,you will also have to givethem the chance to be forgiven.You will have to learn it.âRelationship number 7:âThere will come a pointwhere you would feel,âIs this relationshipnot moving forward?Is it not becoming strong?âBut I can tell you one thingat the age of 42that relationships take time.Relationships take time to become strong.Give them that time.Give them that value that they want to becomethat meaningful relationshipin your life.âRelationship number 8:âRespect the differences.Everyone cannot think like you. Everyone cannot be like you.It does not meanthat they hate you.It also doesn't mean thatthey are different from you or they are wrong.They are justlooking at the samething witha different perspective, and it is perfectly fine. In fact, it is a sign of maturity that with another person,even with their different nature,you can still form arelationship with them because you know that anyone's perspectiveis not right or wrong.It's just different.âRelationship number 9: âBe supportive.You do not have to solveeveryone's problem.It is not your responsibilityto fix everyone's lives,but it is your responsibility that you give them support.You stay with them.Whenever they ask you for help,you help them,but don't try to fix their life.As long as they don't ask,don't try to be their god, their savior.Have a relationshipas it is meant to be. Don't try to become their life.âRelationship advice number 10: Maybe the most important advice.âNo matter whathappens, my friend,the relationship with yourself, don't forget it.The more time you are able tospend with yourself, Ankur,the more you will beable to form a good,beautiful, strong relationship with others.Living with yourselfis extremely difficult.A lot of people cannotspend just 5 minutes a daywith themselves,with their thoughts.Every day,some moments,some time,if you are able tospend with yourself.Your abilities,your weaknesses, your strengths, even after considering everything, if you can accept yourself,then you have a beautifulrelationship with yourself. Don't forget yourself.âFinance number 1: âStart saving from childhood.A lot of people will give you money on birthdays,on Raksha Bandhan,or in any other way,on any festival, or in any situation,all that money,of course, spend some of itbut a habit of saving,and then how to use that money, that habit, develop it from a young age.âFinance number 2:âLearning what investing is.How you can use yourmoney for yourself,learning that is importantbecause if you work ina job your entire life,and try to become richthrough its salary,it may happen or may not. But the money you earn, if you put it to work,then that moneywill work for you.âFinance number 3:âIt will all be possible if you can create a budget.A budget will be an importantapproach in life, Ankur,because you don't wantto save all yourmoney for old agewhen you won't haveany teeth left,you won't be able to walk,and you would be rich then.No. What is thepoint of such money? But it shouldnât be thatyou spend all yourmoney right nowand you don't saveanything for the future. Some amount for needs,some amount for desires,and some amount for the future. If you create a budget, then in life,in a disciplined manner,you will be able tolook at your money.âFinance number 4: âGod forbid, if anything happens,then it shouldn't happenthat you have no money.You need to askpeople for money.Always have an emergency fund.Whatever yourmonthly expenses are, at least 6 times of it, and ideally 12 times of it,always have it in your bank or in a fixed depositso that if anytime,at any moment, for any need, you need money,you should always havemoney for 12 months,or at least 6 monthsof expenses.âFinance number 5: âIt will be really beautiful,and you will reallyenjoy thinking thatwith your credit card,you can buy shoes, you can buy a phone,you can buy cars on loan,you can do anythingbecause people and bank are ready to give you a loan.But this loan,as far away as you can,try to run away from it.Instead, I would say if you hadto take 2 loans in life, then take these 2 loans. First, to buy a house,and second, for your education. Every other expense,whether it's a phone or a car or anything else,spend your own money.Spend after saving.And if you don't have money,then don't spend,because the more you runafter this status, Ankur,the more you willdrown in debt.âFinance number 6: âTaxes, my friend,is a very big reality.You cannot run away from it. You can only understand it. Try to understand taxes.Government providesa lot of schemes,a lot of opportunitieswhere you canreduce your tax. But for that, you have to understandwhere you can reduce it, how you can reduce it,and how alongwith staying withinthe boundariesof the laws,along with becominga good citizen,you can effectivelymanage your taxes. You will have to learn it.This is not the CAs job.It's your job.âFinance number 7:âPlan for yourretirement, my friend,because there willcome a time whenthe salary that you are earning,you won't be able to earn it.But you would still have a life.Your own life, maybe your partnerâs life, maybe even your children's life, and at that time,your money,how will it be useful, will you even have it or not, that depends on you. It is your choice.You need to planfor it yourself.âFinance number 8: âYour investments, Ankur, diversify them.It shouldn't be thatyou love something, or something is doing well, so you put all your money in itbecause one thing, if God forbid, takes a downfall,goes into a loss, or is changed,then your entire investmentwould be gone.That's whyas much as you can diversify,do it. Don't diversify too much. Don't diversify too much.Invest some amountin stock market,have some fixed deposits,put some money in PF,put some money in corporate bonds, put some money in real estate,buy some gold,invest in crypto if you havethe understanding and interest,but make sure that this risk profile,you understand that properly,and you have diversifiedthis money well so thatif one of these takes a downfall, then the rest are still in good condition.âFinance number 9:âSpend your money wisely. Don't spend recklessly.Don't spend just so you canshow people how rich you are.Don't spend just becauseyou do not value money.Spend wiselybecause you have earned thismoney through your hard work, and it does not meanthat you waste it.âAnd finally, finance number 10: âJust like in your career,you continued to be a student,similarly, even for money,keep educating yourself. New things will happen.One day, crypto will be launched.The next day, somethingelse will happen. All these things are new for you.At the age of 20, you don'teven know what is crypto? How do you invest in stock market? But all these things,you will have to learn them, understand them.And if you understand them,then you will also have toinvest in money in them. But only one thing will make it possible,that you must be ready to learn.ââThese 30 tips, Ankur,at the age of 20,if you learn them,understand them,apply them in your life,then I guarantee it to you that in the future,you will live a beautiful life.You will make mistakes.You will definitely make mistakes,but you will be able tolearn from those mistakes,you will be able to recoverfrom those mistakes.These learnings,I want you to teachthem to your children, and in the future,if any other person is willingto listen to your voice,they should also learn them.âAnkur Warikoo, signing off.
