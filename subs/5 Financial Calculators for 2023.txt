In 2023,In 2023,through these5 financial calculators,keep yourselffinancially smart.Number 1. Lumpsum calculator. It will tell you, in simple language,that if youmake a lumpsum investment then over a period of time,what will be its growth?For example.If we look at this calculator. It is on Groww.This is not a sponsored video. I am using this calculator so that you can access it easily.And I would say that1 lakh rupees of lumpsum investment is our goal.We feel that this investmentâs returnswould be nearly 12% which is quite expected in the stock market.And we willinvest it for 10 years.So, other than this 1 lakh,you will earn 2,10,000 rupees which meansafter 10 years, this 1 lakhwould have become3,10,000 rupees.Now the interesting thing is that how these years give you way more money. These 10 years, if replaced by 20, then see this. That money increased by 3 times.You doubled the time but the moneyincreased by 3 times.Now, itâs 9,64,000. If the 20 years are replaced by 30 then âha, ha, ha!â It has tripled itself.So, your moneyIf your timeline is 30 years, then your money has increased by 10 times.Your time increased by 3 times,from 10 years to 30 years,but the 3 lakh rupeesthat you wouldget after 3 yearshave now become29 lakh rupees.Almost 10 timesof the original 10-year investment.Almost 10 times of the original10-year investment.Thatâs why itâs saidthat whenever youmake an investment,the longer you do it for, the more,at the same rate of return,your money will grow.And thatâs why, I also saywhatever investmentsyou make in life,please look at them in theform of long-term investments.Not that within 2 years,becoming rich overnight.This is financial calculatornumber 1 for 2023.Now every person is not capable or does not have money or regular flow of moneythat they can makelumpsum payment.Most of us canonly make an SIP. SIP meansSystematic Investment Plan. Meaning every month,you will makea regular investment,almost in the form EMI.That investmentwould be a bank deductionand would go toyour investments. The difference is,not to the bankbut to yourself,Andit is important for you to calculatethat the SIPif done for a long period then how much moneywill it make?Letâs gointo the SIP calculator. Same. It is on Groww.And letâs say that monthly,you invest 5,000 rupees.That means yearly,you invest 60,000 rupees.Weâll go with 12%which is reasonableon the stock marketand we willstart with 10 years.So.10.If you doan SIP for 10 years, then over 10 years,6 lakh rupeeswould be invested in this SIP. And over and above,this 6 lakh rupees,you will get 5,60,000 rupees. Meaning total,after 10 years,those 6 lakhswould increaseto nearly 11,60,000 rupees. Double.But if instead of 10, if itâs 20 years,Wow!!Look at that.Those 12 lakh rupees are now 50 lakh rupees.You invested 12 lakh rupeeswhich wereYour 12-lakh investment, for a 20-year SIP, is now worth 50 lakhsat the end of 20 years. If you do this for 30 years,then you will invest18 lakh rupees but on those 18 lakhs,you will earn1,60,00,000 rupees.Which meansafter 30 years, your 18 lakh rupeeswould be nearly1,75,00,000 rupees.This is insane! This is crazy!But it is very importantthat this discipline is therewhen you are investing. And yes.People watchingthis video will say,âAnkur. This is easy.After 30 years,what value will1,75,00,000 rupees hold?âAbsolutely right.Which is whythird financial calculator.Inflation Cost Value.That due to inflation,something that costs100 rupees todaywill cost what after X years? Or in other words,what will be the value of your money?Letâs use the same example.You, for 30 years, do an SIP of 5,000 rupees. You earn 12% interest.And after 30 years,you get1,75,00,000 lakh rupees.And now letâs see through the third financial calculator the value of 1,75,00,000after 30 years, how much will it be? And for that,we use the inflation calculator. So, letâs do that.We enter1 crore 75 lakh. And weconsider 6% inflation.And we check for 30 years.And when we do that,we will see, lo and behold! That 1,75,00,000 rupees, at 6% inflation, after 30 years,it will be 1 crore.What does this mean? That today,what you can buy for 1 crore,after 30 years,1,75,00,000 rupeescan buy them.This is the inflation calculator.And this is importantbecause you will see alot of money in your bankbut the value of that money,after some years,it will be quite less. And still,it is a sizable amount.In other words,In other words, in 2023,if you want a simpleformula to invest, it is that for 30 years,5,000 rupees,every month,which is going to become less and lessdifficult for you to do.If you invest 5,000 per month, it will grow at 12% then after 30 years,in your bank, the money that you see, itâs valuewill be 1 crore rupees.You would haveinvested only 18 lakhs,and for yourself,you would have earned 1 crore. This is investment.This starts with 5,000 rupees.In this, if I make small changes.If I change 12% to 15%, you see that.3,50,00,000 rupees.And 3,50,00,000 inthe inflation calculator to see what itâs value will be,it will be 2 crore rupees.Just changing 12% to 15%.Now how will it gofrom 12% to 15%.If you buy a mix of mutual funds.12% is given byany mutual fund that invests in Nifty 50.More or less,in the next 30 years,Nifty 50 will grow at 12%.This is a common belief.But even if you invest in midcap, medium-sized companies,or you invest in smallcap,small-sized companies. But you do it in a form where your risk is managed,you can easily hit 15%.A good way of doing that is if you invest 100 rupeesevery month in mutual fund SIPs,then donât take a lot of SIPs. Donât take a lot of mutual funds. Itâs stupid.What you need to dois only in 3 mutual funds.I do this. So I will recommend this. 60 rupees out of 100,invest in Nifty 50index mutual fund. 25 rupees,invest in midcap 100 index mutual fund.And then, 15 rupees, invest in smallcap 100And then, 15 rupees, invest in smallcap 100index mutual fund. Nifty 50.Midcap.Smallcap.Invest in these three.Use any bank. HDFC. SBI.Nippon.It doesnât matter.Go with something that you feel secure with. Go with something thatyou feel isgoing to be thereafter 30 years as well. And then,invest in Nifty 50,midcap 100,smallcap 100and forget it.For 30 years,forget itand you will easily get a 15-18% range. After tax deductions, itâll be close to 15%.And in that,your 5,000 rupeeswould become 3.5 crorewhose valuewould be 2 crores today. Today!This is brilliant.Number 4.With all these going on, Ankur, we willhave to take a loan.Education loan.Vehicle loan. Home loan.And weâll have topay it back as well. It will have interest too. How to deal with that?So, number 4financial calculator,which is extremely important,is the loan repayment calculator. Letâs have a look.This loan repayment calculator is made by me.Weâll share its link too.Weâll share link forother calculators as well.To use this,you need to downloadthe Excel from the linkand then use it.How does this work? Imagine that youhave taken a loanof 50 lakh rupees.Letâs assume itâs home loan.A home loan.Interest rate is 8%.Tenure is 25 years.This is usually the construct.Your EMI would bearound 40,000 rupees.38,591 rupees,to be precise. So, in 25 years, you will pay back 50 lakhs,because it's theprincipal amount.And on top of that,youâll pay 65 lakhsas interest.65 lakhs as interest.The principal you had,almost 20% more than itwill be the interest you pay.So, you have topay the principal and top of that,120% as interest. And this is not smart.How stupid is that?!And youwant to repay this faster. I have a wayin which this 25-year loanwill become a 10-year loan.And here is how it works. Number 1.Every year, you pay one extra EMI.Meaning instead of 12 EMIs,you will pay 13 EMIs. And why will you do that.Youâll do that becausethe extra 13th EMI,with that,youâll pay the principal.So letâsdo that. Just one EMI. Pay extra EMI every year.Let's do that.And the minute you do that, hereâs what happens.The principal you had,50 lakhs. It is there. But from 65 lakhs,your interest is nowonly 50 lakhs only.And thisFrom 65 lakhs, your interest went down to 50 lakhs.Meaning 15 lakhs ininterest was waved off by just payingone extra EMIper year. But through this,your tenure is also reduced. So, letâs just see your;and it's the outstanding amount.This is youroutstanding amount.When this outstanding amount is zero,we know that theloan had been paid.And this happens at 240th month. Meaning 25-year loan is already a 20-year loan.Paying just one extra EMIevery year.And in that extra EMI, how much did you pay?You paid a total of only 7 lakh33 thousand.Meaning you paid 7,30,000 rupees,33,000 rupees, to be precise, and through that, you saved 15 lakh rupees. Itâs a very smart move. And second.Every year,you will increase your EMI. Letâs start with10%.If every year, you increase your EMIby 10%.Meaningthe first year, your EMI was 38,591 rupees butthe next year, you increase itto 42,450 rupees.The next year after that,increase it to 46,695 rupees. Next year, increase it to 51,364 rupees. Next year,56,501 rupees.You will do all of this and look at the impact. Your interestdecreased from 65 lakhs to just 26 lakh rupees. Not just this,your loan now; Wow!120 months,meaning within 10 years,you paid it back. Within 10 years,your entire 25-year loan is finished.Only by making 2 changes. One extra EMI,whose value willalways be the same.The original EMI.38,591 rupees.This will not increase.This will remain same. 38,591 rupees at the end of the year towards the principal, you will pay.Youâll tell the bankthat I donât wantto decrease the EMI.Instead, I want toincrease the EMIs.I want to reduce thetenure of my loan.And when you are paying this amount, 38,591 rupees, youâll also tell the bank, âThe EMI I had last year, increase it by 10%.âAnd when you do this, mathematically,your one 25-year loanwill be paid in 10 years.This is a financial calculator everyone needs for 2023.Because this year isgoing to be difficult.Recession is going to hit.The next 1-2 yearswill be very difficultfor many people. So, the more you canreduce the load of your loan, the more easily you can manage your money.And you will have to make sure that you are getting this technique right.Which brings usWhich brings us to the fifth and the lastfinancial calculator for 2023. And that is,to live your life,how much money do you need? Itâs an interesting question.If I ask youhow much money are you chasing? Do you know the answer? Maybe you donât. But do you know the problem behind it? If you donât know how much money you are chasing, then your entire life, youâll keep chasing.If I ask youhow much moneyare you chasing? Do you know the answer? Maybe you donât.But do you know theproblem behind it?If you donât knowhow much moneyyou are chasing, then your entire life, youâll keep chasing. If you donât know at how much moneyyou should stop,and after stopping, you should decide how do you want to live life; Live life differently. Live life the same way.Want to do something else.You will continue to dowhatever youâre doing todayand that may not bethe right thing to do.There are many people who work for money but they feel thatafter earning money,theyâll be free one day.But they donât knowwhen that day will come?So, Iâve build thisfinancial calculatorSo, Iâve build this financial calculator which is to live your life,how much money do you need? Start with that amount.Because the day when yousee that amountin your investments,you can change the course of your life. Letâs understand this.For this financial calculator,you will divide your life in 3 parts.Number 1.Cost to live life.Number 2.Cost of desires in life. Number 3. Cost of planning in life.Letâs understand these three. Number 1. Cost to live life.So whatever yourcurrent expenses are, you willlist them and you will also list how much those expensesare expected to grow?Itâs inflationaccording to you.For example.I have done this.In a year,I spend this much on clothes,this much health insurance, this much on eating out, on library for my kids, on subscriptions, for books,on gifts for people,my water and electricity bills, life insurance expenses,expenses on food and water,expenses on car and petrol,house expenses,travel expenses,school fees,home EMI expenses.All of this is listed.This are for a year.My total expenses for a yearare around 47,15,000 rupees.And then, I also assumedthe rate at whichit will grow. So I am saying my clothes expensewill rise at the inflation rate.6% And so on and so forth.And till when it will rise? So, I have decided that till I am 75,I will buy clothes. After that, I wonât.Health insurance is needed for life. Eating out will stop after 75.Library for kids. Half of it will go on till 50.Other half will go on till 56.After that,they will pay it themselvesbecause the kids wouldhave grown up.So on and so forth.And so this isthe entire detail.This is cost to live life.Today,and extrapolatedto the future using agrowth rate.Then comesplanned expenses in life. So our life has only 2 planned expenses. And they are education for both kids. Educationfor one kid,we have assumedto be 1.5 crore. 1.5 crore today. And we have assumed that it will grow at 6%.And when I will be 49; I am 42 right now. So, after 7 years,weâll need this 1.5 croreof today.It means at that time,this 1.5 crore will have different value.Itâll be much greater growing at 6%. And then,another 1.5 crorefor our second kidand weâll need that at 55. And that will bethe 2 planned expenses.And then our desires. I have 2 desires.Number 1. To go to Mars.And this is my childhood desire.And I have assumed that when I am 55, I can go to Mars, or till when I am 55,I will earn enough for it.And it will costaround 3 crore rupees.And second. After I die,I want to start a foundation. And that foundationâs seed capital,I want to startit at 5 crores.So, I want thatthe 5 crores of today,it should start that.When I will be 60, it should start then.And then,it needs to be grown at 5%. So, these areall the things that I have planned for my life.Now, if we plot this then what you will see isaccording to age, how do your expenses rise? Assuming the growth rate.And then, you will also decide, you will also plothow much you willneed for planned expenses? So, when I will be 49,for my first kidâs education, at that time,Iâll need 3 crore rupees,which are 1.5 crores today.When I will be 55,at that time, Iâll need 4,75,00,000 rupees,which are 1.5 crores today. Same.For the foundation,when I will be 60,Iâll need 13,26,00,000 rupees, which are 5 crores today. And trip to Mars.When I will be 55,Iâll need around4 crore rupees,which are 3 crores today.When I do all of thisand I sum allthe expensesand then I add a unexpected factor.Because this plan is there but you are not God.You havenât seenyour future life.Anything can happen. So I assumedthat 25% asthe unexpected factor.So, for every expensewhich will;At the age of 42,my expensewill be 51 lakhs.And I assume that around 13 lakhs rupessin unexpected expensewill be there.So, the total expense is 64 lakhs.And for this,I calculatea Net Present Value,because this is the value in future.Today,what is the importanceor the value of this money? And when I do that;64 lakhs at the age of 42is equal to 61 lakhs at the age of 40,which is for me.And this means total value, total money that I need to live my life,that is 41 crore rupees.Now these 41 crores, I donât need it today.This is thetotal amount I would need over the course of my life.So, if I can, today,get 22,60,00,000 rupeessomehowand put iton a 10%annual return cycle,  then after taxes,Iâll earn 6.5% only. It will, every year, take care of my expenses for that year and that ensuresthat this 22,60,00,00 rupees are enough for meto live my whole life.I wantnearly 40 crore rupees.Butthese 22 crores, after investing,I can take care ofmy yearly expensestill the pointwhen I donât need money anymoreand that isat the age of 100.So, I have assumed that I will live till I am 100. If I die before thatthen a lot of moneywill be saved. But I live till 100then at when I am 100, this moneywill be exhausted becauseeverything that I neededto do at that point would be done with and over.Now, the same thing, you can do for yourself.You can startassuming that you are 23 years oldor anything else.You can assume 27and it will startand you will start entering. Your rent.Your EMIs.Your clothes.Your expenses of eating out.Whatever.All of these things.Whatever yourfuture expenses are.School fees of your kids.School fees of your kids.Your household expenses. Things you want to buy.Your vehicle expenses.Your marriage expenses,if you want to doExpenses for your parents.Any other expenses. And all of those things that you will add and with all that,you will understand that in order to live your life,how much money do you need?The day you get that money, that day you know that you can now change the direction of your life.These 5 financial calculators, in 2023,are important for every person. With all of these,for your personal finance, for your personal freedom, take a step forward and I am sure you will not regret it. Ankur Warikoo.Signing off.
