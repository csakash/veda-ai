Zoom is here as well.Okay, perfect.Welcome to the conversation, Rajiv.So happy to have you.So happy to talk to you.It's been a while Ankur,but awesome seeing what you're doingand how you're impacting everyonein Indiaand absolutely happy to chat with you.Thank you so much, man. Thanks a lot.So today's conversation,I wanted to specifically ask youthree questions,which my audience would care about.One is usually during a timeof economic difficulty,let's call it recession or recessionary,a lot of people go back to the basics,hold on to your job,don't leave that financial independence,so on.But facts also show that this could beone of the best times to start up.So I wanted to get your opinion on that.First question.Second is,I would love for youbecause you've been an entrepreneurand a very successful one.I loved Urban Ladder, still continued to,and you were at the helm of itfor so many years,and you now are runningthe role of an investor.So you've seen both sides.If you can walk my audience through,what are the different typesof funding events/momentsin a founder's journeythat they should care about?And how does that mental math even work?Like, when people walked into a Shark Tankand say, oh, I want 6 crores for 2%,how does that number even work?Where do they come with that?And how do the Sharks react to that?And in your case, maybe you're reacting.And then, number three,if somebody wishes to start up in 2023is looking for funds,what would be the different avenuesfor them to do so?And I would love for you to also speakabout Antler, which is what you represent.So these are the three questionswe want to cover.Let's start with the first one.Do you believe or do you thinkor do you have a hunch that 2023could be a good year for starting up?I very strongly believe,not just because of the rolethat I play with Antler.It's just because--And not just because of the past datathat shows that someof the biggest unicornsand the biggest companies of this worldwere built in down cycles.And I think there is some good reasonfor it, right?One, there's a lot of smart peoplethat attach themselvesto bigger companies.And those smart people,when these companies are nowin a bit more of a maintenance modeand cost cutting mode,they get bored, right?And when smart people get bored,that's sort of the best sourceof entrepreneurship. Right?So a lot of those peoplewho had great opportunities in 21and early part of 22before the cycle actually went down,I think they need something to throwtheir intellectual capacity against.Right?So you have, one, a lot of smart peoplecoming into the fold again.So that's the start of it.Two, you also have a bit of a clean upthat happens, right?When I say cleanup, in 21, 22 what happensis because there's so much capital,there is so much talk of entrepreneurship,anyone and everyonewants to become a founderwhen anyone and everyonewants to become a founder.One, there are too many peopleworking on the same idea.Two, there is too much capitalthrown at people.And you can't differentiate.You can't easily differentiate.Everyone has the same pedigree.Everyone is from a good unicorn,soonicorn, whatever else,it becomes very difficult to differentiatenow, in this time period,to become a foundermeans that you really are doing itfor sort of the joy of building a company,for building a legacy,for solving a real problem.So really the serious foundersonly become foundersat a time like this,not anyone and everyone who comes at it.For me, these are twoof the strongest factors.And third one is of coursewhat happens is, there is still capital.It's not that just because the marketis "relatively lesser" in terms of sizecompared to, let's say, one year back.It's not that venture capitalistor amount of capital is any lesserbecause what happened in 21is a lot of the venture capitalistone, India I think had an explosioncompared to 2012,Ankur you built nearbyand compared to 2012-2013 and today, 10.I would say there are 10Xmore venture capital firmsand each venture capital firmhas 10X more capital.There are 10X more sources of capital alsowhich we will cover in the third question.So which essentially meansthe capital is still there.So where will the capital go?It can't sit in the bank.It can't sit in the bank and get interest.So there is really a lot more capitalbecause it's not being thrownat companies which are just being started.There are fewer opportunities,which means more capitalcan go to lesser companiesand give them more ammunitionto walk throughsome of these tougher times.Because companies are getting startedin tougher timesmeans it's going to take a bit more timeto get the same amount of traction.For all these three reasons,maybe I would believethat it is a better timefor the serious founderswith smart problem statementsto actually start companiesduring the "downtime"rather than the up-time.That's a great point of view.Sorry, sorry. Please go ahead.As I said, obviously my role at Antlermakes me maybe a bit biasedto say that the great founderswill come during this yearand the next yearwhen the market is probably going to be,I would say less--I would say lesser relative terms,but I would say,because at the end of the day,this is the thing.At one level today, if you go to a roomand ask how many peoplehave bought from Flipkart or Amazon,I think 95/100 people will answer yes.10 years back,that number would have been 5-10 peoplebecause even Flipkart and Amazon were new.So it's a one-way movement.The number of people have orderedfrom a Swiggy,the number of people who have used Paytmor PhonePe or whatever else.It's almost 100% in a room,which essentially meansthat this is a one-way thing.The other, all of us, and I knowyou're a very strong believer in that,is this is as a countrywe are a countrywhich is a developing country.The only way the countryis going to move forwardis a lot of very smart peopleare going to be building companiesand a lot of people like youare motivating peopleto be building companiesand go towards their potential.So it essentially meansthat an environmentlike this is actually goldin terms of actually starting up.Because someone has an idea,they have the passion to go after it.They could be a college student,they could be a 45 year old.In India, a lot of usdon't have too much of a money problemin terms of lifestyle.We don't have exorbitant lifestyle,certainly it's not too many people.They have the word "middle class"is used quite well that way.So to run a middle class lifestyle,you need a particular amountof money in the bank.And now with the amount of capitalthat's there, this is as good a timebecause you have so many peoplewho are digital.Jio has come in,the whole movement has thereVCs have money.It is a serious time to start up.So for all those reasons,I would say this is probablyone of the best years you can start up.Awesome, I love that.And I share the same enthusiasm, Rajiv,you and I have gone throughthe 2008 cycle,we've gone through the 2015-16 cyclewhen there was a funding winter,if you will.Not enough things were happening.And it's not a surprise that 2008 or sosaw the emergence of Flipkartand so many others.15 saw the absolute pinnacleof the likes of Fintech, Paytmand all coming through.And of course, so much more.Food delivery started becomingsuch a big thing around that time as well.And I love the fact that you saidit's a one way street.It's actually a one-way street.You may have ups and downs along the way,but zoom outand you just see a fairly straight line.We are blessed to be in this countryat this point.It is probably the best country to bebecause as Antler we have a networkacross other countriesand you also travel.And the kind of sentiment that you hearfrom other countriesis so very different.Last year also, and this year also,and the one-way street is very importantbecause the problem with one-way streetsalso is when the highs are so high,which is what happenedin this country also in 21,the lowers are also going to feel lower,which means that the layoff news,all the reasons why you don't start up.You hear a lot of layoff news.Oh shit, my job needs to be there.Are people getting enough money?I'm hearing all negative things.No more unicorns.Every week there were two unions,now there are no unicorns.I think all of that is just complete...It is the newsthat has made you feel that way.For you to start upand get you the first 10 customers,you have to completely zone outfrom all of that stuff and just go build,as long as you believethat you have a problemto go after in a very serious way.Makes sense.Absolutely makes sense.I was just making notes of thesefor reflection.If this is the case,and at least you and I agreethat this is the case,then I would love for you to now takealmost like a Puritan teacher approach,Rajiv, and walk people through.What are the steps and stagesfor a founder to raise money?What is usually the basison which they can raise money?Because there is now an entire generationthat is only aware of somethinglike a Shark Tank.And with all due respect,it sounds almost as if you can walk inand walk out.While It's nearly not as easy.And you and I understand that fully.So if you could help peopleappreciate the nuances of itand also be systemic around it,what is it that you need to prepare for?Yeah, I think Shark Tankhas been a phenomenal institutionin terms of inspiration for the audiences.But of course,it is one sort of way to raise moneyand sort of one very extremelydramatized way to get the money.Even the people who are on Shark Tank,a lot of them are I am suregood friends of yours,good friends of mine.They didn't go, do it that way.They went in a very different way.I think, if I were to,and I'll try and paint this picturein a very, as simplified way as possible,but please interjectif you feel otherwise.I think, first of all,I would saythere are only certain kinds of businessesthat even need money.And I say that need money,that need external money.Now, unfortunately, there is not too muchliterature in this country that sayswhat kind of businessesneed venture capital,what kind of businessesdon't need venture capital.But really the word startupis actually not associatedwith everyone that's starting up.It is actually associatedwith companies that need continuous,we call it the VC treadmill.You need continuous capitalto grow at a particular stage,a particular scale,so that you can attain scalein a much faster timethan if you don't raise the capital.For that, you need the abilityfor the business to be able to do it,and you need the ability of the founderto be able to grow and do it.So if I were to first,it's almost like a flow chart.Say that there are certain businessesthat just do not need external capital.There are certain businessesthat need external capital, first up.Let's go the route of they do not needexternal capital.Now, what could those businesses be?Ankur, you run a businessa very successful businessthat in 2 years you have been profitable.And it doesn't looklike you've raised external money.You've sort of literally,sort of "bootstrapped" it.And when I say bootstrapped it,you pretty much did that capital.You put in a seed capital,you grew a team, you got some revenues,you got revenues from customerscould be advertiserswho could be customerswho ask you to talk,then reinvest the money backand grow the business at a very fast rate,And you've grown and bootstrapping,especially for businessesthat can be either digital or softwareor services oriented,is a phenomenal wayto actually run the business.And we have--In this country we have 2-3 unicorns also.Companies that are valuedmore than a billion dollars,which took some very fast,some much slower, like Zoho or Zerodha,which have been completely bootstrapped.They may have raised some little moneyhere and there, from friends and family,but really they didn't gothe venture institutional route.A lot of businesses in this countryfall into this bucket.They shouldn't be raising venture capital.They don't need external capital.They can either raise small amounts,and there are multiple ways to do that.They could get a grant.There are so many grants availablein certain spaces.It could be a student grant,it could be a health care grant,it could be government grant.It could be customers money.You sort of go put a kickstarter.You get customers money in advanceto go produce somethingand then give them the productafter a time,and customers have to believe you.Or it could be from friends and family.It could be even a loan.It could just take a loanand then repay that loan back.I would say 90% of businessesprobably fall into this bucket.In this country,probably 15,000-20,000 businessesstart in this country.I would say approximately around 14,000of it probably fall into this bucketin terms of,they don't actually need capitalor they don't end up raising capital.And the obvious ones are there.You start a small business.You start a shop, you start all those,it just makes more senseto keep it to non-equity funding largely.usually, right?So there are variety of ways therewhich is so.That's why I said I'll startwith the fork on the road,which is non-institutional funding.Then you go the second route,which is, let's say you decidethat, okay, you need external capitaland you want to get into this treadmillwhere you're going to giveexternal capital for some equityin your company.Let's say, it's very difficult,at the start.I think one of the questions you askedduring the conversationis how do you value,I think,more than JK Rowling and Harry Potter,there is more fiction in this partwhich is valuationof early-stage companies,So, I would sayyou somewhere as a founder,have to tell a storythat you're going to buildthis massive institutionin the next 5-10 years,which needs a particular scalein terms of technology, scale,people, brand, and for thatit is a bit of a revolutionyou are creating in that space.Now, revolutions need external moneybecause they are going at a pacethat a normal market growth cannot handle,which means that you need to startwith some kind of capital.Now, what is this external capitalin the quantum?There are people who could dowith â¹20 lakhs also.There are people who might needâ¹20 crores also, right?Of course, there are peoplewho raise 200 crores alsoat the time of starting.But let's keep them asidebecause these are the people who,because they have a strong ecosystemand network and sort of brand,they're able to do it.But now, whether you need 20 lakhsor whether you need 20 croresis completely based on, I would say,the next milestone,which means, in a treadmillit's always about the next milestone,and the next milestoneYou're not going to raise all the moneythat's required for the next 5 years.You're going to raise moneythat is required for the next 12-18 monthsto get from a pointwhere there is nothing to showto a point where there is somethingto show and tell a story.So, it's almost likeyou're creating this epic.And every funding aroundis a story in the epic.And it might have 10 storiesto make that epic,or 10 chapters to make a story.And at the end of every storythere is a hand-off pointwhere there's going to bea new part to the story.This is literally the wayyou should lookat a venture capital cycle,A lot of people ask,why do these companies need so much money?Why are they still not profitable?They're missing the point.And I'll say they're missing the pointbecause the waya venture capital business is runis not about profits.In the first bucket,where you have to fund yourself,you need profitsbecause how else will you fund yourself?In this there is an external sourceof capital.Now, that external source of capitalis coming at a very expensive part.They're taking a stake in your company.They're taking an ownershipin your company, which also meansthey will make certain executive decisionsalong with you as a founder.In the first case, you have full power.You can shut down the company tomorrow.You can do whatever you wantwith your company.In the second case,you have venture capitalistsand private equity at later stagesto be able to take someof these strategic decisions with you.That is why they are comingon this ride with you,Because they're putting a lot of moneybehind you.They know thatthere is a statistical chanceof this completely failing,millions of dollars going down the drain.Profitability might take 10 years,12 years,but they are in it because one,they believe that when this becomes big,this could be super big.And two, they have a seat at the tableto make decisions, to drive the strategyalong with you as a founder,of course, you are running the business.No venture capitalist wants to intervenein the running of the business,but you're at least running the business.So, the way I would look at it is,at a very simplistic,again, on this venture route,one, you have early-stage funding.Again, you can today, of course,5-7 years back when we did this,it was only institutionsthat would provide the capital.Today there are a lot of individualswho are sitting on a lot of moneywho are also providingthat same level of capital.Some of them are called syndicates,some of them are called angel networks,some of them are calledincubators, accelerators.There are a variety of institutionsbeyond venture capitalthat is able to providethe capital at the very first stage.I'll talk about Antler in the third part.Two, how do you go about it?It is a treadmill,which means that you raise some money,you show some traction,or you show the first versionof the productyou raise the next round.First round in our jargonis called the pre-seed round nowadays.Once you raise the pre-seed round,the assumption is thatthere is a 90-95% chance of failurefrom that round, by the way.From the pre-seed round,there's only 10% chancethat you'll actually get to the next stagein the next 12-18 months.You either show the first set of customersor some paying customers.Depends on the industry you are in.You just show that someonereally wants to use this product,or the first version of the product.You build what is called MVP,which is the minimum viable product.You go launch it out.You probably are just you as a founderand maybe 1-2 more people.It's a very, very small team.You haven't recruited.You don't have the moneyto recruit someone.You maybe market outsome part of that productto get some customersat the end of it what might happen?You might get some customers.It might be a super hit.That it takes off really well.It might be a super flopthat it does not take off at all,or something in between.Based on that, you tell the storyfor the next round,which is the seed round,and then you go to the Series A round,and then you go to the Series B round.Usually this is sort of, as I said,a treadmill, where the next roundmeans that you take more capitaland also take the whole businessto a next level.You'll have more people,you'll probably have more geographies,you'll certainly have more revenues,you'll probably have 2-3 products.So, every roundthere is a "chance of failure"and everything going to dust,which is the whole gameof venture capital.But at the same time,you have these momentswhere you go throughand build the institution,grow in the process,and over a five-seven-year period,maybe for some people it takes 10 years.For some people,maybe it happens in four years.You have this mammoth companythat is serving millions of customers.And you have a teamthat is probably 1000 people.And you probably have raised $100 millionacross three, four stages.Or this might have not gone anywhere.Because there is a statistical chancethat you fail at every stagebecause something is not workingto the next stage.Which is why this is exciting,exhilarating, interesting,but is not for everyone.It is maybe less than 10% of the peoplewho should even go through this routebecause it is so intense.It is so intense.And there is such a high chance of failureon this route compared to the first route.I'll pause here.I know it was a big monologue.Happy to go deeperinto any of these aspects.No, I love this.I love this claritybecause it's necessary, Rajiv,thank you for sparing time for this.I had one follow-up question,which I anticipate from my audience,and that is,when you--Is there a thumb ruleor a yardstick or a metric?Because this is a questionI get asked quite often.I've been doing this for Xand X could be one day,1 hour, one year,maybe even four years,and a lot of people get confusedthat the time you've spentin getting readyfor that startup/running that startupis going to definewhat stage of funding/capital funding,do you raise?And you and I know that, that's not truebecause nobody frankly caresabout that time.What they care aboutare several other things.So for somebodywho is thinking of raising money,at what point do they knowwhat stage of fundingshould they raise?Or is it always going to be needirrespective of where you started?So this is an interesting question.Obviously, there are next levels to it,but as I said, I'll explainthe four kinds of fundingat a very broad level.First is what we callthe pre-seed super early stage,right, which is wherea lot of the platformsas I said individuals,syndicates, incubators,accelerators, generators,platforms come in.The second is early-stage funding,which is where the venture capitalecosystem comes in.Third is where,and venture capital itselfhas early stage and late-stageventure capital.Third is of course, private equityin terms of where much later stageabout profitability and scale up.Fourth is, I would say,there is a separate class of instrumentscalled venture debt,which is debt capital.Now I would say if okay,so even within this,if you were to simplify it,if you're building a software businesswhich is, let's say profitablebut is growing at maybe2-3X every yearon some of the bigger...you could actually go for somethinglike private equity itself.Because you're already profitable.You want to still scale up.You don't want to go the bootstrap route.You still want a capitalso that you can go international fasteror you're getting competitionfrom multiple people.So, you want to productize somethingand you're already in the revenuesin the hundreds of crores of rupees.Then you can think of private equityor even venture debtbecause you have a clear line of business.Let's flip to the other side,which is you have started somethingand you have not, literally have nothingmore than a prototypeyou have and/oryou're building a pure consumer businesswhere you don't knowhow to monetize it today.Don't have any visibility,but there are hundredsand thousands of usersthat you think will use itand at some future point in time monetize,like a Facebook,Facebook for the first many years5-7 years, had no cluehow to make money off it.If you are one of those businesses,you can go for early-stageventure capital fundingbecause you need money to get users.You have no ideahow the revenue is going to come.And of course,then there are other kinds of businesseslike production businesses,manufacturing businessesand a variety of otherswhich have other meansof raising money.Because venture capitalat a very initial level,venture capital started offfor software businessesas sort of the anchor.I mean not the historical venture capital,but the assumption was,if you're building software,you can scale it up fasterbecause you just add more serversand you should get more people.You quote something.So, if it is outside of that D to C brand,you're building a physical world business,which needs marketing,which needs revenues,but it also needs productionand supply chain.Then you need some capital.And usually, of course,today there's venture capitalthat does D to C also.So, I would saythe answer has obviously multiple layers,physical worldversus digital world businesses,early-stage digital worldversus late-stage digital world,consumer versus enterprise.There are these different sort of cutsthat you would have to use.So, it's not a singular answer,but I would say at the end of the day,this word product market fit is so usedin this industrythat if you know something is taking off,you can just go talk to a lot...You can use resources on the internet,you can talk to a lot of peopleand they will actually tell youwhen something is taking off.Which is the best sourceof capital for you.If something is not taking off,there is probably no source of capitalthat will help you.Makes sense. Makes sense.I love that statement.It's actually a great takeaway.Awesome. Which brings usto the most important conversation,if you will,and that is, now that we know all of this,how do we raise funds?And I'll tell you a few challengesthat come through.One, people fundamentally believethat if they're not fromthe IITs or the IIMs,they have no chance.because almost everyoneis going after them.Two, they believe that if they don't comethrough a referenceor through a network,there is no hope in hellthat anybody will notice.Three, then they think of the Shark Tankand they feel that,that's the only way to do it.But I love it that, that's justthe dramatized way of raising it,and one of the many ways of raising it,but certainly not the only one.So, if you could helpsomebody who perhaps has no network,no reference, solid idea,perhaps even traction,a great team,or maybe not even that,what are the different avenuesthrough which they can raise money?And I'd love to talk about Antler Indiaand what all does it dofor founders in the country?Sure. So, I'll start, the three thingsthat I thinkevery early-stage venture capitalistor anyone who is even providing capitallooks at.It's actually quite uniform, Ankur.One, they look for an individualwho has shownthat they are really passionateabout buildingand they are doing thisfor the right reasons,which means that this individualtypically will havea tremendous amount of drive.They would have done somethingin their past life.It could be even in college,it could be in their work experience,it could be even at home,that they're always very impatientto get things doneand leave their legacy.They want to leave their legacy.And they would have shown some micro wayin which they have shown this.It could be a school project,it could be a college festival,it could be a company event.It could be whatever it is.And they have this love for building.They have this love for buildingand showing something.They have this love for seeing impact.They have this love for hope.Some people are getting impactedby what I am doing.So, this individualwho is a founder personawould have shown that the abilityin something that they have done.So that is the first thing I would say,which is the founder personaof building,of being impatient for results,of moving things along,of creating a legacy,of wanting to see impactbeyond themselves.They're not doing workfor the sake of just work,they're doing work beyondbecause they believe in somethingbeyond themselves,beyond money.Beyond money is very important.At least that's my very strong philosophy.They usually do it for the joyof doing somethingthat's the first one.Second is what, you know, we callin the parlance of the VC world,a founder-market fit.Which is they are now working in a spacethat they are so passionate aboutthat they can't sleepwithout thinking of that space,and for solving a problem.Which means that they have identifieda customer segment,they have identified a problemwhich they are so passionateabout solving.Which is now again,do they have all the answers?Not at all.Because the actual version of this productmight be very different.But are they so obsessedabout the customerthat they can talkabout the customer's life,the customer's problem statement,the way the customer behavior would evolvefor hours on end.They can literally spend 4-5 hoursbecause they know this so in depth,they have spent so much timewith the customer.You will always see that with foundersbecause now when they do that really well,they actually becomevery good storytellers also.They will say okay,let's say I'm building an agri.The farmer spendsthis amount of time doing this,the farmer's cattle have this issue.This one has no age limit.We have a funded a founder,then I'll talk about Antler in a bit.But it could be a 16-year-old founder,it could be a 45-year-old founder.When you know founder-market fitis established,it is the depthat which they are able to talkabout the customerin that particular segment.That's what we callthe founder-market fit.So the first is the founder,second is the founder-market fit,third is the market itself.Now, the market is of coursewhere the trickier aspect comesbecause there's a lot of datathat's out there.You being in a market which is big,is something that VCs love.It's a very simple reason.If the market is very smallin 99 out of 100 cases,it doesn't grow as fastas what you think it would.And VCs, if they're investing,if they want companiesto become a unicorn,which is the proverbial wordfor a big companythat they want to be valuedat a billion dollars,the way the VC industry worksis it needs those unicornsto give money back from the peoplethat we raised the money from.Which means that you can't build a unicornin a market which is only$100 million worth.If there is only so much.Now, this is easier to triangulateand calculatewhere there already exists a lot of data.It is tougher in newer markets.For example,when Facebook did social networkingin 2005-2006,the social networking marketwas close to zero.Even when we did Urban Ladder in 2012,the online furniture marketat that time was zero.The furniture market was $20 billion.So I think it is about predictingwhat might be the marketbased on certain behaviors.And this is where a very smart foundercan completely change a VCor anyone's opinion by telling a story.I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg,everyone poked this hole at himsaying that, hey,what is the social networking market?How will you make money here?And he would have been like, hey,when 100 million peoplecome into that space,advertisers will come.It's somethingthat you would have to believe.So you have to,where there is a market size,show the depth of the market size.Where there is no real market size,show a story.But the only requestthat is don't fool yourselfjust to prove that the market size is bigbecause VCs will poke holes.And while you need only one believer,there's a lot of data also to saythat people don't believe generally.So I would say, founder,founder market fit, and marketare the three biggest thingsthat anyone at the early stage looks at.Because at the end of the day,there is nothing else to look at,at that stage to give you money.You only have youwhat you have done in the past,your passion for solving something.And three, that this market is somethingthat really there is a consumer needand there's money in that marketbased on these three.At the end of the day,you need one investorin 150 people that you might pitch to.Because as I said,you need enough money to take youto the next point in the treadmill.So I would say this is what at leastVCs at the earlier stage look at.Of course, once you launch a productat the next stageand the next stage peoplelook at more things.How happy are your customers?How good is your team?What are the thesis,what're the product extensions you can do,what is the competition like?All of that stuff.But those are allfor slightly more later stages.Got it.And I'd love to know more about Antlerand how does that help foundersin the country?Okay, so Antler, I would sayjust to simplistically look at things,we either work with you,when you are not yet a founder.So, one part of what Antler doesis something called the Residency,where you have an ideayou're working somewhere.It could be a corporate,it could be a startup,it could be a soonicorn, unicornand you're just in the fag endof becoming a founder.And the Residencyis something that we run twice a yearfrom next yearwe will run this twice a year.We get 100 of you into a room.When I say a room,part of it is physical in Bangalore,but most of it is digital,wherever you are,Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Chennai,wherever it is.And we actually help you do two things.One, we help you find your co-founder,and two, we help you narrow downthe last three ideas that you haveinto one idea along withthe right co-founder that you pick.Now, these are two seeminglylook like maybe trivial problems,but not at all.The right co-founder,who is the best personalityto work with you,who brings in enough complementary skills,who is as passionate about the space,is very difficult to find.It's not that easy.A lot of people tend to startwith their college mates,their workmates,but they may not be the ideal co-founderbecause it's a 10-year journey.And to build a successful startup,you need a pairwhich is the best combinationto go after the problemnot just someone familiarto go after the problem.So that's the Residency.And we're running our second versionof the Residency.The way Antler works is...people into the room.We give a stipend for a 3-month program,help you find your co-founders,find your idea.Some people will do it,some people, first of all,may not find the right person.And that's possiblebecause you don't get the chemistry matchwith someone, or you don'tsome of them even realizethat they don't want to becomea startup founder.The point that I saidthey don't want venture capital,that also happens.Some will find a founder,some will go after a problem statement.But maybe the market sizeis something we don't believe is big.So, we may not fund them.Almost a thirdor the last third of themwho find a founderwho are able to pitchand who are able to find a marketthat we also believe is big enough,then we fund them, $250,000for 10% stake in their companyand then take themto the next point in the treadmill,which is the seed round.So what we do is the pre-seed round,we work with themfor the next 6-9 months, this formed team,and take them to the seed roundto help them raise a million to $2 millionin the next round.We are sector agnostic.It could be software, it could be D to C,it could be any sector,it could be SAS, it could be consumer,it could be enterprise.So, we are sector agnostic.We are consumer agnostic.Just to give you some sense of the datawe picked,in the last cohort we picked 70 peopleout of 2,500 applicationsSo, it's not easy to get in.Out of the 70, we funded 16 of themSo, it's not easy to get the stipendas well as get funded.So, it's a pretty strong funnel that way.We also, interestingly,have a college versionof the same Residency.It's called the Fellowship,which is purely focused on college--college students in their final yearwho want to become founders.Because people who already havesome work experience,we feel that they have a particular kindof an experience.College people have a particular,slightly different kind of an experience.We give a bigger grant.The Stipend is much biggerfor college studentsbecause we understandwe expect them to come out of...we want to give them the assurancethat you are homeyour education loan is taken care of.He is undergrad meansthat's almost 10-15 lakhskind of a number.So, we give them a stipendclose to 10 lakhs,and we actually work with themfor 6 months, do the basicsof what it takes to be a venture founder.We pick lesser students.We don't work with 80 people here,we work with 20 people here.Higher stipend.And at the end of the 6 monthswe fund some of them.Same concept.So, we have the Residencyand the Fellowshipis one part of what we do.We work with you as an individualand literally in 6-9 monthsyou have a funded startupthat you are running.So that's the power of what we do.We have done 32 investments till now,but that's not the only thing that we do.If you already have a teambecause you found your co-founderin your startupand you've already started up,then also you can apply to us asas long as you have not yet launched.So, we do work with existing teams,not just you as an individual.In that case, we take it case by case,and we call that directpre-seed investment.We don't run a program.We respond to you much faster.We don't have to sit with youfor 3 months or 6 months.We can make a decision in 10 days.There what we do is we help yougo to market globally.Because Antler is present in 25 countries.It's a very new company, relativelyin India it's two years old.In the world it's four years old.But we are present in 25 countries.And because we're present in 25 countries,anyone who wants to build from Indiafor the world,we can take them to any marketthat's out there.That's the USP of Antler in a way.So, if you're an individualwanting to become a founder,you're already someonewho has become a founder,who has found their co-founderand has just started building.Both sets of people can come to Antler,and we'll make surethat your first 6-9 monthsare less strenuous, relativelyslightly less risky,and you have a higher chanceof being successful.That's what we do.But I can also put a caveatthat we have seen 20,000 foundersand we have only invested in 32.So, it's not a--It's a--And unfortunately, I thinkthat's the nature of it.Because, as I said, some of themneed to know that maybe venture capitalis not the right angle.as I said 90% of the peopledon't and should not be takingventure capital.Because the business has the market,so that's not their game.And, of course, many otherswho do believe and who's right,unfortunately, we can only workwith a particular set of people.Nothing against them.It's just our capacity.This year, we'll be doing30 to 40 investments.We have not yet started this year's count,so we are very actively investing.So, any of these two setsshould just look upantler.co/indiaGot it.And what will be the best way to apply?Antler.co/india is the website.So they can just if they searchfor Antler India on Googleor they just use this website,Antler.co/indiathey can actually go click apply.Awesome. Wonderful.I think we covered a lot, Rajiv.I love the confidencethat you're expressing in 2023to be a good year to start up.I love the clarity that you sharedwith the audienceon what are the different stagesand, of course,that you spoke about all the avenuesthat are available for founders.I do concurthat this could be the best decade,starting perhaps this year,to build in this country,whether for India,whether for outside of India.But there cannot be,and there certainly hasn't beena better time to buildwith all the infrastructurefinally in place,with everything that could back you up.And, of course, the world looking at Indiaas a mega power of not just talent,but also ideas.Thank you, Rajiv,for being a part of this ecosystem,both as a fellow founderand as an investor now.You're giving back in waysthat are very meaningfuland it makes a difference.Thanks for sparing time.Thanks Ankur. Thanks for having me.And thanks for tellingthe Antler story as well.And the only thing that I would leaveall of you with is,find the problem statementthat you are passionate aboutcapital will come to you.I think, I know it's a big statement,but if you're so passionateabout doing somethingand you believe that the next 5-10 yearsyou can actually create great impact,I think capitalwill just find its way to you.People will also find their wayto you as talent.It's just about finding the right problem.Agree. Couldn't agree more.Thank you so much.All the best, Rajiv,and thank you for joining us again.Thanks Ankur, thanks for having me.
