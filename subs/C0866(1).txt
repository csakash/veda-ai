the back cover ofthis month's book, it's written,'A single book can change your life.'And I would actually saythe same about this book.The name of this book is,The Courage to Be Disliked.If you read this book withan open mind, open eyes,it may actually change your life,because this teaches youfundamentals about life,which are highly hard-hitting,very controversial,and very counter-intuitive,but according to me,they are the truths of life.Let me try to give youthe background.There is a young person,they are struggling with their life,just like all of us,and he then approachesa philosopher.A philosopher who is in a Zen mode,talks to them very calmlyand patiently.The beautiful thing about this book is,most self-aid books keeptalking about just one thingrepeatedly,but this book is in the formof questions and answers.So you can see,the book asks questions,and then the philosopheranswers those questions,then again another question,and another answerby the philosopher.The young man asked questions,and the philosopher answers them.And that is all there is in the book,questions and answers.The reason why that is so effectiveis because this book hasso controversialand hard-hitting topics,that the moment we hear them,your instant reaction would be,'This is bullshit!This is not the truth!'And the beautiful thingthat the authors have done isthat all the questionsthat we have in our minds,they have put all of themin this book throughthat young man.So it's almost as if they arereading our mindsand going through it.In this video, I will share4 things with youthat this book taught me,and I think it will stay with mefor the rest of my life.This book has 5 chapterswhich are about 5 nights.5 nights when the young mangoes to that philosopher,and asks his questions,and then leaves with the hopethat when they come back,they get more clarity.Before I begin, it is importantto know what is the philosophyof this book based on.If you have ever read philosophy,or if you are its student,then there are a few namesthat are frequently mentioned.Sigmund Freud is consideredto be the bestand the most renowned philosopherof all time,but this is based on a philosophyabout which you and Ihave heard very less.And it's a guy called Adler,and this is Adler's philosophywhich is called Adlerian philosophy,and the philosopher in this bookis centered on the Adlerian conceptand way of life.The first and most importanttakeaway is,We are free to choosethe meaning of our experiences.We are free to choosethe meaning of our experiences.On the first night,the philosopher tries to talkto the young man about the trauma,which is very well establishedin the research of philosophy,whatever happens to us in our childhood,the way our parents behave with us,the way our friends behavewith us in school,all the incidents that happened with us,all of that creates traumain our lives,if it was a negative experience.And what Adlerian philosophy saysis that there is no trauma.When you listen to this,you feel like throwing away the book.You think it is a useless book,it is not somethingthat we can digest,but stay with the book,stay with me.And it says that whateverexperience we have,that experience isneither right nor wrong,it is just an experience,but it is we who can controland choose the meaningof every such experiencethat we go through,because there are enough peoplewho go through the exact same experience,and all that doesn't happenwith them which we think havehappened to us.There are a lot of peoplewho have gone througha lot of difficultiesin their childhood,and yet somehow,they went over and abovethose experiences.They have not let those experiencesoverpower them,but they chosea different meaningof those experiences.And there are enough peoplewho went through a very bad time,and they stayed with thatbecause they felt thatthat was the true meaningof their life,and their trauma.This was the biggest thingthat stayed with me in the book.It was the most difficult to digest,but if we think about itand understand it objectivelyand calmly, then graduallyit starts unraveling.And it led to the second pointof the book.And the second point isour emotions, our feelings,are tools to justify our actions.Our emotions are toolsto justify our actions.We feel that we cannotcontrol our emotions,we cannot overpower emotions.If we feel anger,then we are angry.Many times you say that,'I am not able to control my anger.'But here is a simple example.Let's say, parents,let's consider the father only,and the father is scoldinghis child for somethingthat they have done,which they felt was wrong.They have not done their homework,or pushed somebody, anything,and he is scolding withabsolute anger,and suddenly his best friend calls him,and they pick up the phone,and that anger instantlytransforms into love.They are like,'Hey, Ramesh! How are you, man?Yes, everything is ok.Dude, I am a little busy right now.Let me call you back in 5 minutes.Yes, see you, bye!'They keep the phone down,and then instantlythey are back to the anger.It's almost as if you cancontrol your emotions,you can choose her emotions,you can direct your emotions,but we don't think that way.We always believethat we cannot control our emotions,and that is not true.What the book says isthat our emotions are merelytools to justify our actions.We want to take that action,and we make our emotionsan excuse to undertakethat action.If you want to humiliate somebody,we make our anger and excuseto make that happen.If we want to make someoneunderstand or realize something,then we use are emotionsto express that.And that was something thatwas hard-hitting,which led to the thirdand perhaps the most criticallearning of this book.Every problem in our lives,the reason for itis interpersonal relationships.Interpersonal relationship problemis the reason for every problem.They say that all our problemsin life are becauseour interpersonal relationshipshave a problem.When I read this,I did not want to accept it,because how is it possiblethat if I do not have moneyin my life, then that isan interpersonal relationship problem?How is it possiblethat if I do not havelove in my life,or my parents don't love me,or I don't have friendsin my life,or I am an introvert in life,or whatever the case is,then that is an interpersonalrelationship problem?That is like giving anotherreason for another problem.But that is where the book,in my opinion,becomes the strongest.Because they say,try to think, every personis made of relationships only.The relationship we havewith ourselves.The relationship we have with others.And because of this relationship,we have all the problems in our life.In fact, Adler goes about saying,that try to imaginethat you are the only personleft on earth,then it's quite possibleyou would have no problemin your life.It only happens becauseyou have interpersonal relationships,and those relationshipspose a problem.Let's try to understand this.You think you are a loser.You think the biggest problemof your life is that you arenot able to clear your exams,you are not able to reacha good position in your life,and it could be becauseyou have taken the pressureof the expectations of your parentsand the society on your shoulders.It is possible that your parents,your family, your world,your friends, anybody,you are so much underthe pressure of their expectations,that you feel you are a loser,and that is the biggest problemof your life.Ultimately it isan interpersonal relationship problem.It is something that boils downto a relationship.If you feel you arenot doing well in life,you are not progressing,you don't have money,you are not able to invest,whatever the case may be,it could be because you careabout how the societyor the world will look at you.And all of that then becomesthe manifestationof interpersonal problems we have.Your relationship with yourself,if you don't treat yourself with love,if you don't treat yourself with respect,if you don't treat yourselfwith the level of respectthat you would giveto anybody else in your lifewho is important to you,then you are starting withan interpersonal problem,you are starting witha relationship that is broken.And this is what this booktries to make you understand.I am nearly not going to tell youwhat this book truly gives you,because this is a book thatI genuinely wanteach and every person in this worldto experience themselves.And that takes me to the lastand the final point thatI loved about this book.What is the name of this book?The Courage to Be Disliked.To have such courage which makes usindifferent to what peoplethink about us.We may not be even able to hearwhat people say about us.And if we reached that pointin our life where we havethe courage to be disliked,then we are truly free!Close your eyes, and imaginea world where you don't careabout what the world thinksabout you,you don't care aboutwhat the world says about you,you don't care aboutwhat kind of an impressionpeople have about you,you are truly free, my friend.You are so powerfulthat you can do anythingin the world,because you are free fromother people's expectations,their image, and their impressions,and that is what the book is about.These book reviews are nota replacement for reading the book,they are an encouragementto read the book.And if there is one bookthat I would love for all of youto read it will be this book because,'A single book can change your life.'Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
