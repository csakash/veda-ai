Number 1: Sell your skills.If you have any skill,then the whole world is ready to buyyour skill through the internet.Options are graphic designing,video editing, content writing,digital marketing.You can also make memes.For example, do you knowand it's not a promotion,but if you create memesand if you send those memes atmemes@ankurwarikoo.com,Then if your meme is selectedand goes on our profile,this is happening on Instagram,then you get â¹3,000,and I know of so many memerswho make money through memes.You can do translationor transliteration services.Basically, if you know any skill,then through platformssuch as Fiverr and Upwork,you can make your skill reach the worldand make money out of it.Number 2: Drop shipment.If you become a seller on Amazonor Flipkart, and try to sell a productthat the consumers want,then you can through the processof drop shipment start making money.What is a drop shipment?Where you are not the ownerof the product,you actually have a contract withthe supplier, let's say for books,and you have a customer froma marketplace, for example, Amazon,so there is a customerby the name of Ankurwho buys a book from Amazon,you are the seller,but you have sourced that book froma publisher,so as soon as you get that order,you to ask the publisher to send that bookto Ankur at this address.So it gets shipped to the customerfrom the owner of the product,you are just creating a link betweenthe two through a marketplacecalled Amazon.I know so many people who earn moneyonline through this.You can be a student.You can deal in fashion accessoriesfor men and women.You can deal in makeup products.You can deal in eatables.You can deal in various things in fashion,not just accessories,but it may be even shirts, pants,t-shirts, hoodies,whatever catches your fancy,and through drop shipment,you never have to go through buyingthat inventory.You will tell the order to the supplier,and ask them to send it,and you will collect the order througha place like Amazon.Great place to make money!Number 3: Help others do their task.If you are a good student,then you can help other studentswith their homework,and that is such a great wayto make money,not just as a student,but also as a working professional.If you know how to speak good Englishthen you can teach English to other peopleby becoming a tutor.This is also possible, and of course,it happens online.There are many platforms,Cambly for English tutoring,Chegg for homework,tutorme, tutor.com,all these destinations give youa chance to earn money as an online tutor.Number 4: Sell your distribution.If you have an audience in any form,let's say you have been writinga newsletter,and that's why a lot of people havesubscribed to your newsletter,so now you can actually make moneythrough monetizing that distribution.You can do affiliate marketing.Affiliate marketing is a great wayto make money online.For example, I do affiliate marketingon YouTube.Whenever I make any videos about books,or gifts to parents, or any other videowhere you see Amazon links,if you click on it and buy any product,then I get an affiliate incomewhich is a percentage of the revenue.When you see a Zerodha link and opena brokerage account by clicking on it,then I get a share of brokerage income,so on and so forth.This is called affiliate incomeand you can make money onlinethrough affiliate income throughthe distribution that you have built.I want to tell you thatthe affiliate incomethat I personally earn,100% of that goes towardsthe education of kidswho cannot afford it themselves.Last year, we distributed â¹36 lakhsto help 53 students.This year, this money will bealmost â¹50 lakhs, and I am sure it'll be,all thanks to you.Number 5: Teach and create a course.You must have seen the ads for my courses,and you might be fed up with them,but these courses generatealmost â¹18 crores a year for me.It's not because I am the smartest person,or the most hardworking,or I know something that nobody knows,I am just as normal as you,so if you have a course,something which you want to tell peopleand teach them, and you knowthat you are better than most othersin doing that,then convert it into a course.If not yourself then you can runthat course through a lot of platforms.Graphy allows you to do that.Frontrow allows you to do that.Maven allows you to do that.These are the websiteswhere you can create your course,and then using their infrastructure,their payment methods, live classes,quizzes, assignments,all that is built into the platform,so that you can properly performthe role of a teacher,sell your course to the students,do your work efficientlyand create an income stream.So that you properly performthe role of a teacher,give something to the students from whichthey will benefit,earn money through it and createan income stream for yourself.Number 6: Create intellectual property.Create something that only you own,and you want to sell it to the world,or people want to buy it from you.A good example of that isebooks.You make electronic books,and you sell that book fora very small price, maybe 99 cents,maybe one dollar 99 cents,maybe â¹49, maybe â¹29,and the point is not how much you earn,the point is how many peoplewill you be able to sell it to.You might be good at designing,and you post your designs onlineand try to sell them.You create great music,then you can record the themes of musicor background scores,and try to sell them.If you are good at photography,then you put up your photographsstock images online, and try to sell them.All of these are where you are bringingyour skill, and not selling the servicebut the actual product at the end of itwhich is your intellectual property.Number 7: Create content.As I do, you must have seena lot of people doing it online,whether on YouTube, or LinkedIn,or Twitter, or Instagram.If you become a content creator,then you unlock multiple income streams.For example, the basic income streamon YouTube is ad revenue.If you allow ads on your channel,then for every thousand views,you get a percentage of the moneythat Google/YouTube makes from it,and as soon as you make $100 as income,you start getting $100 in chequeor through bank transfer.You can do brand collaborations whereyou endorse brands through your content.I often talk about INDmoney, Smallcase,Udemy, and LeverageEdu,because these are brands that work with meand I work with them to ensurethat all these brands get visibility,which I believe becauseI personally use these products.When you unlock that, you unlock moneyas a content creator.Number 8: Create apps.Small apps that won't be too big,you don't have to make them like Twitteror Instagram or WhatsApp,just solve a small use-case,and then you flip these apps on siteslike microacquire.com.So these apps might be doing somevery small things, for example,one app that I knew just reminded peopleto drink water during the day.That's it!This is the only work of the app.So you decide how many liters of wateryou want to drink,how many liters you can drink at one go,then it spreads it out throughoutyour day and sounds an alarm automaticallyfor you to be reminded to drink water.That's it!This is the only work of that app.But due to this, there are so many peoplearound the world who would like touse this app.So assume that 50,000 or 1,00,000downloads have come.And then you flip this appand list it on microacquire.And someone would like to buy it,because they feel that they can dosomething else with this distribution.So they buy it from you for,I don't know, $500, $1,000, $5,000,$10,000, depending on the size and scale,and you make good money for doingsomething that you are good at.And finally number 9:Make SEO websites and monetize them.If you make SEO websites,then for a specific search queryyou do on Google,your site should be highly ranked.And if this works out for you,which happens through SEO,or Search Engine Optimisation,then you can generate money throughselling ads on that website,selling leads on that website,and plenty more.For example, you made an SEO websitefor let's say, education,and specifically for MBA.If anybody searches MBA in India,your site ranks at the top,and there is information on the siteabout business schools.How is ISB School?How is IIM School?How is Warikoo Institute ofManagement School?So some good quality informationthat you have collected,but you don't own it in a way.Then people will come and browse throughthat information because that is valuable.What are the courses?What are the fee structures?How are the reviews if any?How is the faculty? So on and so forth.And you start running ads there.Whose ads will they be?Those business schools that actuallywant these students.They will start promoting themselves,and you will not have to go to thosebusiness schools.Through Google's Adsense platform,you will start displaying these adson your website,and you will start earning money.If you want to take it a step forward,then you can say,I can generate the interest of the studentand make them a lead.So you'll actually say,Are you interested in hearing frombusiness schools that you can apply to?I'll be like,yes.Ok, fill in your details.Name, email, phone number, city,and then you will make that into a lead,and you will actually sell that leadto multiple business schoolswho can contact this studentand inform them about their school.Remember Just Dial used to do this only.If you do not know Just Dial,that's perfectly fine,but that is such a great wayto make money where you startunlocking multiple revenue streamsbasis how good you are in SEOs.So these are the 9 ways for youto make money online,whether you are a school student,a college student, a working professional,a freelancer, or a homemaker,you can get started on all of them.For most of these, you don't needto be technical.Most of them are availableand democratized through the internet,and there is no excuse if you wantto earn extra money for yourselfthat you can't get started on one of them.If you have any 10th or 11th ideasthat I have missed, please tell mein the comment section so thatit's helpful for everyone else.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
