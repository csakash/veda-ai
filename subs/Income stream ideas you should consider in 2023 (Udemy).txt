Passive income number 1:Renting out real estate.A great idea but somethingwhich requires a lot of capital upfront.If you have a shopor a residential apartment or a house,and you rent it outbecause you are not using it,then you start getting a rental income,and that adds to a passive income streambecause you don't have to doanything there.If you want to play in real estatebut you can't invest that kind of money,then REITs are a great way to do that.REITs are big real estate companieswhere you generate a returnthrough their rental income.REITs are Real Estate Investment Trusts.They are listed on the stock marketjust like stocks.There are only three of them in Indiaand all three of themare big real estate companies,so the rental income that they generategives you growth in your investment.So it is a great way to start makingpassive income for as low as â¹500which is the minimum amountyou need to spend to buy a REIT.Based on this, passive income ideanumber 2:Renting out equipment.If you don't have real estate to rent out,then you can rent out the things you own.It could be your cycle, your camera,your technical goods,or anything that you believe people need,but you don't need as much,or you don't use it as actively,so you rent it out.For example, I'm a photography enthusiast.So whenever I go for a wildlife safari,I need big lenses,and I don't want to buy those lensesworth â¹4-6 lakhs,so I actually rent them outfrom photography storesthat have these lenses,they maintain them,and they would give it to me for nothingas compared to the actual priceof the lens.I would be using them for about4-5 days a year,I get the benefit and they do as well,so if you have any such equipment,then you can rent it out as well.Rental income idea number 3:Using AI to generate an income.This is explosive for 2023,especially if you want to go fora content writing job.Content writing isa very active profession.You have to think and write,but with AI, with tools like chat GPT,you can just ask them a question,and they will give you everythingthat you need to know to becomean AI expert or a content writer.So content writing jobs in 2023are actually a passive income stream,if you use AI to smartly becomea content writer.Based on this, passive income ideanumber 4:Homework help.Homework help is a great way to earnside income but it is active income.You have to spend hours,you have to understand the questionand then explain it,but what if AI couldunderstand the problemand give you the solution,then you will spend your timein only explaining to the student,and that saves a lot of your timemaking it into a passive income stream.So if you use AI to solvea homework problem,and then explain the solutionto the student,you save more than half of your time,and you earn as much money,if not more.To understand both of these AI approaches,there are great courses on Udemywhich is the sponsor of this video,because it has the best coursesavailable by world-class instructorson every topic possible.For example, you can see,ChatGPT Masterclass:A Complete ChatGPT Guide for Beginners.If you have no idea what ChatGPT is,which is incidentallythe fastest software ever producedto reach 1 million users in just 5 days,this is a course you want to pick up.This course is only for 6 hours,it is on demand,it has attractive pricing,it is taught by Lance Junckwho is a ChatGPT instructor and AI wizard.You can see its ratings, 4.6,highly rated, 485 ratings already.There are 4,264 studentswho have taken this course already,so this is a great start.If you want to understand AI in general,then I will highly recommend 2 coursesthat are taught by a bunch of instructorswho are terrific and world-classin their field.Hadelin, Kirill, Luka, Jordan,all of them are cyber security experts,data scientists, AI experts,and they have taughtthousands of students.So one of the best-selling courses is,Artificial Intelligence A-Z:Learn How To Build An AI.So you can actually go deep into it.Already around 2 lakh studentshave taken this course.It is 4.4 rated which is very high.Again a similar course is,Machine Learning A-Z:Python & R in Data Science 2023.Machine learning is the best wayfor you to understand how AI works,and Python and R are the two languageson which a lot of machine learninghappens.By the same instructors,and they are terrific in what they do.As you can see, almost 10 lakh studentshave taken this course,and it is still rated 4.5which is a brilliant rating.So highly recommend these 3 coursesto get started on your AI journeywhen it comes to passive income.Number 5: Investing in index funds.What are index funds?Index funds track a group of stocksthat are meant to have a certain objective.For example, the Nifty 50 index fundtracks India's top 50 stocks.How are they moving?How is their weightage changing?You don't need to worry about that.If you invest in the Nifty 50 index,then your money will performaccording to the performanceof the top 50 companies.It is the best way to earn passive incomebut over a long period of time.If you do it for 1-2 years only,may not be the right investment to make.But if you invest for 3-5 years or more,and then every year your moneyis growing in a good fashion,then an index mutual fundis a good way to invest.Based on this, if you can takeslightly more risk,then besides the top 50 companies,you can invest in the top 100 mid-capcompanies which is calledthe Midcap 100 index.These companies are between7 to 20,000 crore market cap,they are top 100, so they wouldalso keep moving.But why are they riskier?Because in comparison tothe top 50 companies,these companies experiencemore fluctuation,so you will understand thatthese are smaller companies,so in case of any economic changes,like a recession,increase in inflation rates,so on and so forth,they get more impacted,but over a long period of time,they generate better results and returns.And if you are ready to takeeven more risk,then you can also invest inthe small-cap index fund,which are the smallest companies out therelisted on the stock exchange.A good portfolio is when you haveâ¹100 to invest,and you want to generate a passive income,then my suggestion is to invest 60%in a Nifty 50 index,25% in a midcap 100 index,then 15% in a small cap index fund,and because of these,you can properly manage your risk,grow your money,and over a long period of time,you will be surprised athow much passive income you will generate.It is easy to understand the stock marketbut it needs hard work.If you need courses for this,then Udemy again has a bunchof really high-quality courses,most of which I've already consumed.This is a great course.The Complete FoundationStock Trading Course.It is it trading course,not an investment course,but this requires you to beslightly more active,in fact, a lot more active,but what I like about this courseis that it teaches you technical analysisand candlesticks efficiently,in addition to day trading.It is conducted or run by a guycalled Mohsen Hassanwho is considered to beone of the best instructors out therefor stock trading, and do check that out.Then,Technical Analysis MasterClass.I took this course almost 4-5 years back.More than 1 lakh studentshave taken this course.Jyoti Bansal who is a qualifiedinvestment advisor teaches this course,and she is really good with it.Her fundamentals are really strong,and I thoroughly enjoyed this coursewhen I took it.And then,Stock Trading & Investingfor Beginners 4-in-1 Course Bundle.This is a great course thatI will highly recommendfor all beginners who have no ideahow to start investing.You will see that it isa highly-rated course.There are more than 5,000 ratings.More than 34,000 studentshave taken this course.It has a 4.6 rating,and it is only for 9 hours.So within 9 hours,you will get everythingthat you want to learn as a beginner.All of these links are therein the description and the pinned comment,so you can click on themand buy these courses,and not just that,if you buy these coursesthrough these links,I earn an affiliate incomeand 100% of that goes towardsthe education of kidswho cannot afford it.In Jan-December of 2022,we contributed â¹60 lakhs towardsthe education of 123 kids.All thanks to you!God bless you all!Number 6:A very interesting way to generatepassive income is calledthe reverse passive income.You are not generating an income actively,but wherever your expenses are,by observing them very closely,you try to reduce those expenses.For example, you save on loan refinancing.You have a loan going on somewhere,but you can get that loanfrom some other bank cheaperand at a lower interest rate,without any additional cost, foreclosure,or anything, so you will move there.Your credit card payment is due,you are unable to pay in full,but they will say,convert it into a low interestthan what you pay 35-40%,so you will do that, and save money there.You have taken a subscription,and there is a new offeron that subscriptionthat will help you save moneyover a long period of time,then you will opt for that.This means that you are not generatingany income actively,but every expense of yours is lookedat closely and you tryand save money through that.Always a smart way of thinkingabout your expenses.Number 7:Create a course.I run multiple courses,you also can run many courses.It doesn't matter how young you are,what you know or don't.The main benefit of courses is curation.There is a lot of contentaround the world,and students need only one thingthat someone should scan that content,and curate it to makea well-designed curriculum.Whether it is stock trading,or how to work on YouTube,or how to write,or how to publish a book,or something about CBSE,or whatever the case maybe,if you know somethingwhich you think you're good at,you can teach it well to people,then create a course,because once you create that course,it will go on for life.That course with sell evenwhile you are sleepingand make money for you.Number 8:Build an app.If you know how to codeor even if you don't,but you know a coderwho can build an app for you,then build an app,because after building an appand releasing it,if you do a good job ofspreading the word around,and that app actually helps peopleand is beneficial to them,it will start spreading,and you will make passive incomefrom that.A great example is an app thatI started almost 2-2.5 years backwith a very dear friend of mine Akshay,and that app was around sleep.Sleep is very important.I think sleep is very important,and I think a lot of people aren't ableto sleep properly.So we created an app thathelped people sleep.Whether it is sleep soundsor sleep stories or sleep meditation,and its focus was UK and US,because we felt that this problemof sleep was very prevalent there,and it actually did really well.More than a million downloadsover the last 2 years happened,and it still continues to run.And all of that was passivein the sense that we used to spenda few hours a week on it collectively,and yet it was something thatstarted making money throughadvertising and subscriptions,and made a brilliantpassive income stream.Number 9:Publish ebooks.If you cannot create a coursebecause you don't want to record a videoor you don't have that much contentto fill in those hours,then publish an ebook.There are so many examples of peoplewho have created good quality ebooksand sell it for a dollaror â¹29 or â¹45 or â¹50,but because it sells in thousands,you start making that money.And the best thing is that nowthat ebook is out in the universe,so it will keep selling evenwhile you are sleeping, bathing,eating, whatever the case may be,making you this passive income stream.So if you know something thatthe world wants to know,and you can organize that informationin an ebook, please publish that,and make this passive income streamcome live.Number 10:If you are a photographeror even if you aren't,phone has made it possible for everyone,then you can sell yourhigh-quality photographson a stock images site.There are multiple sites out therethat need high-quality photographs.Photographs that are very specificand very contextual.For example, there are very fewIndias specific photographs,they are very difficult to find.If you go on Google searchand ask for a family eating dinner,then usually you will seeAmerican or white people,but you will never see Indian people.People of our skin, our tonality,and our environment,so there is a need fora lot of India-specific photographs,and if you love clicking,and if you find yourselfjoyfully clicking good photographs,then please list them ona stock images site.Whenever it would sell,you would make money,and you wouldn't have to activelyspend time on it.Number 11:Affiliate marketing.Something that I have benefited froma lot,and because of that,a lot of students have.Affiliate marketing meanswhen you tie up with a brand,and promote its productsor services through links.If people click on those linksand buy something,then you get a percentageof the revenue generated.I earned â¹60 lakhs last yearthrough my affiliate income,and what I had promisedwhen I started affiliate marketingis 100% of that income will go towardsthe education of kidswho can't afford it themselves.So last year,from January to December 2022,â¹60 lakhs was contributed towardsthe education of 123 kids.All thanks to you because you clickedon those links, bought something,and that's how that income was generated.You can do this for yourself as well,you don't have to donate it to anybody.If you have a network of yourschool friends, college friends,or office friends,or if you are a part of a networkof your colony or anywhere else,then you can sign up with brands,ask for an affiliate link,and the promotion of that linkwill then help you make passive income.Brilliant!Number 12:It still works.Domain names and flipping them.Flipping means buying domain names,and since they are very excitingor contextual or trendy at that moment,selling them quickly.And this is a great way to make money.It used to be very active earlier,but now of course it seems domain nameshave receded, because peoplego for apps mostly,but they are still not dead.There are so many premium domain namesthat people are ready to buy.My education company Webveda,its domain name webveda.com,I bought it 2 years back for â¹2.5 lakhs.That is something that I wanted tobecause I wanted that domain for myself.I remember almost 10 years back,not even 10, almost 15-20 years back,dot in domain extension was launched,and I booked Indiavotes.in.I cannot disclose who I sold it to,but whoever I sold it to,I sold it for â¹1 lakh,and this was almost 10-15 years back,in fact, 15-20 years back,and that just made happy money for me.So if you get a domain namethat is very unique, very popular,and you think it can matcha trend or a context,then buy that domain name for cheap,and then sell it for a higher amountlater on.Number 13:Drop shipment.Drop shipment is very commonand very actively used bya lot of young people.Drop shipment means you will listyour product on a website like Amazon.Amazon has two modes,one is where they own the productsthemselves and they ship it to you,or they operate in a marketplace modelthrough drop shippers, which meansif you buy a product as a customer,then Amazon will send that orderto the owner,and ask them to do the shipment directlyto the customer.So you will get that order,you will pack the product,and you will ship it.It's active in the sense thatyou will have to do the packagingand the shipment,but if you employ people for that,then it becomes a great sourceof passive income,where you can promote anything.It could be men's fashion,could be women's fashion,could be home utensils,could be stationary,could be books,whatever is it that you have access to,but then you will be able to sell iteven while sleeping.Number 14:If you have a parking space,then you can rent it out.Parking space is usually becomingvery expensive and rare in big cities.Even in our colony,there is no more parking.If you want to buy parking,it is not availablefor any amount of money.But it is available for rent.â¹7,000 a month to park a car,which means almost an expense of a lakhfor a year for a single car parking,and this is on top of the costof the car itself.So it is expensive to own a car,but if you have a parking space,or if you have a space that cannotbecome a shop or a hotel or a house,but can get convertedinto a parking space,then that could be a smart wayfor you to do it,and do it legally,of course, don't do it illegally,but if you can create a parking space,then please do it and rent it out.Passive income at its best.Number 15:If you create content on social mediaand you have a lot of followers,then you can generate a passive incomethrough a sponsored post,where you will just create that contentand you will get paid for creatingthat content.I do it actively with a lot of brandswhere I collaborate with them,and I help them get to it.For example, this video is sponsoredby Udemy,so this is a collaborative postwhere I am endorsing Udemy,because I love their productsand their services,and they have of course paid mefor doing the same thing.In the same way,if you have a social media following,and you love the content that you create,then you can help brands reach outto your audience as well.Number 16:If you love writing then you can createa newsletter,and generate a passive incomethrough that newsletter.If there are enough peoplewho are following your newsletter,then you can monetize that audiencethrough brand collaborations,through affiliate links,through insertment,or selling of products and serviceswhich you want to sell yourself,anything goes till you havethe email address and the attentionof people,you have the ability to monetize itbeautifully and passively.Number 17:Sell merchandise online.If you are a designer,if you are a product creator,if you like to create things,then you can actually create productsand sell those online,or you can create designsand sell them online.There are many websites that support this.What is needed is for you to create that,and to be able to sell iteither on your own destination,or preferably a marketplace,where you don't have to createthe whole infrastructure,you only have to list your products,and then you sell,and make happy money.Number 18:Cloud kitchens.Zomato, Swiggy,we are constantly ordering from them,but cloud kitchens area very interesting modelwhere you don't build a restaurant,you don't pay a lot of rental fora fancy place, and so on.You build a kitchen in a backyard,in a non-fancy place,where only food is cooked,and that restaurant of yourswhere nobody comes,but food is only delivered from there,you list it on Zomato and Swiggy,and then you start makinga passive income stream.So you need a chef, a place,and some people who can produceand pack that food,what you have to do is just trackthe orders,and you have a nice happy business set up.Number 19:Dividend stocks.The stocks which don't growa lot in their price,but release yearly dividends.What are dividends?Whenever a company makes a profit,there can be two ways to use that profit.Either to put that money back intothe business so that the companykeeps growing,or if the company feels thatits best use is not to put it backin the business,but to distribute itto the company's shareholders,then that is called a dividend,which is to distribute the profitamongst the shareholders.So if you are an owner of that stock,then without selling that stockyou will get a dividend,which is a nice happy passive incomefor owning the stock.I made a specific video on dividend stockswhich you can check out to help youunderstand how they work.Number 20:Corporate bonds.I really hate fixed deposits becausethey don't even beat inflation.But if you love fixed returns,then you can evaluate corporate bonds.Corporate bonds are loans in a waybut a company asks for it from people.So banks give them the loan,but people like us can also givethem the loan, and through that,we earn a fixed rate of return.It is quite risky, because God forbid,if something happens to the company,then all the money can be lost,that's why it is very very importantthat whenever you buy a corporate bond,it should be highly rated.It should be a AAA or a AA cooperate bond.A good destination to buy corporate bondsis WintWealth.Disclosure: I'm an investor in WintWealth,so I am giving a biased opinion,but I buy my corporate bondsfrom WintWealth only.You can check out elsewhereand go for it as well.Number 21:Gold loans.If you have a lot of gold,and you don't usually use it,maybe it's not in the form of jewelry,or anything else,then you can loan out that gold,so that you start earning interest on that.This is a great way to deploythe excess gold that is therein almost every Indian household,and through this,you can generate a passive income streamthrough something that you ownbut don't use.Number 22:P2P lending.It is very risky,so I will try to explain it in detail.Basically, you give a loan tosomeone because you have money,and that person returns the moneyto you but with an interest.You can do P2P with your friends,but I will not suggest it,because if that friend says,What is money in friendship!You are my brother!Then you may never get that money back.And the right way to do thatis through platforms.So there are many platformswhere you can do P2P lending.Not something that I would personallyrecommend because it is very risky,but if you really care about puttingyour money in and earninga happy rate of return,then you can explore that.Do it at your own risk.And number 23:Finally, the best way to earna passive income is to continueinvesting in yourself.You are the best investment for yourself.If you invest in your education,your growth, your experiences,your failures,you will continue to make incomewhichever is possible.So the 22 ways that I spoke of earlier,you will be able to do all of themin a snap if you focus on the 23rd method.So whatever happens in 2023,we will invest the most in ourselves,because that will ensure thatwe have the best way to generatea passive income,not just, now but forever.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
