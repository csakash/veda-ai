Aditya, this is yourweekly surprise video.We have to give it a name.Let's call it the Lit video, yeah?The sick video, the Lit video.Let's call it the Lit video.So this is your weekly Lit video.I want this to be fast-paced.I want this to be like the NFT thing,because I will covera bit of history in this,and then I will go to the present,and the future,so take it for what it is.Lots of clips, newspaper clippings,pick up something from other videosbecause I will be talkingabout the dot-com crash,the energy international crisis,and so on.So make that happen,ok, cool, let's get started.There is no start,we'll go straight into it.In the year 2000,there was a dot-com bust!I wasn't investingat that point in time,so I don't know what wasthe actual implication ofthat dot-com bust.I invest now, and graduallyI can understand what wouldhave happened at that time.For the first time in my life,I am sitting on a stock that is80% down in its value.And this is not some penny stock,some random stock,this is a very well-recognized company,a great tech company,but I am 80% down.And I want to talk to youabout what that means,not just for now,but for the future.Because I believe, that this momentthat we are going through,particularly in global markets,is once in a lifetime opportunityto become smart about your money.Because if you take that action now,which a lot of people are hesitatingto take, you may emerge far smarter,far wealthier than all of us.Look at this graph.This is the graph ofthe Nasdaq Composite index,which is the predominantstock exchange index in the US.And with the red arrows,I have marked all those times,when this Nasdaq index took a beating.In the year 2000,during the dot-com bust,the market crashed by nearly 80-90%.2007-2008, when there wasa financial crisis.The downfall of real estatein the US,and because of that Lehman brothers,and so many other companies went bust.In the year 2016,there was a small blip,largely around Sas Tech,which gave a slight impact.In the year 2019, just before covid,there was another pressurebecause of everythingthat was happening in the world.I don't know much about it,and that's why I madea random statement.In the year 2020, covid happened,and the market went througha period of uncertaintybefore going through massive gains.And now again in 2022,a downfall is coming.All these periods are verywell documented,but many of you must havenot invested your moneyduring these periods,so you don't really knowwhat happened.In fact, I recently dida poll on YouTube.Aditya, go back tothe community post,I did a poll there.In this poll, I asked people,When did you activelystart investing?We have 21,000 votes,so we can show the poll.In fact, I recently askedall of you on YouTube,When did you activelystart investing?And you will see that 32% of youhave started investing onlyin the last one year.Around 12% of youin the last two years.And 45% of you havenot even started investing.I am assuming that's becauseyou are not earning,and that's perfectly fine.But close to 50% of youhave been investingin the last two years.And what happenedin the last two years?This period has comein the last two years.This entire period of gainfrom 2020's crash of covidto the peak at the end of 2021is what you have witnessed.So you have no idea whatthis downfall means.And this will affect you,it will disturb you,it will make you very nervous,very anxious,but it is important for you to recognizewhy this period can be the periodof the greatest opportunity.First, let's get to knowwhat's happening in the market.The Tech stocks in the USare taking a beating.The stocks of most Tech companiesare massively down.Why?Largely 3 reasons.One, the Russia-Ukraine war,because of which there isan energy crisis all acrossthe world,and that is creating someripple effect.Two, due to the supply issues in China,the supply of semiconductor chipsto a lot of tech indusrtiesin the world has stopped.And then number three,in the last 2 yearsbecause of covid,particularly the US governmenthas printed large amountsof dollars, because of whichthere is massive liquidity.So strangely what's happeningis that the world is goingthrough what is calledStagflation.A moment when there is notas much growth becausethere is a shortage of supply,there are not many jobs,the income is less,but since there isa lot of liquidity,inflation is high.The US has recordedits highest inflationin decades, and that iscreating an economic condition,where the growth is notso much but inflationis really high.Things are becoming expensivebut your income isnot increasing at that pace.And that is a verytroubling period,especially because the Tech stocksare not yet profitable.Since inflation goes up,to counter it, mostly the governmentincreases the interest rate,and when the interest rate increases,then the value of money startsdepreciating overa period of time.The value of money in the futurewill be very less as againstthe value of money today.Today's $1, will not beone dollar in the future,it would be quite less.And the rate at whichit is depreciatingor losing its value is fasterif the interest rates are high.All of these things aremaking Tech stocks takea beating.But as I said, this couldbe a moment of opportunity.And for that, you have tolook at history because historyalways has lessons for all of us.To give you a sense,let me show you what Amazonfelt like in all these yearsof existence.Around the year 2000,Amazon's stock was $100.And then after that,it went through a beating,and it went down by 90%of its value.You can look at that graph,and see how much its value reduced,and imagine being an investorof Amazon, you bought the shareat $100, and in today's date,it's selling for $10.And it took, what almost,I am going on and on and onto see where it stopped.It took almost 7 yearsto get back to that same number.But when it reached,because this was a timefor Amazon to make investments,for it to continue doingwhatever it had to do,and it had to recover a lot.After that, it started rising,and thenthere was no looking back.Because at that point,how much ever down you may go,you will always remain higherthan your original price.So all those who believedin the opportunity,and continued to buy stocksof Amazon during this periodof 2000-2007,are now millionaires.They made the best bet,the best investment of their life.Now we don't know whattheir next Amazon is.We don't know whetherwe should buy the stocksof Amazon now or not,so that after 7 years,when it comes back to that price,it will move faster and so on.We don't know whetherwe should do it forsome other stock.Let's look at some other stock,one of my favorite stocks.Google.Google, same.Around 2007, it was foraround $316, and thenthe subprime crisis happened,and it went down by 55% or so.55%!Half the value of the stock was gone.And at this point,when it was for $142,it took almost three more yearsto come back to the original pricewhich it had in 2007.But when that happened, after that...It struck a jackpot!Investment after investment!Huge returns!So all those who were buyingGoogle stocks between 2007-2010,are now millionaires.They don't have to ever earn again.That's what I think could bethe opportunity for all of us.Today, when the whole worldis scared of investingin the US market,I am investing regularly,because I know in the next 2-3 years,this market is going to tank,and it will take its timeto recover, if I am ableto make the right investments,I will make more moneyin the next 10 years to follow,than any other investmentthat I would make.This is just my belief,and that's what I am doingright now.But there is one thing commonbetween both of us.I don't know which stocks to buy.I am not an expert.I cannot do the research,fundamental analysis,or technical analysis,that the experts can do,so I always rely on indexes.And in this case, indexesare really powerful,because they then optimizefor the good and the badand keep giving youconsistent returns.Yes, an index would give youa lesser return froma particular stock,but that would be still better,because the risk-adjustedreturn would be good.I don't know which stock to pick,so by picking any one stock,I would be taking a very high risk.But when I invest in an index,which is a portfolio of stocks,then my risk is being mitigatedwhile still giving me reasonablyhigh returns.What could be an index for this?Personally, I have investedin two indexes.One, QQQ.And second, VOO.QQQ is more interesting for mebecause it is a tech-focused index.48% or so of its currentinvestments are in standardTech companies.Amazon, Google, Facebook,Tesla, so on and so forth,that is what I want to build,because right now, all thesestocks are going througha correction,and if I keep accumulatingover the next 2-3 years,I know I would have gatheredthem at a brilliant price,so that the return ofthe next 10 years willconsistently beat anyother stable return.This is QQQ.It is listed on the Nasdaq.It is the InvescoQQQ Trust Series 1.This is its return over5 years which is 119%.This means your moneydoubled up in 5 years.This is after the correctionthat has happened recently,which is almost close to 22%.If you will look at the peakin the 5 years, then it was 188%.This means your moneyhad almost tripled,then it went through a 22%correction to bring itto almost doubling up.But still, a lot of manifoldsin just 5 years.If you do a proper researchon QQQ, then you will realizethat its constituentsare mostly US Tech stocks.I use INDmoney to make allmy tech stocks investments.Let me go to INDmoney.When you see it on INDmoney,it will give you allthe details about QQQ.For instance, if you hadinvested â¹5 lakhs,then within 3 yearsthose â¹5 lakhs would havebecome â¹9.5 lakhs.If you had invested in SNP,which is the 500 top stocksin the US, they would bearound â¹8.5 lakhs.If you have invested in Nifty 50,which are the top 50 stocksof India onthe National Stock Exchange,they would be around â¹7 lakhs.It will also tell you,what are the constituents.If you look at the top 10 holdings,then clearly, it is tech-heavy.Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,Meta which is Facebook,NetFlix, blah blah blah.And if you look at the sector,then you will see that technologyis 48% which is whatI reasonably want.The second big thingwhich has happened,and that is criticalfor this approach isa regular disciplinedinvestment approach, SIPs.SIPs are far betterthan lump sums at this point,because you don't knowhow much the market will tank,so you don't want to betiming the market,I would never recommendthat because I can't dothat personally.What you have to do isregularly keep investing in a SIP.INDmoney has recentlylaunched a SIP.You can see on the screen,how it works.It is very very simple.You pass a mandate to your bank,and every month that moneyis easily deducted,and it goes into the investments,and everything isclean and clear.At all points in time,your investments throughINDmoney are absolutely free,you will not be chargedany money to transfer moneyfrom India to the US.They give the best exchange rates.Everything is safe and secure.All your investmentsare with a safeand trusted authority,they are not with INDmoney.All of these processesare orated by a third party,independent observer,so it is at least mypreferable way of investingin the US stock market,which I would recommendto all of you as well.Because of this,an amazing giveaway.If you want to startyour US stock investing journeythrough INDmoney, then usingmy link which is therein the pinned commentand the description below,you can get a free stock of Google.How do you have to do it?Just click on the linkthat is there inthe pinned commentand the description.When you make yourfirst transaction through that,you get a Google stockabsolutely free.This is just somethingthat is coming from me to youthrough courtesy INDmoney.Another index that I really likeis VOO or Vanguard 500 Index Fund.It is an ETF that is equivalentto a mutual fund in the US.And what it does is, it investsin the top 500 companiesof the US as againsta selection of companieswhich is done by QQQ.So if you want an averageout return, then this would bea good one to go after.If you look here,in the last 5 years,it has given 68%,so lesser than QQQ,but still pretty good,because if you have gotan absolute return of 68%in 5 years,that is still not bad.This is after havinggone through a crashwhich is almost 15%in the last few months.If you look at this,this is again a great wayfor you to start yourUS Stock investing journey.The third and amazing partof the US stock investingjourney is that youalso benefit from theexchange rate betweenthe US dollar and the Indian rupee.Unfortunately, and I willsay unfortunatelybecause as an IndianI wouldn't want that,but the Rupee depreciatesin value over time ascompared to the US dollar.This means if you wantto invest â¹1 lakh today,and you convert it in US dollars,then it would convertat the rate of around â¹75-76.If you would have donethe same thing 10 years ago,then your â¹1 lakh would beconverted at the rate ofaround â¹50-55.So the amount of dollarsthat you would get would increase.And this growth rate ishappening in terms of dollars,which is 68% for VOO,116-118% for QQQ,and when you convert backthat money to the Indian rupeeduring that period of time,which could be 5 years,10 years, whatever,the Rupee would havedepreciated more,so your dollars wouldmake more rupees.So you will not just gainfrom the capital appreciationof the stocks orthe US Stock Market,you will also gain fromthe depreciation ofthe Indian rupee.Not something thatI would wish but sinceit is a reality,I would at least want usas smart investorsto benefit from it.Ultimately, remember thatthe best use of yourIndian rupees is to investin the Indian stock market,which will continue to bethe highest, hopefully the highest,or one of the fastest-growingcountries in the world forthe next 10-20 years,and the US stock marketwhich will continue to decisivelybe the biggest stock marketin the world,where the biggest companieswill reside.When you have the powerof these two,you actually are creatingone of the strongest portfoliosthat you can for the next 10-20 years.It is not a short-term approach.It is not a way tomake money overnight.This is the way that you makeabsolutely smart dollars,using the benefit of historythat I just showed you,and the understanding ofthe present to make surethat you have a kickass future.Ankur
