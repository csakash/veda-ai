If you would have startedyour investing 2 years back,how much money would you have made,we will get to know in this video.Friends, I released my most powerful videoon 19th January 2021, and that wasHow to invest in your 20s?If you haven't watched that video,please check it out.The world has changed a lot since then,but the foundation of that videois still intact,because the fundamentalsof investing don't change.So in a conversation with my team,we discussed that if we had shotthat video in January 2021,and people would have started investingafter watching that,whether their first investmentor investing in a disciplined manner,so today depending onwhere they had invested their money,what would be their returns?And I would try to answer this questionin this video.If you would have invested your moneyin different asset classes,and you would have started yourinvesting journey on 19th January 2021,then what would be your returns?We will touch almost all asset classesexcept real estate, because usually,real estate requires a huge quantum,but besides that,all the other asset classesor any other medium of investmentis available for all of us.So, let's start first of all withour parents' favorite,fixed deposit!FDs are a foundation of our country,because FDs provide stability, security,but it also damages us,because inflation is increasing rapidly,and things are becoming expensive,so the value of your money is decreasing.If you took an FD on 19th January 2021for 2 years, then in August 2022,your money would have grown by how much,let's try to find that.For that, I went to the site of SBI,which is the largest bank in the country,and I tried to look forthe rates of FD there.This is available on the site of SBI,historical returns of fixed deposit,and we are interested to get an FDfor 2 years, 1-2 years,because it's been around18 months till now,so 1 year to less than 2 years.Let's assume, we have taken an FDfor 2 years, ok?So 2 years to less than 3 years,and we want to go to 2021.5.1%!5%, even lesser than inflation.So if you had a fixed deposit,you would have got 5.1% annually.This is the rate of return foryour fixed deposit.There is no price here.Now you say, ok, you have an FD,but you had also invested in a PPF,Public Provident Fund, which again hasa fixed rate of return,much more than a fixed deposit,but there is a lock-in of 15 years,so your money is there for 15 years,but if you had got that too,from 1st April 2020 to 31st March 2022,the return is 7.1%.The good thing is that this returnis tax free, which is great!So tax-free return...Actually, let's show the tax also.So, the tax would be income tax,and here it would be no tax.Great!Then some people would say,we have invested in gold becausegold can be worn, we can be Bappi Lahiri,so let's invest in gold.Let's see the performance of gold.This is a chart for gold,and we are looking at the last 5 years.We will go near 19th January,let's look at 22nd January,the rate of gold was â¹50,825,and today it is â¹53,480.What just happened?!Sorry.Ok.The rate of gold today is â¹53,480,because of which we would get 3.4%,and you will have to give Income Taxon this also,so the absolute return would be 5.2%.Ok?So if you would have invested â¹100in gold on 19th January 2021,they would be â¹105 today,which gives you an annual return of 3.5%!Worse, if people would have boughtjewelry instead of gold!There would be making charges on jewelry,these charges, those charges,charges for tea, charges for Coca-Cola,charges for biscuits,if we add all these, even 3.5% be gone!That's what I think!Some people were smart and they said,'Ankur Warikoo is old, keeps blabbering,but maybe he makes sense.He focuses a lot on equities,he asks to take risksif you are in your 20s, why play safe?Because God forbid,even if something happens,there is a lot of time to recover it,but if compounding gets an optionon an opportunity,then compounding can change everythingfor you in 10-20-30 years,that's why I listened to himand opted for the safest equity option,by safe I mean relatively safe,Nifty 50, we investedin the top 50 stocks of India,in Reliance, Tata, Wipro, Infosys,HDFC Bank, SBI, all of these,so they don't grow rapidly,but they are stable stocks.Since its equity, the better they perform,the more would be their value,so we invested in Nifty 50.'Let's see where was Nifty 50on 19th January 2021,let's consider 22nd January,it was at â¹14,371.And today, Nifty 50,on 5th August or 8th August,it's at â¹17,525.This means a total return of 22%and an annual return of 13.3%,meaning if you had investedâ¹100 in Nifty 50 on 19th January 2021,then today they would be â¹122.That is the simplest way to do it.Of course, your moneywould increase accordingly,but there would bea lot of fluctuation too.The stock market is getting criticizeda lot these days, it has tanked,people have stopped making videoson investing,people don't look at thiszoomed-out picture thatwhere did we start and where are we now!Yes, there would be fluctuations,it's in life as well,but you don't stop because of that,so it's the same way, you will not stopinvesting because of this.Now, some other people weremore risk-loving, and they said,'Nifty 50 is ok, but we have heardthat midcap is a very interesting thing,there we don't invest in the top 50,but in the companies valued atâ¹5,000-20,000 crores,the top 100 companies in that section,they are called Mid-Cap, mid meansthe companies in the middleof market capitalization,that's where we would invest.'This is an indexwhich means Nifty,which is the National Stock Exchange,has created a proper indexof the top 100 Mid-Cap companies,and here is its chart.Let's look at its 5-year chart,and let's see its positionon 19th January.Ok, here's 19th January,its value was â¹21,157,and today, 8th August,30,000, sorry...and today, 5th August,it's â¹30,304, wow!Absolute return of 43%, which means â¹100will become â¹143 at an annual rate of 24%.Wow!Some people were even more risk-loving,they said,We will be more daring, we will gointo small-cap instead of mid-cap.These companies have a value ofless than â¹5,000 crores,and their top 100 companieswill be picked up,which is again an index of Niftycalled the Nifty smallcap 100,now we will invest in that.'Let's see its 5-year chart.Here is 19th January, sorry,let's consider 20 January, oops sorry!I guess I made a mistake.Just a minute.So, let's see how it was on 19th January,here it is, on 19th January,it was â¹7,337.And if we look at it todaywhich is around 8th August,it is â¹9,349, which is 27%.If you would have invested â¹100,you would have got â¹127.Some people would say,'We would not take that much risk,because we don't know much aboutsmall-cap and mid-cap,we will go for multi-cap.The top 500 companies of Nifty,where broadly 50% are large-cap companies,30% are mid-cap companies,and 20% are small-cap companies.'So let's look at the Nifty 500,and here it is.On 19th January 2021,it was approximately â¹11,503,and today, it is â¹14,890,which comes to around 17% annual return,and 29% absolute return,so your â¹100 would be â¹129.And if we had invested this moneyin the US Stock Market,which is something thatI have also spoken about,to invest in the US becauseit is the largest market in the world,it is a global market.So S&P500 is the stock index for the US.Let's see, how was it onthe 19th of January 2021?It was at 3,841,and today it is at 4,145,which is a 5% return,the market is already hammered,but this is something that there is.And then finally, I want to talkabout Bitcoin alsobecause I focused on crypto as well.Again, your investment should not bemore than 5-10% on crypto,it is highly highly highly risky,very volatile, but if you believein crypto, you understand it,then you can allocate 5-10% to it.Let's look at the price of Bitcoin,since crypto doesn't have any index,let's see how it was on 19th January,let's look at 22nd January,23,44,317, this is in lakhs,and today the price is 19,15,311,which is negative 13% annually,and negative 18% at an absolute.And if we see the absolutefor this fixed deposit.Let's make this fixed depositand PPF to annualso that we get an approximation,and this is how it would have performed.If you had watched that video of19th January 2021 and started investing,and invested in all these asset classes,then these would be your returns.If you would have investedin a fixed deposit, then 7.65%,which means â¹100 would become â¹107-108.In PPF, â¹100 would become around â¹110.In gold, â¹100 would become â¹105.If you would invest in Nifty 50,â¹100 would become â¹122.In mid-cap, â¹100 would become â¹143.In small-cap, â¹100 would become â¹127.In multi-cap, it would be around â¹130.In S&P, which is in the US,â¹100 would become around â¹108.And in Bitcoin,â¹100 would reduce to around â¹80.That is how your investing would've been.This view is for 1.5 years only.Of course, that is very very short.As I say, long-term investing startsshowing at least after 5 years.But this is such a great start.And this is after so much hammeringin the market this year,2022 hasn't been good for any index,but despite that, you are sittingon such great returns,especially in the equity market.I am a believer in the equity space.If you are in your 20s,please keep investing in equities.I didn't complete the income tax.So short-term is 15%,and long-term is 10%.Short-term is 15%, long term is 10%.Bitcoin is not there, so it ison Income Tax only.And S&P, international is,I think...And in the US,the short-term is income tax,and long-term is 20%.But the difference here is thatthe definition of short termin the US is 2 years,but short-term in India is 1 year only,which means investing in the UStends to be more expensive froma tax perspective than investingin Indian equities.This is the complete picture.I am not showing this pictureto praise my bang-on prediction,because I did not predict anything,I only suggested a way forhow you can start your investing,but more importantly, hopefully,you will be convincedthrough this that equity,in the long run, is a great allocation.If you believe in crypto,then please invest there.I believe in it, so I am ready to waitfor even 5-10-20 years,because right now that negative returnsdon't seem exciting.But my investment is, 50%,or actually how my entire portfolio is:35% of my entire portfoliois in Indian equities,35% is in US equities, 10% is in crypto,and 20% is in startups,this is my investing split.That is how I am investing right nowat the age of 42.There is no fixed income,I do not have any fixed deposit,actually, I have never had it,I do not have any EPF PPF,I do not invest in gold,I do not invest in real estate,because none of these thingsare either excitingand I don't understand them.I only understand equity,that too index investingor small case investing.And then I invest in the US,particular stocks and index.And I invest in only and onlythree coins in crypto,Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.This is my investing strategy,doesn't need to be yours,but this chart,or this excel should tell you isthat you need to start investingif not already.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
