Number 6: My pot,or actually the entire toilet.This could be the productivespace of every single person, but we destroyed itby number 1:Bringing our phone into this space.In my opinion,and I don't think I'llbe wrong when I say this, people's pot time has doubled or tripledafter the introduction ofsmartphones andinternet connection, because we are just spending time checking our phone, our social mediawhile sitting on the potthinking that we are doing epic shit. I don't take my phone along with me.The most I take withme is my newspaper.It gets over within 10 minutes, but my space, when I am sitting here,when I am showering,when I am even shaving,or brushing,is my zone.Just my thoughts, just myself, and it allows me to plan the day.It allows me to think,âWhat are the things whichare necessary for me?Which are the tasks thatI have to complete today? How will I plan them?â A calendar starts forming in my mind.A calendar is alreadythere on Google calendar.So, those two calendarsstart being compared.And I then get super-centered on what is needed for meto feel productive atthe end of the day. I will give you one tip around this. A lot of people feel if you do a lot of things in a day, you become productive.That's not the wayto think about this.I think of it in completelythe opposite direction.What are those 2-3 taskswhich if I do today,I would feel productiveat the end of the day? And I use this spaceto plan those 2-3 tasks.I hope you do too.
