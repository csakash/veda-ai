Highly recommended!Number 3:Our favorite,Atomic Habits by James Clear.A book that tells youhow even the smallest of habitscan combine togetherand give big results in your life.For example, if you become 1% betterevery day.What does 1% mean?Suppose, you write an essay of 100 wordsevery day.The next day you will writean essay of 101 words.Then the next day you will writean essay of 102 words, so on and so forth.So every day 1%!At the end of the year,you would have grown by 37 times!This means if you wrote100 words in a day,then at the end, you would startwriting 3700 words in a day.That will be the change.Of course, that's not humanly possiblebut what it says is how it works.But there's the opposite also.If you reduce by 1% every day,you are lazy, you say,How does it matter?It's just 1%, it's okay.Then at the end of the year,after that reduction of 1%,it remains at only 3%.Which remains you started with 100,and now you are left with 3.That is the power of atomic habits.Small habits, big results!Great book! Simple book!Number 4:Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl.A brilliant true storyabout Viktor Franklwho was a Jewish prisoner in Nazi Germany,and how he changed his mindsetand changed his life.While being a prisoner,how he changed a prisoner's experienceto a totally different experiencejust with his mindset.It's a brilliant book,a necessary book for everyone,but also a book that everyoneat any age will not understand.There's a certain age and momentwhen this book clicks,which is why I said thatthese 15 books may not work for everyone,but may at some point in time,so I would love for you to get startedon this journey.Number 5:The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.An extremely brilliant book thattells how precious is the present moment.We cannot change our past.We are always anxious, doubtful,and uncertain about our future.But only one moment is the most important,which is now!How are we living our livesand what are we thinking in this momentbecomes the most important thing.Tomorrow may or may not happen,and we cannot changewhat has already happened.Great book!As I said,you get these 15 books for free.How?You have to click on the link givenin the pinned comment and

or not,it's a beautiful talk.It is one of the highest-watchedTed Talks.Search for Brene Brown vulnerabilityon Google and her Ted Talk will pop up.Absolutely unbelievable talk!And this talk changed Brene Brown'slife because she is a researcher on this.She has devoted her life tovulnerability, shame, and failurein terms of research,and her book was releasedDaring Greatly, which was a brilliant bookwhen I read it.Highly highly recommended!Number 7:Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can MatterMore Than IQ by Daniel Goleman.Emotional Intelligencehas become very important,because we already know that IQas a raw horsepower is very important,but emotional intelligence,how you treat people,how you deal with and regulateyour emotions, is so critical,especially in today's worldwhere you are always emotionallyso charged and vulnerable,and so much keeps happening with us.This book sets the tone and foundation foryou to understand emotional intelligence.I believe this book is a mustfor every 20-year-old.Number 8:Influence, The Psychology of Persuasionby Robert Cialdini.I think that's how his last nameis pronounced.It's a great book!When I read this book I was blown away.Why?Because by using human psychology,Robert teaches us the art of persuasion.How to persuade people withoutcoming across as forceful?What are the things that triggerour human psychology?And that gets us to agree to somethingwithout even realizing thatwe have been manipulatedin a way to get into that agreement.A brilliant book for everybodybecause through this,forget whether we want to persuade or not,or negotiate or not,but we are able to understandthe nature of people including ours.Thinking, Fast and Slowby Dan Kahneman.It's an incredible book!It's a difficult book!But what it essentially says isthat our mind is divided into two parts.One part thinks quickly.Call it gut, call it intuition.You see something and it is instantlydecided what is going to happen.And then there is the second partwhich is the slow part of the brain.And slow doesn't mean that it is useless.Slow means that it reflects,it takes its time to come upwith a decision, it ponders over it.And the book basically helps usunderstand how is the balancebetween them created.Which part should be usedin which circumstance?Which part is uselessin which circumstance?And how do you find the balancebetween the two?Incredible book!When it came out,it change the world in many ways,still continues to.By the way, it's quite an old book.And he got a Nobel prize.Him and, actually his partnerdid not get it,but Amos Tversky and Dan Kahnemandid amazing research and came upwith the foundations of human psychologyfrom this bookwhich then came out in print.Number 10:The Four Agreements: A Practical Guideto Personal Freedom by Don Miguel Ruiz.It's an amazing book!It's a great self-help book!I'd say somewhere in the middleof being easy and hard.But basically, how can you feel freein your life?Personal freedom which is outsideof your relationships, your job,your emotions, your world,your circumstances,how do you actually live lifewithout feeling burdened?It's a very interesting book.But as I said, this book will landin some people's life at the right timeand in some people's lifeat the wrong time,but it becomes a function ofwhat you draw from it,and when do you read it.10 books are done, 5 or

writtenin our language.It's a new age book,f word has been used very easily,it is very relatable and open.And what it essentially says iswe don't have to get emotionalover everything in our life.We have limited energy.Spend that energy in the right direction,don't waste it.And it's a great bookto help and understandhow you even get to that point.Highly recommended!Number 12:Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a WorldThat Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain.If you are an introvert which 50%of the world claims to be,then this book is for you.Because often we feel thatonly extroverts will conquer this world.They are the ones who can go upon the stage and say something withabsolute confidence in fluent English.They are the ones who sing,create art, or create content,or they are sports people, etc.But what we don't fully understandand realize is thata lot of successful peoplein this world are introverts.And this book is a beautiful wayto come to terms with the fact thathow your introversion can become a power,a weapon for you to win over the world,not just your life.Very very good book,particularly for introverts.Number 13:Grit: The Power Of PassionAnd Perseverance by Angela Duckworth.This is one book that has genuinelyhelped me a lot out of these 15 booksthat I will share.Research Angela Duckworth has triedto find the answer to one question.What is one quality that hasthe highest level of impacton the success of one's life?What is one quality which isthe strongest indicator of successin one's life?And her answer was grit.Grit means a passionwhere you don't give up,where you keep moving forward,where you work with passion in a way,not because it consumes you,but because you know there isno other world, there is no other way.There is only one way.Wake up every morning and work.Wake up every morning and become better.Wake up every morning,listen to the world, keep your ears open,keep your eyes open,keep your mouth closed,and try to fix whateverthey are saying about you.Brilliant approach toward life!This is my life view, maybe that's whyI relate to it the mostout of the 15 books.Pick it up, you will not regret it.Number 14:The 5 Love Languages: The Secret To LoveThat Lasts by Gary Chapman.Did you know that there are5 ways to express love?Did you know that everyone treatslove differently?This book will answerthese questions for you.It's a great book if you wantto understand love,especially in your 20swhen there are a lot of relationships.Our relationship with our parentsis changing.It's changing with our siblingsand friends.We are looking for a partneror we already have one,so there is that relationship.And our relationship with ourselves.All of these are something thatthis book can help you with.And finally number 15:The book by Shawn Achor,The Happiness Advantage:Seven Principles of Positive PsychologyThat Fuel Success and Performance at Work.A self-help book, very broad-based,but something that will give youa nice happy view of most thingsthat you ought to know in life,driven by the fact thathow can you be happy in life.How can you win in lifeby being happy with life?Highly recommended,and something that every 20-year-oldshould certainly read at leastonce in their 20s.These 15 books, as I said,you can get these through this process.Not all 15, but one of the 15 books,I repeatedly say the same thing.First of
