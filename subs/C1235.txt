Number 1: My balcony.Right after I wake up,I drink a glass of waterfor almost 15 minutes. So, I take a lot of time,and I usually drinkthat in this balcony. So, we live on the 13th floor. We are overlooking the entire Aravalli range.And it is almost 12:00 p.m. now.So, there is a lotof noise on the road.But imagine this at 5:00 a.m. in the morningwhere my glass,my thoughts,no phone, no person,no book, no music, and the only thing is just me and my thoughts and my glass of water.Every single sip,for 15 minutes,and it's the best start of the day, because I don't start in a hurry.I wake up slowly.I remember my dreams.I think about the plan for my day.Ruchi goes to play tennis intennis court right over there.So, I look at herbecause she goes to play at 5:30 a.m., and so on.It's one of my favourite spots very early on. We have installed sound proof doors. So, when the day begins,and the sound of trafficor noise start happening, then it isolates us.But at night or early morning, this is like a beautiful setting.This is our kitchen garden where we grow our own vegetable. So, mostly, the leafy vegetables like spinach, we grow them here. And this is our space.We really like it.Particularly from the 13th floor, the view is wonderful.
