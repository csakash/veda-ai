Number 1: Own assets.How well do youunderstand the differencebetween assets and liabilities?We often do you mistakenly think that anything we purchase becomes an asset? But that's incorrect.An asset is something thatgenerates income for you.A liability is something thatrequires you to spend money on it.So, for instance,the house you live in isnot an asset if younever plan to sell it.It's a liabilitybecause you spend money onits upkeep and maintenance,and you don't earn money from it.While it provides a comfortable life,don't confuse it for a liability.When you buy a car,its price depreciates by10-20% the moment youstep out of the showroom.It depreciates in value every year.Owning a car entailsexpenses such as maintenance,petrol, driver, parking,and many more things. A car is not an asset.It's a liability.On the other hand,if you invest in stocks,like buying shares of Reliance,then essentially,buying that stock meansthe harder its employees work,the more benefits you get.Itâs crazy, right? Because if you hold that stock and it earns money for you, then that becomes an asset.Even when purchasing gold,and then you rent out that gold for a personal loan for somebody,or generating income for yourself,while keeping that principalor that asset in place, then it turns into an assetbecause it is generatingmoney for you.Similarly, if you buy property such as a house or a shop and rent it out,the rental income becomesa source of money for you, and it also appreciates in valuemaking it an asset.The difference betweenassets and liabilities is the biggest difference between people who donât understand moneyand people who understand money,and a sure-shot way ofgoing from rags to riches isthat over time, whatever money you earn,which we will talk about,you will buy assets with it and not liabilities.In this video, we will discuss sixsignificant methods through whichyou can steer your lifetowards prosperity,because there are twovery striking data pointswhich are essential for you.On one side, India isexperiencing rapid growth, becoming the fourth-largest GDP in the world.Modi ji asserts thatwith a third term,India could rise tothe third-largest GDP.When he assumed office in 2014,India was the tenth-largest,and now we hold the fourth rank.This suggests that rather thaninvesting solely in mutual funds,it will keep growingand our wealth accumulationwill keep happening,and thatâs one side of itwhich is the GDP growth.On the flip side, theaverage GDP per capita, the money we earn on an average,and that is hovering around $2,200,approximately 1.5 to 2 lakh rupees. That is the average GDP per capita.If you look at incometax return data,then to be consideredmiddle class in India,income of 1 to 1.5 lakhrupees per year is necessary.If your earnings are between1 to 1.5 lakh rupees, you are middle class in India.In fact, if your earnings arebetween 5 to 10 lakh rupees, you are already part of the top 10% of all Indians who file income taxes. So, you are already rich. Why do you want to be richer?Despite this, rising expenses due toinflation often outpace income growth,creating financial challenges,and our income is not enough.Therefore, relying solely on chance, you will remain middle-class and thatâs not what you want.Number 1: Own assets,and an important mindframe of owning assets is, âDonât rent just your time.âOften, we perceive ourtime as a rented commodity.I'm not discussingdaily wage labour.This is relevant in thecorporate world as well. You are not paid every day,but you are paid every month.The salary you earn is tied to thequality and performanceof your work,but you have to show up at work to earn that money.Taking leaves and expecting toearn money for free isn't feasible.And that implies, if you possess 24 hours, a resource shared by every person, then how much more can you makeif you keep renting your time? The conclusion is,you'll begin to rent not your timebut your knowledge.Here's an example:I'm creating this video, free of any advertisements,and I won't earn revenue from it. This video will be on YouTube without generating income for years. So, why am I doing it? I'm doing itto cultivate trust inyou through this video,to extend a helpinghand through this video,and if I can offer assistance,then perhaps you might considerplacing trust in Ankur Warikoo.Yes, you might start payingattention to what he imparts,maybe even take histeachings seriously.Why am I doing it?It's because I'm involvedin an educational startup,a venture aimed atpreparing people for thechallenges of life byimparting education.And that is where I charge money,albeit a nominal onebut not available for freeas I'm committed to ensuring thatpeople value thequality of the courses.And the best thing is those courses are self-paced.I don't invest ongoing time in thembeyond the initialcourse creation phase.Presently, as I'm making this video,in the backend,one of you might bepurchasing the course,thereby generating income for me.The time I invested initiallyto develop the course,continues to yieldbenefits to this day.Through this video, I'm building a trust enginethat keeps that enginemoving and moving.This encourages people to notice thatAnkur Warikoo has made a new course.If you find his videos valuable,you might consider testing his courses. If they resonate well,life could take a positive turn. If not, the option of a refund remains,and it becomes a far easier decision to make but in my mind, I've already reserved my time.With that time,I can generate additional assets,further fuelled bythe income I generate,and I keep multiplyingmy source of incomeeven withoutspending my time.You need to think like this.Number 2:Side income creation.Your professionalincome is not enough.Here's a stat.If your income was â¹100 in 2011, it has grown to â¹135 by 2023,which is the average incrementsthat people have givenin the corporate world. However, in 2011, an item that cost â¹100 now costs â¹160.Due to inflation, the priceincrease to â¹160 is evident.Thus, it's clear thatif you've climbed the corporateladder over the past 10-12 years,your income has likelygrown at a slower rate than the cost of actual products you and I consume.Consequently,relying solely on yourprimary income isn't viable.You need to establishside income sourcesand investing time for itis absolutely the rightinvestment to make, but recall point number one.Utilize your time in a mannerthat requires you to notinvest time regularlybut only a one-timeinvestment of time is neededand you can reap the benefits of thatover a period of time.Initially, you might needto invest time for it,Here's an example:You initiate a freelance business. Let's say designing,video editing, sound engineering,or content writing,or anything else.You will need todedicate time for it,but you do it along with your day job,you dedicate two to threehours per day to this venture,and you create that income.As you generate income,you start acquiring assets.It could be stocks,it could be real estate, it could be gold,it could be property,it could be your own skills to yield a better income.Consequently, you buy more assets.Those assets generate more income.The income creates more assets. At some point,you recognize At some point, you realizethat your income
from asset buildingcan replace your side income.At that point,you can quit your side incomeand either chooseanother side income,or you build on your assetsand grow it even more.This will be the mechanismthat you useto create side incomes.It can be your own business, freelancing,or tutoring.Many videos I havecreated can help yougenerate side incomethrough various ways.Please check the descriptionand pinned comment for it, but the purpose of side income is to generate an income and buy assets.Number three: Budgeting.The biggest mistake people makewhen they start generating incomeis that they end upsplurging on that money.This is because in the beginning,when we are young, money becomes quite addictiveand feels really good.You can buy sneakers with it,you can buy a laptop with it,you can buy a phone with it, you can buy cars,you can buy great clothes,you can eat out,you can party,you can go on vacations,all of which I wouldencourage you to do, but according to a budget.This week, I releaseda video about how my wife and I together earn â¹1.25 crore a yearand how we spend that â¹1.25 crore.The biggest thing in that was40% of that â¹1.25 croregoes towards our needs,which includes your EMI,your children's school fees,household expenses,electricity, water,and food costs, so on.Then, your desires come in, and in those, we only spend 27%.So, this could be your vacation, your aspirations,whether you want to buy a car,buy a phone, whatever you want to do.And then, almost 30-31% is investment, where we are buying assets.Those assets willeventually set us freeand will serve everythingthat we want in life,whether it's buying a house, getting our children educated,going on a luxurious vacation, buying an expensive car,or anything else.You basically pile upa sum of moneythrough which you can fulfilall your desires in life, but through a disciplined approach.So, the biggest mistakethat poor people make is that as soon as they get money,So, the biggest mistake thatpeople with apoverty mindset make is that as soon as they get money, they spend it allto show the world thatwe have money now.This attitude is wrong.Please spend that money wisely. The 50-30-20 ruleis an awesome budgeting principle.Allocate 50% for your needs, 30% for your desires,and 20% for buildingassets or investments.Number 4:Not ignoring an activeincome stream is crucialbecause your income isn't increasingas rapidly as your expenses.This doesn't meanyou should quit yourjob and solely focuson a side income.You also need to activelymanage your primary income.By definition, it is your active income.It is something inwhich you specialize,something for which youdedicate 10-12 hours a day,something you are qualified for, something for which you have a job and receive a salary.So why would you notfocus on that as well? There are so many peoplewho complain when theylook at their job.They keep complainingthat this is missing, the manager isn't good,the work isn't good,the office isn't good,this isn't there, that isn't there. But if you want to take anactive controlover your life when itcomes to that income stream,you can significantly changeit to a considerable extent.Just like negotiating.Why do so many peoplenot negotiate properlybefore accepting anoffer or joining a company?There are so many individualswho do so much research to buy a phone at the right price, to buy clothes at the right price,to use Zomato or Swiggywith the right discounts. But when it comes to your salary,you don't negotiate.You don't conduct market researchto know what salary offersyou should mostly be getting.You don't research your credentials.You don't prepare a pitchor understand why you shouldbe get more money thanwhat's been offered.Why wouldn't you spend2-3 hours on thisagainst saving â¹1,000? Someone might go to the market and buy a new mobile phone.Whereas if you had spent thosesame 2-3 hours sitting down and strategizing your negotiation, you could have changed the courseof your active income journey.Due to this, appraisals.Every year, there areappraisals in the company,and many people acceptthe appraisal whilein their hearts,they keep complainingthat even after puttingin so much hard work, they are still below expectations,meet expectations.It is only a 4-5% increment,and that might be true that the environment isn't right,the company isn't doing well.But it's also possiblethat if you genuinelyfocus only on the appraisal process and make an effort to excel in it, you will be able to win that game.This doesn't mean you have tocompromise your principles.It doesn't mean you haveto do anything immoral.It doesn't mean you have to indulge in politics. It simply means thatevery company has anappraisal process. Understand that process well. Deliver what is expected from you.Keep taking constant feedback.Ensure that your manager is ontop of the game when it comes torepresenting you in front ofthe appraisal committeeor promotion committee.And in the end, even after doing all this,if you don't get thedesired result or outcome,then stand up for yourself and ask.And then, that may be a job switch.If the company isn'tvaluing you with respectthe way you value yourself,and you've done everythingthat was required,then please switch your job.Job switches wereoften seen with anegative view in the past,especially in ourparents' generation,where they stayed in thesame job for 10-20-40 years.That stability wasnecessary back then, but in today's world,changing jobs every 2-5 yearsand benefiting monetarily, benefiting in terms of experience,and benefiting in terms of growth, is not a foolish strategy.I'm saying this with 100%certainty that you should do it.Definitely do it,especially if the company isn'trecognizing yourwork and commitment.So, number 4,actively engage in genuineactive income management.Number 5:Protection.Not that protection.Financial protection.The biggest tragedy occurswhen you've done everything right, built assets,managed your active income,generated side income, but unfortunately, an incident occurs, and everything is wiped away.How many stories have weheard like this, right?How many storieshave we heard where during Covid,people's entiresavings got wiped outbecause someone got hospitalized,someone passed away,or due to an accident,someone's income stream halted,and slowly, their hard-earnedsavings got wiped out.or due to an accident,someone's income stream halted,and slowly, their hard-earnedsavings got wiped out.You have to ensure that whatever you do,you are always protected.And protection hasthree basic fundamentalswhen it comes to finance.Firstly,Firstly,protection against thestoppage of income. If, God forbid, your income stopsdue to personal reasons orcompany decided to lay off employees,and anything happens, you should have money saved up,at least 6 months' worth of expenses, ideally 12 months' worth,to manage your life.This is what we call an emergency fund.This emergency fund should be atleast six times yourmonthly expenses,ideally twelve times.You can park thisemergency fund in an FD,keep it in your savings account,or even keep some of it in cash.It's your choice.But having this fundis very important.The second thing is health insurance.Covid has taught us very stronglyhow damaging health expenses can be.It's crucial to havehealth insurancefor yourself, for your family,for your children. It's important for your parents as well, especially as they are agingand their health expensesare likely to increase.Don't make themistake of clubbing yourhealth insurance withthat of your parents.Your health insuranceand your parents'health insurance should be separatebecause as soon asyour parents cross 60,the premium for their healthinsurance will spike significantly,and you will also have topay a higher premium on that.So, two separate insurances.If you have insurancefrom your company,even then, maintain yourown insurance separatelybecause the day you leave the company, that insurance will lapse.So, it's important thatyou have two insurances,one for yourselfand your family,and one for your parents,and it should be seperatefrom the company's insurance.The third protection is life insurance. If something were to happen to you,or your life,it's your responsibility to ensurethat your family is protected.And this means life insurance,where in the event of your death,your family willreceive a cover amount.The best product forthis is term insurance.In the previous video, I provided a detailed overview of the policy market.Please check that out.Policy Bazaar is one ofthe best platforms to buyany insurance from becauseyou can compare andevaluate all the insurances,get the best pricing,and take advantage ofongoing offers occasionally.So, all of that is possible.Term insurance is my personallyfollowed recommendation, and have a one-year emergency fund blocked in an FD.In terms of health insurance,I have a â¹50 lakhhealth insurancefor myself and my family,with â¹9 lakhs as the basic insurance and an additional top-up of â¹41 lakhs.Separately, there is a â¹15 lakhbase insurance for my parents,with a top-up of â¹20 lakhs.And then, for life insurance,there's a cover of â¹10 crore. In the event of my demise,my family,particularly my wife,will receive â¹10 crore.These three protections arenecessary for you to ensureif anything happensto you or your health,your savings andassets don't deplete.Number 6: The right company.The poverty mindset,that is a sucking mindset,because in that mindset,we oftenencounter people who complain.They say nothing can happen, the government won't do anything, the world won't do anything,the company won't do anything, the manager won't do anything,nothing is going to change.They simply complain,lacking control in their hands.So, you have to surround yourselfwith people who havea wealthy mindset,and a wealthy mindset isn't about having a car,a bungalow, pride, or extravagance. A wealthy mindset means I understand the value of money, I respect money,I use it in the right way,I value my time,and I use it properly.When you surround yourselfwith such ideas, such people,such content,your mind opens up.You get clarity. This is why I sayread the right books on money."Rich Dad, Poor Dad" "The Psychology of Money""I Will Teach You to Be Rich" These are excellent books,and you can start with that because it gets clear in your mindsethow to think about money.On Twitter, you'llfind many good people.You can follow their content.The author of "The Psychology of Money"Morgan Housel, oftencreates content on Twitter.He has his own blog aboutcollaborative funds,which he operates.Reading his content, you gain so much knowledgethat it is unbelievable.Keep this mindset with your company,because when youare able to do that, you think very differently. For me, the biggest addition is my wife.Ruchi has been thinking aboutmoney the right wayfrom a very early age.She started investingat the age of 20,and no one else in herfamily used to invest.She often asks,"I don't even knowhow this investingbug came over me."But she started with SIPs in mutualfunds since the age of 20 years.Now, at the age of 43, she has more financial stabilityand strength than anybody else I knowat her age.That's because she has beencompounding her money for 20-25 years.And this money hassaved us so many times!When we were in debt because ofbad decisions that I made,when I was startingmy own startup and funding was scarce,when I had to cut mysalary significantly, she saved us again.Recently, she paid offthe loan on our house.She provided a bulk amount in it.Whenever have been down-and-aboutor we needed money,she just had it.And that company made me wisertowards my money as well.Number 7: A positive sum mindset.What is a positive sum mindset? There are two mindsets.One is called the zero-sum mindset.The zero-summindset was India'spredominant mindsetuntil 20-30 years ago.We believed that in order to win,we had to make someone else lose.If someone else won, it meantwe were certain to lose.Basically,for someone to win, someone else had to be defeatedbecause finite resourceswere available in the world,and this was true forIndia for the longest time.Resources were finite,opportunities were finite,and due to this,if you wanted to win,you had to ensure someoneelse's failure for your success.Today, the world is different.It has become a positive sum game.There is an opportunityfor every individual.There is amplespace for everyone.So, if you think youpossess an abundant mindset,a positive sum mindset,you will start thinking about thatin money terms as well.You don't need someone else to bepoor for you to become wealthy.You don't need to cutsomeone else's throat to get rich. Not anymore.Think about it this way.In 2020, when I startedcreating content actively,especially on personalfinance on YouTube,was I the first person to do it? Of course not.There were many experts who werecreating fantastic content before me.And the way I thoughtabout this is,"Maybe I can add to that."But someone else's defeatisn't necessary for my victory.And when you think about this, after three years, that's exactly how it's turned out.Whether you take a look at Rachna,or take a look at Akshat,or take a look at Pranjal,or take a look at LLA,all of them have grownand so have I.And that's beautiful, right?It's positive sum.No one had to losefor everybody to makea mark at their own endwhich is why when I make a course,we recently launched the âHow to YouTubeâ course,then we launched âHow to Instagramâ. Right now, we are making âHow to LinkedInâWhy am I making this content?And why am I teaching the oneswho are technically my competitionbecause they can thencreate a YouTube channel, they can make an Instagram channel,they will start creatingcontent on LinkedIn,because I know itâs a positive sum game.There is space foreveryone in this world,and if you share and if youhave that abundant mindset,it changes something in you. It unlocks opportunitiesthat very few people are able to see.Remember in lifethat the world isn'ta zero-sum game. It's a positive sum game.So, when you combinethese 7 things,Number 1: Own assets.Don't rent your time. Rent what you know.Number 2: Generate side income.Number 3: Work witha budget approach.Number 4: Actively controlyour active income.Number 5: Protect your financials. Protect your money.Number 6: Changeyour mindset withthe right ideaand the right company.Number 7: Have that mindset,a positive sum mindset, an abundant mindset.With these 7 methods,you'll ride on India'seconomic growth. You will become richin the next 10-20 years because we are set for unprecedented growth.But you need a mindset,a way, a process, to get out of the poverty mindset and embrace the prosperity mindset.I hope this was helpful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
