Your home loan couldbe 100% free for you.It means you do not need topay any interest to the bank. How?I'll show you the Excel sheet.What does a freehome loan mean?It means the interestthat you paid to the bank,you earned it throughsome other meansso that after the tenure,or after the loan ends, the interest you paid and the money you earned was equal.It means the loanbecame completely free.How is it done?The Excel sheet will tell us.Consider that 50 lakh rupeesis the cost of the house.Now, the bank says,âA part of the paymentwould be the down payment, and the rest can be loaned.âUsually in India,you can get a loanfor 75% of the total.It means for thishouse of 50 lakhs,you would have to pay 12.5 lakhs as down payment,and the rest canbe loaned to you.So, the maximum loan available for this house is 37.5 lakh rupees.Now, I want to tell youthat instead of takinga loan of 37.5 lakhs,if you take a loanfor a lesser amount,then how this loancan be free for you? It might seem weird,but the math confirms this, and I have done it myself.Suppose the tenure ofthe loan is 25 yearsand the rate of interest is 8%.Now, the EMI of this loanwas nearly 29,000 rupees,which is these 37.5 lakh rupees,if this amount isloaned for 25 years at 8% interest,then nearly 29,000 rupeeswould be the EMI,and just because wehave assumed right nowthat we have taken the loanfor the maximumpossible amount for us,the EMI for both is the same.If it were takenfor a lesser amount,then the EMI would'vebeen different,and we will see how thecalculation changes. After 25 years,you will pay thebank 37.5 lakh rupeesbecause that is yourprincipal amount,but the total amountthat you pay the bank, it would be almost 87 lakh rupees.So, the interestwould be nearly 50 lakh rupees,even more than the principal,way more than the principal. These 50 lakh rupeesare what we have to save.We have to turn these50 lakhs into a zero,because if we savethese 50 lakh rupees, our home loan would be free.There are two waysto save this money.Number 1: Tax benefit. If you are an Indian citizen,then the government gives youtax benefits ontaking a home loan.What is it? In a financial year,out of the total interest paid,maximum 2 lakh rupees is tax free, and for the principal paid,maximum 1.5 lakh rupees is tax free.Tax free does notmean that your tax isreduced by 2 lakh rupeesor 1.5 lakh rupees. No.You do not have to paytax on these 2 lakh rupeesand you do not have to paytax on these 1.5 lakh rupees. So, this tax is a benefit.It means ultimately, you don'thave to spend money on it, and it adds up for you.So, consider that yourtax bracket is 20%.So, you are not at 30%,you are at 20%.So, for this entiretenure of 25 years,you would save nearly14 lakh rupees in taxes.It means if you hadn'ttaken this home loan,you would've had to pay these14 lakh rupees as taxes,but because youtook this home loan,you would not have topay these 14 lakh rupeesin the form of taxes.This is saving number one.So, out of 50 lakhs,these 14 lakhs aredirectly subtracted,not directly,I mean it has sometime value because it might decrease, it might increase,inflation will be there and so on,but I am calculatingon an averageso that you get an idea.So, 35 lakh rupees are left.These 35 lakhs are paidto the bank as interest,but becauseyou took the loan for themaximum possible amount for you,you would not get anyadditional benefits.Now, let's understand howyou can get these benefits.Suppose that instead of takingthis loan of 37.5 lakh rupees,I take a loan ofjust 32 lakh rupees.What does it mean?Number 1: I have that money,because that is animportant consideration.So, if you have 12.5 lakh rupeesfor the downpayment but in addition, you also have 5 lakh rupees,then you will not bestupid enough to say,âLet's keep these5 lakh rupees with usand take loan forthe entire amount.âNo.You would do the opposite. You would say, âThese 5 lakh rupeeswould also be paidas the down paymentand I would take a loanfor a lesser amount.âAnd let's see how thatmakes a difference.Now, because you were ready totake the loan of 37.5 lakh rupees,meaning technically,you were also ready to paythe EMI of 29,000 rupees,but now you need to pay theEMI of only 25,000 rupees. It means on an average, every month,you are saving 4,245 rupees.Now, these savingswould be smartlyinvested by you. So, this amount that you saved,you will not spend it on mobile phones or a car or on shoes, you will invest it, and we are assuming that it will be a very conservative investing. So, we will say, âWe would invest it at 10%.â Not much.So, this amount that you saved,you will not spend it ona mobile phone or a car or on shoes, you will invest it, and we are assuming thatit will be a veryconservative investing.So, we will say,âWe would invest it at 10%.âNot much.If you put your moneyinto the stock market,it would give alsoyou 12% returns,but we are assuming 10% for now.So, this amount,this amount of 4,245 rupees invested every month for 25 yearsand growing at 10% will give you 56 lakh rupees.56 lakh rupees!How much interest, on an average,after tax saving,did you pay the bank?30 lakh rupees.The extra money that you spent, how much was it?4,245 rupees invested for 25 years and it became56 lakh rupees.It means at the end of the tenure, you earned 27 lakh rupees. You earned. You did not pay the bank.You earned that money.Now, let's playwith this number.If this numberwas 35 lakh rupees.It means your down payment wouldincrease by just 2.5 lakh rupees,then let's see whatthe numbers are.You will pay the bank7 lakh rupees as interest,after deduction.Suppose you took aloan of 35 lakh rupees.It means 2.5 lakh rupees werepaid as extra down payment,and the rest wasyour loan amount. Now, your EMI is 27,000 rupees.You are capable of payingan EMI of 29,000 rupees.So, you can invest nearly2,000 rupees every month.We would grow this investment at the same 10% for 25 years. So, this investment,after growing every month,would become 25 lakh rupees.It means you wouldpay the banka net amount ofjust 7 lakh rupees.How?46 lakh rupees was the totalinterest you had to pay, out of which,you saved 13.5 lakhs through taxes,and you saved 25.5 lakhsthrough investment.In total, you had to paythe bank just 7 lakh rupees,and if wechange this numberto 34,50,000 rupees.If we pay an extra downpayment of 3 lakh rupeesand take a loan of 34.5 lakhs, then you will seethat you would have to pay the bank almost nothing.This is the wayto make your home loan completely free.Summarising.Number 1:The maximum loan you can get,take a loan for a lesser amount. Use this sheet and calculatehow much money can yousave through taxes, and then calculate thatthe extra EMI whichyou would save,how much money would you earnafter investing it.When those numbers are same,meaning this differencebecomes almost zero,you take that amountas a loan,and after takingthat loan amount,you would ensurethat your home loan has now become free.This is howyou make it happen. Now, imagine thatwe do the same thing with smaller numbers.So, consider thatyou bought housefor 1 crore rupees,and for a house of 1 crore,you could get a loanof 75 lakh rupees.But you say, âYou know what?No. I want a loanof 70 lakh rupees only.I would take itfor just 10 years. So, my EMI,which would havebeen 91,000 rupees is now just 85,000 rupees.It means I am ready to invest6,000 rupees every month.My tax savings would be 6.5 lakh rupees because the tenure is just 10 years,and I would earnnearly 12.5 lakh rupees through investment.Despite that,I would have to pay 13 lakh rupees as interestto the bank.So, we will now play with this numberto see at what pointit becomes zero.At 68 lakhs,it is 7 lakh rupees. Let's change it to 65 lakhs.That's it.So, instead of taking aloan of 75 lakh rupees,if I take a loanof 65 lakh rupeesand pay the restas down payment, assuming that I have the money,then I would makethis loan free.30 lakh rupees wouldbe the total interest,out of which, 6.5 lakh rupeeswould be saved through taxes, and nearly 25 lakh rupeesthrough investment making the net payment that I made as interesta negative 1.6 lakhs, meaning 1.6 lakh rupeesis what I earned.This is whyrich people take a home loanbecause they knowthat through this,they can take money ata low rate of interest, at just 8%.They could then invest it in anasset generating higher returnsand make more moneyfor themselvesat the end of the tenure.Something you should do as well.Ankur Warikoo,signing off.
