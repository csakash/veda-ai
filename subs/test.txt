Number 1:Learn to prioritize your tasks.What does it mean?Often when we get a task,we don't know how to approach it.Is this task important?Is this task urgent?Whether to do it now or later?How? Why?To understand this,there is an Eisenhower matrix.What is a matrix?A 2 by 2 matrix.So assume that thereis an x-axis and a y-axis.On X, you are askingwhether this task is urgentor can be done later?Yes or no.And on the y-axis, you are asking,whether this task is important or not?Yes or no.And this will give us 4 sections.Every task in your lifewill fit into one of these 4 sections.For example, if you want towatch Instagram Reels,then is it urgent?Not at all.You can watch it later.Is it important?Absolutely not.It will not make a differenceif you don't watch it today or never.So if you do it,it is neither urgent nor important.It doesn't mean that you should not do it.It means, its importance is the leastamong the four sections.Now which has the highest?Something which is importantas well as urgent.For example, God forbid,if you get a call from your parentsthat there has been an accidentor somebody has gotten ill,can you come quickly?Then there could be nothingmore important than this.It is urgentbecause it needs to be addressed now,and it is important too becausethey are your parents,and that is why you would knowto prioritize it well.So I use the Eisenhower matrixa lot of times to figure outhow to prioritize my tasks.Number 2:Time blocking.This is a masterstroke.Time blocking meanswhenever you do some work,it is very important for youto get into a flow,because if you keep wandering,keep switching the context,then you will never be able toget into a flow.What does flow mean?Flow means you are working in a waythat you do not have any ideaabout the time.You are working at a pace,but with absolute patienceand distraction free,that it seems to you thatthis is your only job.That is called flow.And that usually happenswhen you block time and focus on a task.People often keep switching the context.They keep changing their taskevery half an hour.And that's why your brain gives up.I can't manage doing somethingfor half an hour,and then something elsefor the next half an hour.I am a brain, not a rocket scientist,and that is why it just gives up.Instead, if you say,let's spend 2-3 hours on this task,let's be in a flow.That will allow your brain to focus,to not be distracted,and to make it super productive for you.Number 3:To conquer distraction,a proven mechanism isthe Pomodoro technique.What is the Pomodoro technique?We will work in half an hour slots,where we will work for 25 minutesand take a break for 5 minutes.Again, work for 25 minutesand then a 5-minute break.Again, work for 25 minutesand then a 5-minute break.Again, work for 25 minutesand then a 5-minute break.When we will complete 4 such Pomodoros,then we'll take a longer breakof 30 minutes.So what you essentially do isyou do not tire your mind,because our mind gets tiredafter half an hour.The 5-minute break gives it a breather,and then it comes back to workat a new pace.And if it would be the same work,which is what I describedin the previous point of time blocking,then you will get uninterrupted,focused, distraction-free 2 hoursto let your brain be super productive.Half an hour break and then move onto the next context, the next task.Number 4:Set deadlines.It is a direct hit on Parkinson's law.What is Parkinson's law?Parkinson's law says no matterhow much time you get,you will use all of that timeto complete a task.So if you could complete a taskin an hour,you would do it in an hour.But if you think that you can do itin a day,then you can expand the workand do it in a day.And that means it is very importantfor you to set deadlines.When you set a deadline,you are responsible, you are accountable.You tell yourself that I have to completethis task in this much time,and that will put in that disciplinethat you require to be productiveand to save time.Number 5:Meal planning.It is very important.It is important to eat food,but the mistake that we make is,that we completely forgetabout eating the food,and that is not good.Why?The minute our glucose level goes down,our energy levels also go down,we become irritable, we are distracted,our stomach starts rumbling,then we feel like eating something,and then we start eating junklike chips, pizza, random munchingslike having cookies or something,and that then spikes up your glucose,and you do not then feelthe level of energy that you want.So what you want to do isyou plan your meal.Just the way you will keep a deadlinefor your work in a disciplined manner,you will also keep a deadlinefor your food time.So you will say,I will have my lunch at 1.For whatever time you eat it,whether for half an houror 15 minutes or an hour,whatever the case may be,I will give the most importance to thatfood at that time.Once it is finished,I'll get back to work.And that is how you plan your day.Number 6:Automating your finances.In fact not just finances,but anything you have to dorepeatedly administratively.If you have to pay your credit card bills,what's the need to remember them?Why waste your headspace on that?Just automate that.Use whatever tool you want to.Set it to be paid as soon asa credit card bill comes inor the electricity bill comes inor the phone bill comes in.Don't try to remember anything.I use my calendar extensively.Everything is on my calendar.Where do I have to go in the morningor what do I have to do at nightor during the day, not just meetings,even personal things,like if I have to go tosome relative's function,or if I have to take Uzmaor Vidur somewhere,or something personal,everything, bill payments.All of that is on a calendarso that I don't have to spendany time remembering things.Everything is in my notebook,and I use my mind not to remember thingsbut just to do them.Number 7:Declutter.If your environment is cluttered,everything is scattered,clothes are scattered in the cupboard,books are scattered, the bed is not made,and everything is spread here and there,then your mind will also workin the same way.But if you declutter,it's clean and organized,everything is methodical,it's in its right place.I am basically looking at my tablewhen I am talking becauseI know it is a very organized table,and that is when you bring stabilityand a clutter-free approachto your mind as well.Number 8:Delegate tasks.If you can delegate it to a personor to a tool or a system, please do it.The task you can't do yourselfor you don't want to do, delegate it.For example, now we are in a positionin life where we can afford help.So somebody cooks food for us,cleans up, does the dishes,takes care of the house,we have a driver, a gardener,a person who irons our clothes,a milkman, a newspaper guy,we have help for everything.Why?Because those are the things thatwe can outsource so thatwe can invest our full time in thingsthat give us maximum leverage.Now if you are a student,and you still have to do some chores,let's say your parents have asked youto get something,then use apps where you can getthe delivery for free.It will be delivered in 10-20 minutes,you don't even have to tell your parents,but you just do it on your own.Outsource all of those things,so that you use your time smartly,and you pay the respect to your timethat it deserves.Number 9:Create routines.Routines are the most powerful techniqueto save time.Why?Routine builds a habit in you thatthese are repeatable tasks.So if you don't have a daily routine,then you are missing on something.If you do something new every day,something different every day,your body doesn't get a rhythm,it doesn't understandwhen to prepare for what.That applies to your sleep,that applies to when you wake up,that applies to what you dowhen you wake up,whether it's exercising or meditatingor reading or singing or anything,but you do it withthe sense of repeatabilitywhich is what's called a routine.Number 10:Limit your screen time.Social media is a trap, my friends!The more you use it,the more it attracts you.And that is why the appyou waste your time on,please limit your time on that app.Both on Android and iOS,there is an inbuilt tool,where you can control the timeyou spend on any app on a given day.If you go beyond that time,the app closes.If you want to unlock it, you can do it,but if you put a passcode on it,it will unlock with a passcode only.If you are smart,you will set that passcode,but you will not do it yourself,you will get it done by your friendsor your parents or your siblings,because when that time ends,you will not get greedy to enterthe passcode and watch it foranother 15 minutes or an hour or 2 hours.The passcode is with somebody else,they are not going to give it to you,and you will then becomethe disciplined personthat you need to be.Number 11:Use productivity appsand productivity tools.There are so many tools which allow you,just like there is an app forthe Pomodoro technique,there is an app for your to-do list,there is an app for your email management,there is an app to write your notes.All these apps make you more productive.Of course, don't get trapped in apps,because as much as these appsincrease productivity,they can also reduce productivity,if you are just surrounded by apps.Use those that help you.I used 2-3 apps that make mereally productive.I have an app for my email managementcalled Mailman.I have created two folders on my WhatsAppthat organize all my data properly.I use Asana for all the tasks thatI have to do.In fact, Waricrew, my team uses Asanato manage their own tasks.And you know what, most of the workgets done because of that.Everything that needs to be doneis tracked,of course, Google Calendar is there.With these 3-4 tools,I am highly productive.I don't need much beyond these,but if these 4 tools are not therein my life, then I will be strugglinga lot because a lot of my time will justgo into managing what I have to accomplishduring the day.Number 12:Life hack: Learn to say no.Whenever you say yes to something,you say no to something as well.Somebody asks you for help and you agree,because you want them to love you,think good about you, and praise you,but the minute you say yes to themyou have said no to something else.Something you were doing already,something that you wanted to do,something that you should be doing,you have said no to that,and that is the wrong way to lead life.Learn to say no in life.The more you say yes to the right things,the more important it is to say noto the unnecessary things,because if you don't do that,then you are stuck.Number 13:Use shortcuts.Not in life, in tools.For example, my Gmail has shortcuts.I have learned all the keyboard shortcuts,excel shortcuts, whenever I use any tool,I learn its shortcuts.I just go on to Chat GPT and enterwhat are the best shortcuts,and just learn everything.Make it a habit because thenyou are faster.You don't have to use the mouseand do things.This makes you faster,it makes you better at your work,and it gives you a sense of controlthat you can run your whole worldwith your 10 fingers only.Number 14:Listening to podcasts or audiobooks.A lot of people write to me and ask,Our office commute is really long,one hour or sometimes even 2 hours,what should we do at that time?If we read, we get a headache.That's correct.Don't read.Don't even watch anything.Listen to something becauselistening is not a problem.So listen to a podcast, an audiobook,or a summary of a bookwhich are audio summaries.Because of these,at least you will get some knowledgein that time,you will get to learn something new,which will only make you more productivein the time that you already have whichyou as it is you have to spend.Number 15:Shop online.I know that most of you already do that,but do online shopping forsmall things also as much as you can.For example, buy Amazon Prime if you can.It is the best way for you to save a lot,because it is only for 999 annually,but your time is much more expensivethan that.So you step out, buy groceries,or get the delivery done.It's better to order from Amazon,and this is not an Amazon-sponsored video,it's just that I use Amazon a lot.Or you can buy Zomato Gold,or the Swiggy equivalent,whatever you use more,please value your money,value your time even more,and just be online for whatever you need,so that your time is spentin the right things which could be thingsthat you love doingand not necessarily just work.Number 16 and we do this a lot:Whenever you step out,batch the things thatyou can accomplish in one go.So it's not like you go in one direction,and then you remember thatyou had some workin the opposite direction.No!Because that's a waste of time.Plan your day out whenever you go out.So my wife and I, whenever we go out,we say, if we go in this direction,let's say we're going to Select City Walk,we stay close to Delhi, in Faridabad,so we often go to Select Citywalk, Saket,so if we will be going there,then we can go that sideand then that side,and that's how we'll do the things,so in 2-3 hours when we step out,we'll finish a few tasks.And anything that is outside of it,we will not do it on that day,unless of course it's urgent,we will do it some other timewhen we will be going in that direction,and there will be other tasksin that direction so that you becomemore organized and disciplinedaround how you have to manage your time.Number 17:Speed reading.This is a superpower if you read.I read a lot and I save a lot of timethrough speed reading.We develop speed reading over time.There are techniques thatallow you to speed read.How do you glance at words?How you don't read every word,but try to read the full sentencein a glance?Whenever you stop somewhere,how do you process that?All of that is taught throughthe art of speed reading.A lot of courses in speed readingare available, so you can use them.There may be a lot of such coursesor videos on YouTube,which can teach you how to speed read.If you are an active reader,and you spend a lot of time,then try and speed read,so that you become faster,and you still absorb the same levelof information.Number 18:Batch your emails.Email is a big distraction.So it is the worst thing if you allowyour emails to come whenever they do.No!Batch the emails in a way thatyou receive your emails atsome allotted times in the day.For example, all my emails comeonly three times a day.At 8:00 in the morning,then at 1:00 in the afternoon,and then at 6:30 in the evening.That's it!When I get my emailsat these 3 time slots,how much ever they are,whether 30, 40, or 50,I get into a zone for 15 minutesand clear all those emails.That is how I do not allow emailsto take over my day or my schedule.Number 19:Technology has made this possible.Use voice recognition softwareas much as you can.There are so many people who attendZoom meetings or Google Meet,and then they have to record that video,and then transcribe it to knowwhat they wrote,and then write the minutes of the meeting.Or if somebody has sent a voice note,then transcribe it.There are a lot of tools that convertvoice recognition into text.Use that, become smart about it.A lot of tools transcribe Zoom meetingsas they are happening.Google Meet has a translate optionwhere surprisingly they even translateHindi properly.And you should use that,so that all of that is saved,and you ultimately save time.Number 20:If you exercise, exercise efficiently.There are two ways of exercising.One is the cardio way of doing it.You are running, your calorie is burningwhile you are running,and when you stop running,your calorie burn has also stopped.The second thing is what is calledthe HIIT, High-Intensity workoutwhere you go from one lifting workoutto another in very short durations,so that within 30 minutesyour maximum heart rate,actually not the maximum heart rate,but the zone of maximum calorie burnwhich is usually 120-140 beats per minute,you reach that zone, and it maintainsthat for about 30 minutes.So you will not slow down,you will not take a 5-minute breakafter 5 minutes of running,it is useless.That is actually the worst wayto exercise.The best way is that you enter the gym,and you are out within 30 minuteswith such high intensity thatin those 30 minutes,your heart was pounding and pumping,and you were burning caloriesall throughout.That's what I do and I love it.Number 21:Minimize distractions.This is a golden rule.If you know that the human mind getsdistracted easily,then the best way to ensure thatit doesn't is,remove the distractions, minimize them.Why are your phone notifications on?Why is every WhatsApp messageor a Telegram messageor a Discord messageor an Instagram notification pinging?It shouldn't be like that, my friend,because this will never stop.So if you want a distraction-freetime and zone,then turn off the notificationson your phone.Why is there distraction around you?Why is a chips packet there?Why is the iPad there?Why is that book there?Don't keep these things around you.Anything that distracts you, remove it,remove it from your view.And that will be when you will get intothat zone with minimal distraction,and minimum need for self-controlto fight the distraction.Number 22:Meditate.If you meditate,there are compounding effects of the timethat you meditate.I meditate for 30 minutes.It's not a lot for a day,it seems like a lot but it isn't.But those 30 minutes set my whole daybecause I get so much peace and calmin those 30 minutes,I get the training to be present,to be mindful of what you are,to be grateful for every single breathin your body,that the whole day is sorted,and that's what I love about it.So meditate as much as you can.Even if you start with 10 minutes,they will be such major changesin your day that you will only thank me.Number 23:I have personally observed thisand it is the game changer.Limit the sources of informationin your life.What do I mean by that?Nowadays, we get informationfrom everywhere.From WhatsApp, Twitter, LinkedIn,Instagram, email, newspaper,news channels,from parents, siblings, friends,reduce these sourcesand bring them down to a bare minimum.Have a maximum of 3.I genuinely take information fromthree sources in my life.From Twitter, email, and WhatsApp.Genuinely!If information comes from anywhere else,then be it, otherwise,I don't use it anywhere.I do not.I read the newspaper every day,but I don't use it for information.Why?Because that information is alreadyon Twitter.So there is no new informationin the newspaper,but I like the newspaperfor just the reading of it,for just the joy of it,for just finding that structurewhere somebody has formattedthat newspaper, edited it,so it's nice to read,but that's how I do it.I read the newspaper in 15 minutes.What can you actually read ina newspaper in 15 minutes?But I am happy to read it.But all of my news comes from Twitter.I don't watch any news channel,I don't read any other news,I have not subscribedto any other publication.There are a few newsletters in my emailwhich I get information from.Or there are some forums whereI get information from.People give me information.I get information from WhatsApp,I am a part of some group wherethat information is shared.And that's it.I get my information from there.If there is anything happening beyondthese three in the world,then it may not be important to me.And if it would be important,it would reach me through these threeor any other medium.So I limit the sources of information,and that's why the cognitive loadon my mind is a lot lesser as well.And finally, number 24:This is a brilliant hack.Set distraction time in your day.What are you saying, Ankur?We are trying to keep awaythe distraction.Hear me out.Your mind wanders because it needssomething fun, something exciting.It feels like watching Instagramor YouTube.So you have to tell your mind,dude, we'll watch it in the eveningat 5:00 p.m.So you are mind responds,What? Really? At 5:00 p.m.?Okay, I'll wait.And that's what you do through settinga distraction time.When you want to be distractedduring your day,you want to waste your time,you will set it.You will say, 11:30 to 12 in the morning,5 to 6 in the evening,10 to 11 in the night,whatever the time is in a limit,you will get distracted on purpose,you will waste time on purpose.When you tell this to your mind,your mind gets trained,it doesn't get restless, it is calm.It knows that at 5:00 p.m.,it will get the time,so it waits patiently,and that's what you want.So please set a distraction timein your day, and conquer your day.These 24 ways can change your life.You don't have to follow all 24,but even if you follow 5-7 of these,you will take the first step towardsconquering your day.Which one of these 24did you like the most?Please tell us in the comments section.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off!If you are going abroad to studythen an important decision iswhere you will stay?You can live on-campus,but off-campus is mostly cheaper.But being cheapershould not be the only criterion.Is that accomodation safe or not?How cheap is it and how far is it from the campus?Which other communities live there?Is it even a good place or not?What are the facilities?And of course, all of thesethen make up for a good decision.This video is sponsoredby LeverageEdu,which isone of India's largeststudy abroad consulting firms.And one of their unique product isâFly Homesâ, where1.5 million homes across thirty countriesare listed,which you can choose for yourstudy abroad accommodation.They handle the entire process for you.Not only this,if, god forbid, your visa or cashis not processed,then youâll get full refundbecause they want you to getthe best accomodation that you want for yourself.And if, for whatever reason, it doesnât happenyou get, of course, a refund.Whicever are the services,whether itâs selectionwhether itâs the paymentwhether itâs the entire leasing and signing,all of thatis handled by LeverageEdu experts for you.and you get to actlike a king or a queenselecting where you want to stay.So head over to the websitewhich is in the pinned comment and descriptionand check out Fly Homes by LeverageEdu.
