In this video, I will share with youthe mistakes I made in my first job,so that you don't make the same mistakesin your job.Friends, I made all these mistakesbetween my first and second job,but I have realized that we oftenrepeat these mistakes inour new job again and again.So the purpose of this videois to list all my mistakes,so that you are aware of them,and do not repeat them in your first jobor any new job.The first mistake happenedin my first job.This is something that we are allused to in the Indian culturewhich is when you are givena task or asked any question,the first one to raise their handis always the smartest.This is the training from our classes.This kind of culture was therein our schools and to an extentin our colleges as well,and when you translate it into workcan be disastrous.It was my mistake that I assumedthat speed equals smartnessin an office environment.It is not.But whenever I was given a task,I tried to finish it quickly,as against taking my time to do itthe right way.Always remember that you get a salaryor you have a job so that you doyour work efficiently,and not just quickly.Secondly, in the beginning,I was just very young and fresher,I had no experience,so I was so low in the whole hierarchy,that I used to think that evenif I make mistakes,people working above me, like my managers,my experienced colleague,they will find out my mistakesand let me know about them.I will fix those mistakes,and that is how I will learn,and that is how they will be the managerthat I thought they should be.And that is wrong.I used to think that the task ofmy superiors, my seniors...Why do we even use the wordsuperior in India?I don't know why!Because nobody is called inferior,so how is anybody superior!Anyway, the job of my seniorsor more experienced peoplewas to find mistakes in my work.And that is not the right approach.Their job is to give me allthe opportunities, capabilities,and training, so that I am ableto do my work efficiently,and they are able to do their work.I still remember, and this has beenthe most defining experience I have hadin my working life.It was in my second job,and this is right after ISB,and I got my first projectwhich was around accounting.And I absolutely hate accounting,simply because of the factthat I don't get it.So all CAs out there, I respect you,adore you, because I don't understandwhat is the need for accounting,and the people who follow accountingas a profession, how do the even survive!I was terrible at accounting.And as luck would have it,the first project I got wasan accounting project.There was a big real estate developer,and I had to make a business planfor their huge real estate project,which included the financial statements.So I had to make the balance sheets,profit and loss statements,cash flow statements, and I sucked at it,so I made a ton of mistakes,a lot of mistakes.But I always thought that evenif I make those mistakes,and my managers check themand let me know about them,and I fix them, we are actually improving.And that was the wrong approach,because at some point in time,even if I did my work efficiently,my manager didn't know that becausethey found mistakes in my workfrom their past experiences,so they began to sit again to lookfor errors if there were any,and that meant that they weredoing my job, and not theirs.And that is the worst thingthat you can do in a working environment.At this point, my manager gave mesome advice that has stayed with mefor all my life.He said,'Ankur, if I can't trust you,it doesn't matter how smart you are.If I can't trust you,it doesn't matter how smart, intelligent,for hard working you are,because I simply don't trust you.'And that just changed everything for me.So this mistake that the manager's jobis to correct your errors,taught me my biggest lessonin my working life.I used to think that if my managerhad to share feedback with me,they will do it themselves.They will set a time and call mefor a one-on-one,and they will get it done.The mistake I made was to assumethat to give feedbackwas their responsibility,whereas the truth is,to get feedback is my responsibility.I need feedback for myself,I need feedback for my work.I need to know whether I am doingmy work properly or not,and that is my responsibility.So whenever in any job,whether it's a first job or a new job,it's your responsibility to get feedbackfrom your manageror even from your colleagues.How am I doing?What is it that I can do better?Because if you don't ask,they may never share what you should know.Another mistake that I made was,we had a small department,this was during my first job,and in that small department,around 5-6 people worked.So we used to hang out together.We used to have lunch together.If we arrived at the office early,we used to have breakfast together.If we planned to hang out after office,we would do it together.So our world of those 5-6 peoplewas our entire world.We never used to hang outwith other people,and I felt that that was the waya team bonds.Well, that is a good way for you to bondwith your team,my mistake was that I never bondedwith other people.In fact, I used to think thatI should not meet other people.I always thought like them versus us.This is our small world,don't fiddle with it,you are other people.Finance Department is different,HR department is different,marketing department is different,sales department is different,they are other people,and it almost felt likewe were in conflict,when the truth was, we were not.If I would ask anybody,why do you come to work every day,then almost everyone would say,for the growth of the company.Then why is it that we are in conflictwith each other?It is only because I never tried to getto know about their world.I never tried to find outhow the finance people thinkabout this business.How do the HR people thinkabout this business?Sales, marketing, supply chain, legal,how do they think about this business?Because whenever I find myselfin conflict,what I know is that they know somethingthat I don't know.Their perspective of the worldis different from mine,and if I can get to know that,then it will only make mea better working professional.Spend time with people outsideof your department.Make relationships with them,meaningful relationships,so that you may get to know somethingwhich you don't know today.Often when my manager used to give mesome work and asked me to finish itby Friday,I used to say that it will be doneby Friday,but as Friday approached,I used to realize that I need more timeto complete this work in a better way,maybe till Saturday, and I did that,because that was the right thing to do,the work should be done in a proper way.But I didn't inform anyone.So what happened was Friday cameand Friday went.In my manager's head,Friday was the day that I was supposedto deliver, but in my head,since I was doing the right thingby delivering it on Saturdaywith better quality,not updating became the mistake.One thing that I want to sharewith everyone, if you want to becomethe best working professional,you just need to do one thing,the deadline you committo finishing your work,deliver that, without anybodyasking for an update.If you can deliver your workwithout anybody asking for an update,you are gold.People will appreciate you so much,like you so much, trust you so much,that you will sit on opportunitiesthat most people will never get.Now that doesn't mean thatif you have committed to a deadline,you will have to stick to it,that also means in case god forbid,you are not able to completethat work in the given deadline,then you also updatethat there is a delay.And you do that much in advance.It shouldn't be like if you haveto deliver work at 11:59 p.m.,you send an email at 11:58 p.m.that you will finish the work tomorrow.You do it much in advance becausethat tells me that you were planning,that tells me that you were proactive,that tells me that you had a way,a mechanism to get to it,and if you are not able todeliver it on time,then there must be a genuine reasonbehind that.At work, I used to think,and a lot of people must be feelingthe same way,if I keep doing my work properly,I will automatically be promoted.But that isn't true.It isn't true because we thinkthat good work equals to promotion.Not always!When you get promoted,you get an additional responsibility,and the question to ask is,am I ready for that responsibility?Whether it is to manage a team,whether it is to manage a big project,or a big budget, or a big target,whatever the case may be, the question is,am I ready for this responsibility?Give me feedback on that.What do I have to doto get ready for that responsibility?Don't assume, the mistake that I made,just because I'm working efficiently,I'm getting good appraisals,I'm getting good ratings,I will automatically get a promotion.This is not a tenured system,where with time,people are automatically promoted.This is a merit-skill-based system,where ideally you should be promoted onlywhen you have the skills requiredfor that level.Till the time you don't,you will stay at the level that you are,getting ready for the next level,and once you are ready for the next level,you will be promoted,which has nothing to do withhow well you are doingat your current level.This is a very common mistakethat people often make especiallyin their first job or their early jobs.Whenever someone asks themwhat is your salary expectation,they convert their desireinto their expected salary.So they are like,'I want to buy a bike, a phone,I want to go on a vacation, buy clothes,pay this much rent, blah blah blah,add all this up, and this iswhat my expected salary is.'So we make the mistake of translating ourindividual needs into a company salary.But the truth is that a companydoesn't care about what's going onin your life.They don't care whether you have totake care of two loans or no loans at all.They don't care whether you wantto buy an expensive car or no car at all.They have a budget for every roleand your salary will be decided dependingon that budget.When they ask for an expectation,what they are trying to figure out iswhether your expectation is aroundthat budget or not.Because if it isn't,then they can't afford it,they may still give you an offer,but you will not be happy with itbecause it is less than your expectation.So the right way to think aboutthis is to always assessthe company's budget around this role.This will happen through conversationswith people who are alreadyin the company.You can check on review siteslike Glassdoor.You can message those people on LinkedInwho used to work in that companybut aren't there anymore.All of these things will broadly give youa ballpark of salary in this role,in this position.And then you have to ask yourselfdoes that fit into what I want?But don't translate your desires,your needs into your salary,because the company does not think of itthat way.This is reflective of companieswhere there is too much politics.During lunch or tea break,you are sitting in your group,and then bitching starts.They are not doing this,look at them what they are doing,that department has useless people,they don't do any work,who knows how they got promoted,do you know how much salarythey are getting,how come they bought a car,and you get sucked into it.You think that if you participatein that discussion,it will show your devotion to your team.But that is always the wrong way to do it.The truth is, it is very easyto give commentary,but it is very difficultto play on the field.Until and unless, you are not playingon the field, you have no rightto comment on anybody else.And the more you engage in it,the more you will get sucked into it,the more you will think thatthe world is against you.I have seen so many smart and capablepeople failing,because they got sucked intothis entire commentary that somebody elseis getting more than us,somebody else is getting promotedand not us.This zero-sum approach is where we feelthat for somebody to winsomebody has to lose.But that is not the case.In companies, corporates, in capitalism,zero-sum doesn't exist,everything can be produced in abundance.Everybody can get promoted,and they will, until and unlessyou don't believe that for you to win,it is necessary for somebody else to lose.I used to get a task,and I used to finish it,and I felt, since I finished that work,I have done my job right.But I never paused and asked,why did I get that task?What will be achieved because of my work,and when and how will it be achieved?If I didn't stop and ask myself,what difference is my work making,then I am just doing my work.And that means if any other personcan do my work in a faster, cheaper,and better manner, I will be replaced.Don't focus on the output.The task you are given,what you have to do if the output.Focus on the outcome.Why did you get that task?And ask that question, find that answer,what will be achieved by doing this work?And if you focus yourself on that,you will become so important in the team,because whenever anybody gives yousome work, they will say,'Whenever I give her some work,she comes back with so much morethan what I expected,because she thought aboutwhat difference will her work make,and that makes her indispensable.'Often if the manager was rude, toxic,yelled at people, did not behave properly,or did not respect people,I automatically started blamingthe whole organization.I used to be like,'The company is useless,people are hopeless.'I never stopped to isolate whetherthe manager's behavior and the behaviorof the company leadershipare the same or not.Because here's the truth.If the manager is doing somethingin which the company leadershipdoesn't believe,and neither is it visible to youin the company leadership,then the problem is with the manager,not in the company.But if they are doing something which isendorsed by the company leadership,in fact, the company leadershipalso behaves in the same manner,then the problem lies with the company.And these two are very different things.If you ever feel that your manageris behaving in a way that doesn't matchthe culture of the company,it is your moral responsibilityto report it, to raise your voice,because then the company willacknowledge you, thank you,for finding something which wasa fault in the system.But if the company leadershipand the manager are vibingin the same culture,endorsing the same culture,and that doesn't fit intohow you think things should be,then it would be very difficultto fight it,and that may mean that you would haveto find yourself a different place,a new place.Whenever my manager triedto find mistakes in my work,I used to take it personally.I used to feel extremely low.I used to think,'What would they be thinking about me?They must be thinkingthat I don't know anything?'Sometimes I used to be angry toobecause I felt I did the right job,and howcome they said something.But at the end of it, I asked myselfthis question,why is the manager doing it?What is the intent behind them correctingme or telling me about my mistakes?And I realized that at the end of it,if I put aside the personal attack,and focus only on what is being said,then it might help me.Because whatever is told to me,if I keep it in my mind and reflect on it,then I might become a better individualthan who I was,I might do things betterthan what I was doing earlier,and this isolation,this distinction was very very helpful.Often we look at a person,and think that this managerjust wants to attack us, but for a while,just put aside that personand listen to what they are saying,and if it makes sense,then it might help you improveand become a better version ofwho you are.I started my first job at the age of 24,I had just dropped out from my Ph.D.,I had no idea about what life is.I had no idea about actual life,what are sales, marketing, finance, HR,no perspective at all.So I made many mistakes,some of which I stated in this video,I learned a lot, I got to know a lot,but what I also realized wasthat college life and working lifeare miles apart,and I am glad that I went throughthese mistakes early on,because they prepared mefor the real world.I understood the mistakes I was makingwhich I didn't think were mistakes.And the things I was doingwhich I thought could be mistakes,but in the end,they were actually beneficial for me.I always told myself that workinghere is my own choice.If I am not happy, it's my choice,if I am happy, that too is my choice,if I am learning something,that's my choice,if I am not learning anything,even that is my choice,and this level of responsibilityand accountability helped a lot,because suddenly only one personwas responsible,me myself.If I was able to learn something,I could blame myself,if I was not able to learn anything,I would still blame myself,and that helped me immensely.The first few days of the first jobor for that matter any jobare very precious,because you are in a new environment,new family, observe people in a new way,you learn a new way of doing,and you are bound to make mistakes,but at the end,repeating the same mistakesis a mistake forgotten.And I would love for all of younot to repeat the mistakes that I have,because now you are aware of them.On that note, Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
