Check one, two. Check one, two.Markets have down, markets...When markets go down...When markets go down,how should your investment strategy changeif at all it should be changed.We'll know it in this video.Again, I made it complicated.Whenever markets start going down,how should your investment strategy changewe'll know it in this video.Friends, the start of 2022was not that great.After two years of bull run,After COVID, seeing the damagesin the market, people thoughtwe are done. Then, after that,the market that grew for two years,no one could have predicted that.But, towards the end of 2021and the first part of 2022has been fairly choppy.Markets went down by 20, 25, 30 percent,so many stock, for the first time,I am seeing 80 percent negative,40 percent negative.And it is not something that I thinkmost of you would have seenin your investing journey.In this video, I want to sharethose tips and tricks with you,that seasoned, smart, wise investors useto navigate through beer markets.It's not just applicablefor what we're going through right now,but for any market.Where more than 20% correctionhas been done,That means markethas gone down more than 20%.First of all, the definition of recessionas I have told you, at anytimeif any market goes down by 20%or goes through correction,then it seems like a correction.That is not a recession.The meaning of recession is economyof a country or maybe the whole world,is growing negatively that means,it's degrowingfor two consecutive quarters.The last quarter, the US economy actuallydegrew by around 1.3% if I'm not wrong,so then if we get one more quarterof degrowth,that means negative growththen formally, officiallythe US is in recession and it that happensthen it may mean some very bad newsfor a prolonged period of time.India is still safe and we are one of thefastest growing countries in the world.There's a lot going on for us,but there's been a lot of correctionfrom our market too.And largely because of three thingsthat are happening globally.Ukraine, Russia warcreating clearly a energy crisisacross the worldand then we face political instability,China's supply issues because of COVID,Alot of chips supply fora lot of technology countries haveChina's COVID issuesbecause of its supply chain.China's COVID issuesbecause of supply chain issues.China's COVID issues because of whichsupply chain issues are happening.And a lot of technology companiesaren't able to get chips.And the third, because of COVID,particularly, the government of UShas printed a lot of dollars.So there is massive liquidity inter marketwhich is flowing inbut does not know where to flow in.Now with all of these three,we are caught in a very interestingeconomic situation called Stagflationand it's important to know before I sharethose tips and tricks, sotry to understand it very carefully,you want to be smart about thesethings, wouldn't you?What is stagflation?Stagflation is a period when there isno growth and very high inflation.That means economy isn't growing.Income isn't growing,but the rate of these thingsare growing rapidly.And that is the period,that we seem to be going in particularlybefore the US.And if US goes into stagflation,then it becomes a really hard situationbecause as surprising as it sounds,economists don't have a way,clearly, to handle stagflation.So what they tend to do isinterest rates on which banksgive loan to other banks and to us.They keep increasing it,so that we send less of our moneyand try to save more to get more interestbut that is the only way that they mostlyuse for containing inflation andhoping it fixes it may fix.May not fix.Long story short, in next one or two yearsmarkets might go through a choppy periodand you need to be prepared for that.How?Number one, save money.save as much money as you canas is it is inflation is increasingmeaning commodities are becoming expensiveSo whatever is it that you spendmoney on that is not needed.You're ending up spending a lot more moneyand the money left for you, for investingfor your future is getting less and lesserSo please over the next one to two yearsyou income might not increase very fastbut your savings and investment must growso do not spend lavishly on thingsthat you do not need immediately.Number two, invest regularly.we cannot time the marketmany people think that"this market will fall more and more".but while falling it starts raisingthen you are like "lets wait it will fall"You don't want to be doing thatYou're not experts.I am at least not an expert.so I do not try to time the marketI am very clinical about all my investmentThe only thing that I dothat if I have any excess cashthen I diploy more during this bear marketbeacuse I would know that I am gettinghigh quality investments at cheap pricewhether they are stocks, whether it's evendebt, whether it's anything else.we will talk about thatBut the best thing that you can dois regularly invest.Number three.If you have any Lumsum amountwheather it is from bonusremoving from FDIt is good that you removed FDbut why did you have it in the first placeNo worries, everyone does mistakesin big big countriesthese small mistakes happensIf you have some lumpsum amountthen you convert it into SIPdon't put all of that money in.you do not know how muchwill it fall or raiseSo my suggestion iswhat ever your lumpsum amount is60% out of that convert into 6 equal SIPkeep 40% asidewhenever a time comes where you feel"Yes the market is really down"so invest that 40% in one go as wellconvert your lump sum amountalso into SIP.Number four, invest safely.don't just invest in equitiesyou can take the riskthis is also the time to diversifytry to explore many other asset classesfor example, debt, fixed incomeCommodities like Gold, equities.a great way of doing that is small case.I invest in All weather investingthat in mu opinion is one of the beststarter investments tomake for anybody startingparticularly when it is down marketbecause what it has is a beautiful balancebetween these three thingsso if you see this, Gold is around 40%Equity is around 36%and Debt is around 26%So this is a very balanced approchbecause of this you will get stable returnso the four year Kaggar is 10.75which is pretty good.so you will get 11% in four yearsYou don't have to invest in thisfor the rest of your life.because 11% may not be enough.but for this period where youdon't know how down can equities can gowhat is happening with itwhat is the volatilityyou are far better off investingin something which is acombination of fixed incomeof commodities which are slightly moreor slightly less volatileand equities where there is volatilitywill be able to wait throughbecause 60% of allocationis somewhere else.this is a quartely rebalancemeaning this compostion is not staticthis compostion keeps changingevery three monthsyou will have to refreshthe combination, the best part about thisis that it is absolutely free.this is a free small casefrom All weather investingThe only charges that you will have to paywill be the brokerage charges that youwill have to pay at the end of your brokerwho ever it may beSo please invest safelyand diversify your risk.Number five, focus on the long term.this is not the period to earn overnightIn fact, no period should be to earnovernight, but particularly this period.can be very damagingbecause it is going to be very seductive.many people will tell you"This is the right time to earn money"because you can do swing tradingAs the market moves horizontallyyou can do intraday tradingyou can invest in options, futures.All of that, please do if you're an expertbut if you're notif you don't understand thatif you do not know how to do it,then don't.focus on long term investing onlyfocus on the returns thatyou can earn is 5,10 years, becausethis market is going to give youopportunity to create brilliant outcomesover the next five to ten years.because market is correcting nowmeans all the valuable expensive stockshave become reasonable now.and their growth is still continuingSo you don't want to miss out onthe future opportunity of all of thesegreat companies, whether it's standardFMCG companies in India, standardtechnology, IT companies in Indiastandard manufacturing companies in Indiaall these fundamentals are not vanishingonly it is down due to external conditionsthat means all of these valuable stocksover a long period of time.are going to give a brillent returnsif you have a long term approchNumber Six,if you already have some investmentsOf course, it might be in negetive.Please do not panic sell it.That is a rookie mistake to make.The only reasonwhy you should be selling your stocksright now is for tax harvesting purposes.I made a video on tax harvestingyou can watch how does it workBut that should, in my opinion, be theonly reason that you sell your stocksselling stock now means, you did notever believe how the stock market works.stock market by definition go up and downSo if you have been witnessing the lasttwo years rise, you were happy about itbe prepared for a two years of a down falland then it will raise back again.but when it does it will be on a levelheigher then where it was beforeHistorically, this has happened alwaysso you have no reason to believethat it will not be replicatedI know that, many people who are watchingthis is the first time that youseeing such negative returnsfor your investmentBut I have witnessed thatseveral times in my lifetime.in 2000,2007,2008, 2015, 2019, in 2020so all of these corrections are somethingthat you know are inevitable, but oncethe market comesback, it rises far aboveand that is what you have to wait forNumber Seven, don't invest in Fomomany people that advantage of this timewill try to give youwrong or seductive informationAlas, Bitcoin and Crypto are so cheapput money into themput but only that much you used todon't put it out of Fomobecause you think that you will makeit big and become rich overnightIt does'nt happensdon't make those mistakesDo not invest in penny stocks.If anyone says ''invest in this stock""you will get 40% returns in 3 days"don't do itEven if that happens, don't do it becausewhat you are doing is investing in FOMOand you don't want to be doing that.Wise invetors do not do Fomo investingFinally, if you are investing in Equitiesso do index investing instead of stockby index investing you invest in porfolioit could be small case as I toldAll weather investing is a great onebecause that is a porfolio of investmentthat you are putting in where it isin gold or debt or equities both largecap and midcap investment.So the risk will be mitigatedAnd similarly,you can also invest in index stockand similarly, you can alsoinvest in index or portfolio of stocksas against picking up one stock itself.You will find small cases with portfolioin small cases, where you canpick up ideas that you want to representyou want to bet on middle class of Indiayou can pick those stockscompanies that are buildingproducts for middle class Indiacompanies building for rural Indiacompanies that are only from house of Tatathat are only focusing on I&T or Pharmawhat ever it is you essentially are sayingI am not capable of picking a stockWhat I am going to do is pick a portfolioof stocks so that if one goes upand other goes downat the end I am still averaged outThere are the approchesthat I have personally followedevery single time when I came acrossa down market and correction.and I am sharing this experience with youso that you can benefit outof these experiences as I amI hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo signing off.
