I saythe word sapiens?I am not going to make it easy for you!Lucky 20 winners will geta copy of the book,and one lucky winner would getthese two books as free giveaways.Let's talk about what is Sapiensall about?This book is written byan Israeli historianby the name of Yuval Harari.It is a very simple yeta very impactful book.If you usually ask the questionwhat is the history of our civilizationand how is it that we have cometo this point?This book has the answer toa lot of those questions.It starts with a very fundamental thing,which we think is very obviousbut it isn't.Yuval says that 70,000 years back,the form of homo sapiens,which is the speciesthat we are called by,that's why the name Sapiens,when they were living on earth,then we were like any other species.Along with us, there were chimpanzees,orangutans, fish, several other species,and there was no difference between us.It wasn't like, homo sapiensrule the world,they are the most intelligent,and they are going to doso much in the world.No, nothing like that!We were just normal,insignificant in the words of Yuval.But if we look at today,then that's not the case.Something happenedin the last 70,000 years,because of which we have transformedfrom an insignificant species,to the most dominantand significant species on earth.And Yuval argues thatthat happened because of two things.Number 1: The power of humans to imagine.We can imagine.We can use that imaginationeither positively or negatively.Today when we imaginethat in our future lives,we would have a bungalow, a car,and all the luxuries.We imagine that we would go onthat vacatio.We imagine that we will loveso-and-so person.We imagine that all this willhappen in our lives.All of that is our power to imaginewhich animals lack.And I'll come back tohow this constructedthe most important thingwhich bonds this world.And the second thing that happenedwas our power to corporate.Though we think it doesn't happenin the world anymore,we are the only speciesthat can cooperate at scale.This means if you put together100 chimpanzees and 100 human beings,you may not see a lot of differenceat that point.100 people will achieve somethingby doing something or the other,it is possible that chimpanzeeswill also do it.They would also plan what to eat,which trees to climb,where to settle, and so on.But if you put togetherone lakh people and one lakh chimpanzees,then its quite possiblethat chimpanzees will be in utter chaos,but humans will still finda way to co-operate.And this cooperation happens a lot,even when the other person is a stranger.If you really think about it,we often work at the level ofcooperation itself.When you start your dayand step out of your home,you take an auto or a bus,that is a form of cooperation.Because you are trustingthat auto driver or that bus driverthat they will do their jobfor a sum of money,or some exchange of service,and you would still get what you wanted.That is a form of cooperation.You are on a road constructedby some stranger.Why?Because things came togetherand humans cooperated.These buildings, this infrastructure,these companies, this government,this country, all of theseare a reflection of cooperationthat animals lack.And in addition to the cooperationas I said it's our imagination as well.Our capability to imagine.And because of that imagination,we weave stories.We have the power to tell stories.We have the power to share stories,and thus we have the powerto create fictional constructs.We can create fiction through our stories.Here's an example.What is money, friends?It's a sheet of paper!Not even a sheet,it's a small piece of paper.It's a note on which the RBI Governorwrites that this is a â¹2000 note,and I guarantee that its value is â¹2000.Who is an RBI Governor?What is this money?And yet, whoever has that â¹2000 note,or â¹500 note, or â¹100 note,believes that they have that money.And with that belief, they go to a shop,give them the money,and the other person also givesthem a product with the same belief.If you really think about it,it is unbelievable how that works.The whole world operates like this.When you think about religion,no one has seen their God in any form,only felt them, and that is still fiction.A strong belief there issome superpower that has beencoming through ages,through generations,through civilizations,and has become a concrete truthfor ourselves.And that is the power of our imagination.So when you combine this imaginationand cooperation, things become magic,which is what Yuval says in this book,the Sapiens.Three revolutions are talked aboutin Sapiens.There was a cognitive revolution70,000 years ago,which established a new civilizationon the basis of this cooperationand this imagination,where homo sapiens began to emergeas the predominant species on this planet.Then 12,000 years ago,there was the agricultural revolution.When we wandered frommountain to mountain,river to river, city to city,there were no cities back then,for the first time we startedsettling because we knew how to grow food.Now we didn't just go to find food,we didn't pluck food,we didn't kill for food,we could grow food.And that led to the first settlements.And through that,a different revolution started.And 500 years ago,the third revolution which wasa scientific revolution,which still might be on.When humankind began to question things.They realized that they arefoolish and ignorant,they don't know anything,but through the principles of science,through the principles of physics,chemistry, maths, biology,we can understand the earth,nature, our biology,and this whole world,we can try to understand them.And that has led to the establishmentof everything that we see.There are so many thingsthat are imaginative.In our world, our life,money in a way is imaginative,religion in a way is imaginative,and the concept of companies.What is a company?If you buy something froma company or a brand,does it exist physically?No.Offices exist, but what doesa company mean?It's imaginative.So many things are drivenby our ability to imagineand to cooperate,which has led to this book,and the entire history of humankind,as it has been shared by Yuval.Brilliant book!You will really like itif you are a student of history,if you are a student of curiosity,if you are a student who lovesto get into the details of things.And Yuval has written this bookSapiens very simply,because I was reading inone of his interviews,and the first thing he said was,'I have not written anythingnew in this book.I am often surprised thathowcome this book became so successful,because everything thathas been written in this bookis something that the worldalready knows of.Nothing is new,nothing has come out of my own theory,'because he is a historian,he is not a scientist,he is not someone who isa sociologist or someone.He is somebody who just studies history.So whatever literature was alreadyavailable in the world,he collated all of it,and established it in this book,and that's why I absolutely love it.I also particularly likethe illustrated version,which is based on Yuval's book,but David and Daniel arethe two illustratorswho have illustrated this book.It comes in two parts.It's great if you want to giftthis to your kids,if you also want to know about Sapiens,because it might be a littledifficult to read this book,because it is very dense,and it is written in a fashionwhich also makes it very thick,but it's easier for us to read comics,and I would encourage youto pick that up as well.As I said, I am giving away20 books in this video,plus one of this illustrated edition.How?You have to tell me thathow many times did I saythe word sapiens in this video.And for all those who answerthis question correctly,20 people from them will berandomly selected,and they will get this bookplus one of the lucky winnerswill get the illustrated edition.I hope this was useful.A book review every
