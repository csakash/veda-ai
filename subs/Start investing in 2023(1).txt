If you invest your moneyand it grows at the rate of 15% annually,then it will double in around 3.5 years,which means two for one in 3.5 years,then two for four in the next 3.5 years,then four for eight in 3.5 years,and then sixteen for eight in 3.5 years.This means within 14 years,within just 14 years,you can make your money 16 times.Clearly, two things are neededto make money so big,one is time,and the other is the rate of interest,at what growth your cash is growingyear after year.In this video, I will tell you aboutthe investing strategy of 2023which you can adopt depending onat what growth rate you want to grow.But before that,3 things are very important.If you do not have these 3 thingsbefore starting any investment,then you are being stupid.Number 1: Term insurance.Probably your income is runningyour family,then the lives of many people dependon your income.God forbid if something happens to you,then they can be in trouble,hence term insurance.Term insurance ensuresthat if something happens to your lifeduring the term for which you have takenthat insurance,then your beneficiaries or nomineesget an amount.Whatever your annual income is,your insurance coverage should beat least 20 times and ideally 25 times.This means if your annual incomeis â¹5,00,000,then your cover should be â¹1 croreor ideally â¹1.25 crores,and this term insurance is the cheapest.Any other insurance plan, investment,endowment, ULIP, etc., will cost more,and if the coverage remains the same,the returns will also be less,and that is not something I recommend.Term insurance is what you have to go for.The second thing is health insurance.In the last 2-2.5 years, during Covid,so many familiesdid not have health insurance,and all of their savings were wiped outdue to hospital expenses.You don't want this to happen to you.If your parents are aged,they are getting old,if you have your own family,then health insuranceis extremely important.Even if you have got health insurancefrom your company,despite that take one of your own,because the day you leave that company,that health insurance will get lapsed,and it is a big hassle to transfer it.So take your own health insurance.Take a separate one for your parentsbecause that's more expensiveas they are old,and take another one for your familyand yourself because that will be cheaperas your possibility or probabilityof hospitalization is very less.Two health insurance,one for your parentsand one for yourselfis the right way to do it.And number 3: Emergency fund.God forbid if something happensto your income but for a short term.Maybe you are laid off,or you want to take a breakor go on a sabbatical,then you must have at least 6 monthsof expenses with you,ideally 12 months of expenses.So whatever are your monthly expensesfor your needs, not your wants,not to party or order in,only your needs like EMI, rent,food and electricity bills, fees, etc.,multiply all that by 6for your minimum emergency fund,and multiply by 12for your ideal emergency fund.If you don't have these 3 things,then you will not start any investing.So first of all, you have to getthese 3 things in order.After that,let's start our investing journey.First of all, we will talk aboutmy close friend, fixed deposit.Fixed deposit and I are such great friendsthat I keep bashing it every daybecause I am always super angry with it.A fixed deposit is great if youwant to lose your money risk-free.If you want your moneyto grow every year by some percentage,but inflation reducesthe value of that money,then a fixed deposit is for you.The usual rate of interestfor fixed deposit is 6% which meansyour money will double in 12 years.So if you have to increase your moneyby 16 times,and if your money is invested in FD,then it will take you 48 years!You can do that,but in 48 years, inflation,which means how fast the value of thingsis increasing, will destroy this money.So while a fixed deposit seems great,it should only be used if you wantto park your emergency fund there,because the emergency fundshould be protected.When you want to grow your money,you have to continuously beat inflation.Number 2: Gold.Everybody likes sleeping!No, not that!Actual gold,the gold that Bappi Lahiri wears!And we often consider goldas an investment,but there are 2-3 problems with gold.Number 1: If you are buying jewelryas an investment.Nice try!It's not!Investment is in the form of investment,not in the form of jewelry.Jewelry has making charges,problems of purity,conversion charges, and various things,and that's why it is not directly makingyour money grow.So if you want to invest in gold,which will give you around8-9% rate of return,which means your money will doublein around 8-9 years,then you should buy digital goldwhich is allowed on a lot of platforms.The best is Sovereign Gold Bonds,which is issued by the governmentevery quarter.As the rate of gold increases,you get that return which is 8-9%,but additionally,you will get 2.5% annually.Annually or absolute, I'm not too sure,please correct me in the comment section.You get 2.5% extra.I think it's on the total amountand not annually but I could be wrong,and this is a great way for you to invest.If you are not able to buy SGB directlybecause it gets sold out quickly,then it also has a secondary marketwhere there are a lot of playerswho allow you to buy SGBin a secondary market.WintWealth is an option that you can use.Then comes real estate.We all love real estate!We keep buying houses, shops, ATM,offices, so on and so forth,but a big problem with real estate is thatit needs a lot of money, right?â¹50 lakhs, â¹1 crore, or more,and if you buy for small amounts,then their rental yieldwill also not be that much,so it doesn't add up to a lot.So a great way to think about real estateis REITs, Real Estate Investment Trusts.These real estate companies convertthe rental income of their real estateinto a trust,and you can buy and sell thatin the stock market.So if you open your brokerage accountin the stock market,it could be through say Zerodha,I prefer Zerodha,it is India's number onebrokerage account company,and you can buy and sell there in REITs.It works exactly like a company's stock,but the difference will beinstead of buying a company,you will be betting on the rental incomeof real estate projects.There are 3 Real Estate Investment Trustsin India as of now.All three are into commercial real estate.A retail real estateis soon to be launched,which I am not sure when,but sometime in 2023.So it will be a great way for you to say,I believe in retail real estate more,so I will buy its stocks or its REITs.OrI believe more in commercialor office space, so I will buy that.But REITs are a wonderful way to dabble inreal estate for you to enjoy the growth.Next is corporate bonds.Corporate bonds are really interesting.They usually give between 9-12%,sometimes more, but they are also riskyso I will tell you how they work.Corporate bonds are the bonds ofthose companies that want to take a loan.There can be a lot of ways to take loans.They can ask banks for a loan,or they can go to retail investorslike us and ask for a loan,and that then becomes like a loanyou have given to a company.So the company will deploy that moneyin a project,pay the loan with the return generated,and also pay off the interest,and that is how you get a regular incomethrough your investment.If you are eager for a regular income,then corporate bonds are a great waybecause in a short period of 1-4 years,it generates a regular income throughyour investment.A great platform to buy corporate bondsfrom is WintWealth.Again as I said, WintWealth allows youto buy SGBs,and it also specializes in corporate bonds.Disclaimer: I am an investor in WintWealth,so I could be speaking with a biased opinion,but I buy my corporate bonds and SGBsfrom WintWealth only.Please do your own research and buyfrom wherever you want to.My preference and recommendationwould be WintWealth.The big risk in corporate bonds is,God forbid if something happensto the company, then all the money is lost.This is unlike stock.Stocks never goes down to 0 value,its value can decrease,but it doesn't go to zero.In this case, it could go to 0which is called default risk,and that is why there is a ratingfor corporate bonds.The best rating is AAA rating.This means that the rating agency says,the fundamentals of this companyare great,they're using the moneyin the right place,the money is guaranteed,it has collaterals,God forbid if something happensto the company then we can recoverthat money by selling these collaterals,so on and so forth,and that is why we give a high rating.My suggestion would be,whenever you buy a corporate bond,make sure it's AAA or AA rated.It would also mean thatthe rate of interest would be less,because you are taking lesser risk,so you will get lesser returns.But you should get about 9-10%,which means your money will doublein around 7 years,and that is a good way for youto start investing in 2023.Next is mutual funds.We have often heard about mutual funds.Mutual funds are actually a good wayto enter the stock market,because through mutual fundsyou can capitalizeon the growth opportunitiesof the stock market.You don't have to put in your research,your brains, and your expertise,and frankly, we don't even have that,so we will rely onsomebody else's experience and expertise,and that is why mutual funds.In mutual funds, you buy a bouquetor portfolio of stocks,that is multiple stocks,but the mutual fund is managed bya manager who takes up allthe responsibilities and expenseson your behalf to give you the returns.For this, they charge something calledthe expense ratio.Expense ratio means whatever moneyyou invest in the mutual fund,how much percentage of it will they useto run the mutual fund.Typically this could be anywhereas low as 0.5% to may be at high as 2%.If you give â¹100, they will charge â¹1to run the fund, and invest â¹99.Here is where you should thinkabout mutual funds.Mutual funds can be taken fora lot of things.You can buy index mutual funds whichmap an index or a portfolio of stocksthat are tracked in Indiaas a legit tracker.The best-known index isthe Nifty 50 index.The Nifty 50 index tracks India's top50 companies.So in the National Stock Exchange,the top 50 companies and their ratio,depending on their size,like Reliance is a big companyso its ratio would be higher,let's say HDFC is a small companyso its ratio would be lesser,so on and so forth,so you can buy these stocks in that ratio,and that will bea Nifty 50 index mutual fund.These are called large-cap mutual funds,which means they invest in companieswhich are huge.Similarly, there are mid-cap mutual fundsthat invest in medium size companies,and small-cap mutual funds that investin small size companies or industries.The difference is in the risk.And risk means volatility.It doesn't mean that your moneywill be lost,it means how rapidly will your moneyfluctuate.Large-cap companies have low volatility,which means there is nota lot of fluctuation,but it is still there.The volatility is higherin mid-cap companies,and the highest in small-cap companies.But over a period of time 5-10-15 years,you will see that all three havean upward trend.In fact, small-cap grows the most,followed by mid-cap,followed by large-cap.Why?Because the risk is totally opposite.You will get more returnwhen you take more risk,and less return when you take less risk,just like a fixed deposit.So an ideal mix for 2023, probablythere would be a recession,maybe markets will be shaken up,it will be 65% of your moneyin the Nifty 50 index which willensure that most of your money isin a relatively stable index fund,then 25% in a mid-cap index fund,and then 10% in a small-cap index fund.I am not naming anyone,because there is no preference.Usually, HDFC, SBI are the biggest ones,but it's your choice,do it with your research.I have made a lot of videoson mutual funds.I have also made a video called'Index tracking error',please check it out.How closely can a mutual fund trackan index?The closer the better,and that is what you have to go with.But this will be the split,65-25-10in large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap.And then finally, Smallcase.There are a lot of portfolios of stocksthat are not represented by mutual funds.For example, you want to beton middle-class India,and you feel that the companiesmaking services and productsfor middle-class India will growexponentially in the next 10-20 years.Unfortunately, there is no mutual fundas yet which invests in the companiestargeting middle-class India,but there is a smallcase for this.Now, what is a smallcase?Smallcase is basically like a mutual fundbut not a mutual fund,where an independent finance professionalcreates a portfolio of stocksand you can subscribe to that smallcase.Smallcase is a product withwhich you connect your brokerage account,wherever it is, whether on Zerodha,or Upstox, or 5paisa, blah blah blah,and through only three clicks,you are able to replicatethe entire portfolioin your Demat account.You will buy those stocks,you will sell those stocks,whatever is suggested by the smallcase,but it will happen through yourDemat account,which is what I find most efficientabout it because I have total ownershipof that and total visibilityof that at all points.Smallcase's best starting small caseis All Weather Investing.All Weather Investing invests inequities, gold, and fixed-incomeor debt instruments.So because of these three things,as the name suggests,All Weather Investing,whether the market is up or down,you are insulated in a way,because when the stock market is up,usually gold stays stable,if the stock market goes down,gold kind of saves it,and debt gives you a regular fixed income.So, All Weather Investing is a good start.So, 65% of your smallcase moneyin All Weather Investing.Then 25% in sectoral smallcases,as I said,middle-class India is a great sector,I would want to bet on that.Rural India is a great sector,I would want to bet on that.Pharma is a good sector,I would want to bet on that.Infra is a good sector,I would want to bet on that.So all these smallcases are available,where you can with your expertiseand your choice,buy the portfolio of stocksof the industries you like the best,and they of course will be managedby someone who knows their stuff.And then 10% into somethingwhich gives youa high-risk-high-return opportunity.So my preference would be somethingcalled momentum strategy.I have created a lot of contentabout the momentum strategy,but basically, momentum strategy iswhen a stock price is on a rise,it is seen that it rises withthe momentum before it starts falling.So you take a bet on the period of rise,and that is called a momentum strategy.The best thing about momentum strategy isthat it is picking up winnersat all points in time.It will invest in the oneswhich are performing,and do away with the non-performers.I had an amazing conversationon momentum strategy recentlywith Alok who is the founderof Weekend Investing,and he runs multiple smallcaseswhich are really profitableand give high returns.I am their customer,so I am biased in that opinion,but I have personally experienced itand I know and I can vouch for that.So 10% in momentum which could be anyof the momentum strategies.My recommendation would beWeekend Investing.These are all the ways in whichyou can start your investing journey in 2023.To give you a flavor of the return comparison.Fixed deposit, around 6%.Gold, around 8-9%.Real estate, same, around 8-9%.Corporate bonds, between 9-12%.If you go for mutual funds, large-capusually gives you 10-12%,mid-cap gives you 14-16%,and small-cap gives you16-20% annual return.Similarly in Smallcase,All Weather Investing gives youbetween 10-12%,if you go for sectoral,then anywhere between 12-14%,if you go for momentum,then it could be anywherein the range of 16-20%,perhaps even upwards.To find out in how many yearsyour money will double,you have to divide 72by this rate of return.If you have invested your moneywhere its generating a 20% return,then your money will start doublingin 3.5 years, but if you have investedin an instrument where your moneyis growing by 10%,then your money will double in 7 years,and to get to that 16 times number,you will know how many years you'll need.Two things are vital for investing,time and rate of return.If you are able to track these two things,then you are on your way to startinga wonderful 2023.Ankur warikoo, signing off!If you invest your moneyand it grows at the rate of 20% annually,then it will be doubledin around 3.5 years,which means two for one in 3.5 years,then two for four in the next 3.5 years,then four for eight in the next 3.5 years,and then sixteen for eightin the next 3.5 years.This means within just 14 years,you can make your money 16 times.So to multiply your money so quickly,you need two things,one is timeand another is a rate of return,and these things are available to you.In this video, I will share allthe instruments with youwhere you can invest your money,and according to their rate of return,how many years it will take youto double your money,we will get to know in this video,but before that,3 things which are extremely important.
