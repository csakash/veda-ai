That...Basically, what are the few stocksthat will emerge?That emerge through Benjamin Graham's,the author of this book, principles.This book was published in 1970s.Let me check it, it was in 1970s.Intelligent Investor release date.Oh shit, 1949. Thank God.This book was published in 1949,and it's still valid the same as then.Yes, of course. A lot of things changed.The biggest thing that has happened isthe pace at which information hits us.In earlier days, about stock marketabout companies performance,we got to know it in thenewspaper everyday.Quarterly results got published.Twenty four hours, every second,you get one information or the other.If you are on Twitter,if you are on money control,if you are on TV,then you are getting some newsfrom somewhere.And that is why this books becomeand that is why this book becomesso much more important,because in this book,the author has spokenabout my favorite ideology,and that is patience.Let's talk about the five key takeawaysin this book.First one, understandthe concept of market.And this Mr. Market...First, understand the concept of market.Market is a very strange thing.In the stock market,every company's price of the stock,it keeps going up and down.If there's a bad news, it goes down.If there's a good news, it goes up.and it keeps going on.So it gives us the feeling perpetuallythat we need to stay alert.And the intelligent investor'sfirst principle is thatdo not fall for that trap.With the kind of price that this marketfluctuates the stock market.That may not be the true reflectionof the value of the company.So the first principle is that thevalue is not equal to the price.Let me give you an example.I am shooting this video on 23rd May, 2022and in the past one month,the tech stocks of the US stock market,had been beaten up so badly, so badly,that it reminded me of the year 2000.Let's pick up Tesla.Tesla, wow, electric vehicle, Elon Musk,the company that will change the worldhas lost 40% in the last few weeks.What has happened?The company's standard, company's valuethe worth of the company has fallen by 40%in just a few weeks.No, but something has changed.It could be a combination of the investorsof Tesla getting confused,that Elon Musk is wastinghis brain purchasing the Twitter,Handle Tesla first.That is a big company in itself.It is of course the global crisisthat is happening.Ukraine-Russia war,China's supply issues,liquidity is massive in the market.So on and so forth.It could be just a wave thatit was costly anyway.It's a good thing that it's falling.So, people are also sellingbecause they're booking their profits.Anything can happen.And that should be a great wayfor you to realizethat whatever the price you are payingit's not necessary thatthe value of the company is the same.And that's the fundamental principlethat this book teaches us.The second one,Benjamin Graham says thatthere are two types of investors.One, who are defensive investorswhom they call passive investors.Actually, passive investorswhom he calls defensive investors.And then there are others aggressive,or active investors.And the approach of both of themis very differentbut then the returns and risks of bothare also very different.Like you and I, we would be classicdefensive or passive investors.Because we don't have expertise,we don't have time,we don't have the understandingthat we actively trade.And until you don't get to that point,my recommendation will not beto do it as well.So defensive or passive investorsapproach should be very different.It has to be one with a lot of patience.It has to be one with a lot of screeningand it has to be onewhich understandsthat you are giving true valueof a company.Graham Bell. Graham Bell?Benjamin Graham,Graham Bell was someone else.Benjamin Graham does a few stepsIt went wrong again.Benjamin Graham has...Benjamin Graham illustrates a few steps,for us to find the true valuable companieswhich we are going to usein the later part of the videogo through an Excel sheetand find out that how does it applyon the Indian Stock Market.Now, I'll read and Aditya, you'll have togive a certain,like show the illustration on screen.Number one,the principle of a passive investorshould be diversification.Because you don't know in which industry,in which stock should you invest inyou have to diversify,or you should diversify,so that you could mitigate your risk.Second, your ratio investment,that should be well-understood.How much do you want to put in equity?How much do you want toput in fixed income?For example, there's a 100-X rule,which says if your age is X,so the X percentage of your investmentgoes to fixed income.These can be corporate bonds,it can be gold, maybe fixed deposits too,but I would not recommend.And 100-X is in your equity.And then you haveto keep looking at that ratio.to keep balancing it.It's a clear thing that the equityover a long period of timegives more return than fixed income.So, it's possible that youhave started with 50-50 rupeesbut as you grow because equity was growingtoday it's value has become70% of your investment,and 30% is only fixed income.And your age has also increased.So you have to look at that X andrebalance this portfoliowhich is what Benjamin Graham suggests.Then a few factors of selecting the kindof investment thatyou should make in equity.They say invest in large companies,they say invest only in those companieswhose debt is less.They say there should be a minimumannual growth rate of three percentof the profit.It appears less for a market like India.But, we'll take it.That might be enough in 1949.Annual return should be three percent,atleast from the last five yearsof the profits.Price to earning ratio,that means what's the stock price,and what's the earnings per share?That ratio should be less than 15.Which means, that earning is good,price is still a little less,so, possibly it's a valuable asset.And then finally he sharedvery interesting formula which is ofwhat is the definition of a cheap asset?He says, that if market capitalizationof a stock which is thatwhat is the total worth,of the stocks in the market,so whatever the number of stocksinto the share price of the stock,we can find market capitalization figurevery easily.And I'll show you how it's happened.That should be lesserthan one and a half timesasset minus liabilities.That means whatever the company's assetsall those things withwhich income can be generated.And all the liabilites,all the money they have to pay others,if you multiply it's difference 1.5 timesthen the market capitalization has tobe lesser than that number.According to him, according to Benjamin,if this formula works, thenmost likely the asset that you're buyingis a valuable yet cheap asset.And that's what he keeps stressing upon.Your focus as a passive investoris to find assets which are valuable,but they are cheap right nowfor whatever reasons.And that is when you buyat the right price,then just you wait for the longest timefor it to give you a return.On the other hand,principle number three ishow do you become an active investor?To become an active investor,atleast I don't have the capacity,you have to have again, a lot of patience.Because, it's not thatwhatever money you got,you put it today itself.Benjamin doesn't refer to intraday tradingas active investing.He says, active investor is somebodywho is hooked onto this gameday in and day out,he's reading company financials,he's meeting company representatives,he's, of course, gathering news fromindustry sources, for which he'sestablishing his own research and formula.What is the definitionof cheap valuable assets?He's trying to determine thatso on and so forth.So that is the way thatyou go about actively investing.However, that also meansthat you require a lot of knowledge,a lot of time, and you're alsowilling to take on a lot more risk.Because it might happen thatyou get so much attached to your research.That not everything will workand some things will fail disastrously.Some things will go andgive you super normal results.And that is where you are willing togo through the volatility,the up and down of your portfolio,and have the patience to withstand it.Alot of people, for example,for the first time,are looking at a negative trendin the market.2022 has not started on a good note,it is massively red and it's possiblewhatever investmentsthat you made in last two years,now, it's slowlybecome zero or maybe negative.and that is not something thatalot of people understand very well.So, if it's the first time in your life,that you are looking at a negative return,how you react to that is going to shape upyour relationship with moneyfor the rest of your life.Because everyone likes seeing gains,it's slowly increasing,the return is great, everybody likes it.But when you are in losses,how you react shapes uphow you're going to continue investingfor the rest of your life.Number four, insist on somethingcalled safety...Number four, insist on somethingcalled margin of safety.Benjamin says every investmentshould have a margin of safety,that means whenever you are investing,you know that the risk your are takingit's something you are comfortable with.I think the best example of thatis what happened in crypto.Last two years, crypto was growingon some other wave.2022 in the first few months,that wave has stoppedand started to go back.Alot of people's crypto portfolioswent negative.But the reasonwhy they invested in the first placeis not very well established.In fact, almost a lot of people,started investing in cryptobecause of FOMO.They thought they can becomerich overnightBut they never asked the questionwhat's the margin of safety in this?Am I okay with thistotal amount that I've invested?Go to zero.Am I okay for it to lose50, 60, 70% of value.And if the answer was no.Then ideally you should not have investedBecause crypto is by definitiona volatile asset.And yes, over a long period of timegains can come your way butto reach there the losses you have to bearthey maybe very hard for you to deal with.And it may not even be advisablefor you to go through thatI've said it a lot of times,your crypto investment should befive and maximum 10%of your total investment.But, I know a lot of people,who have put their entire investmentin crypto. Now they are crying.Because they didn't go throughthe concept of margin of safety,which is what is important.This is a very interesting formula,Benjamin shared aroundthe margin of safety.He says true value of a company...He says true value of a companyis equal to, I am reading it,the current earnings,whatever the current profit is,into 8.5 plus two timesthe expected annual growth rate.That means, if company, imagineexpected annual growth rate is 10%.So, two into annual growth rate expectedthat means 10%, which becomes 20,if you multiply it with 8.5, so 8.5 plus..Okay, remove this example,And how do we find this value?by the principlethat was shared earlierwhich I'll show you now in the video.And last and the fifth principleof this brilliant book,the intelligent investor is thatrisk and reward, it's not necessary,they are correlated.And this again goes back to valueBenjamin was sure about one thingthat he tried to put in our brainsagain and again through this book.That to generate returnyou don't have to much risk.You have to look for value,at a cheap price.And if you are able to find valuable assetat a cheap price.You are actually not taking a lot of risk.The example that he gives isimagine if you want to buysomething worth $100,and that, for whatever reason,today you are getting it for $60.It's great. It's value is $60,it's worth is $100.so, at some point of time,you can buy this 60,and earn $100.But, if the same asset,you are able to buy at $40,then is that riskier?And the answer is no.It is just about findingthat how can I buy somethingworth $100 at $40?Is there any $100 entity itemcompany, price, stockthat's available at $40?And if it is, then I havea way to make 40 into 100without taking more risk.And that is how he thinks aboutrisk and reward.It's very fascinating and simple concept.I have often said that risk and reward arecorrelated. That for more return,you have to take more risk.But Benjamin goes about sayingit's not always true.And his best studentWarren Buffett has proved this alot.by patiently waitingfor the best companies to turn valuableand then to make mega investmentsand just sit on themfor the rest of your life.Come, let's see through an excel sheet,how does this actually workin real life in the Indian context?Okay, let's see Loom.Recording.So, to apply Benjamin Graham's principlesof value we'll use tick a tip,and we'll go to something calledstock screener.Basically, all the listed stock in India.It's the data of everything.And let's go througheverything one by one.So first of all, Benjamin Graham says,that you need to diversify,now we had diversified, stock universe,we'll update all the stock, okay?So, we are looking at everything,then they talk about large companies,I won't go to large companies now.Let's try and see all the companies.small cap that means small capitalization,mid capitalizationand large capitalization,we'll look at all of it.We don't need a closing price now,it doesn't matter to us now.We need P ratio, so he says P ratioshould be less than 15,we won't take negative,negative meansthat it's earnings are negative,That means it's not profitable now,so, we'll start with zero.And you'll say, I need a maximum of 15.If it's more than 15,then according to Benjamin,it's not a cheap asset.Okay, great. As you see, this numberkeeps changing, which is very interesting.For example, if I reset this,we started with 4435 companies.Now, as soon as I make it zero,then it becomes 3000,that means other companiesare not profitable.And if I make it 15,then this 3000 becomes just 1000.That means there's just 1000 companieswhose PE ratio is less than 15.Then it says it should have low debt.How do we see low debt?We'll try to take debt equity ratio.So, here is debt to equity.We'll add it. And...Let's say, it's a little difficult.Ideally, the debt equity ratioshould be 50%, that means...Whatever the companies equity isit's debt is 50%.But, let's say, we consider it 100%1078 is done, now 814.That means there are only 814 companies,whose PE ratio is less than 15.And the debt ratio is less than 100%.Debt is lesser than theequity in the company.Then he says,'Earnings has grownat least 3% annually,'so let's add.And let's add.Five year historical.Here it is, where did it go?So, we'll see five year historical.And we'll see what should we dowe don't need negativebecause we don't need a degrowing company.We need atleast 3%.It could be a lot more.Suddenly, there's just 520 companies left.Okay, now slowly, we are coming to theactual filter.Then we need which is the interestingthing that they said.Asset minus liabilities' 2.5 times shouldbe less than the market cap.Asset minus liabilitiesis called net worth.But with net worth,I don't think there's...No. Okay, let's considerassets and liabilities separately.Then we'll play with the excel sheet.It's fun anyway.So, let's go to total assets.Here it is, total assets.And then we'll take total liabilities too.Liabilities. Here, total liabilities.Perfect, okay. There's only 520 companies.We've taken it all.And then let's export this data.Let's see what we get. Perfect. Export.And then open it up. Okay. Excel sheet.It's open and it's done.Let's go and see, oops. Okay.Alright. We'll add a filter to it.Cool. So, these are all our...We'll try to make it look good now.So, look at this. Okay.Alright, perfect.Now, we'll do A minus L,which we need to do asset minus liability.So, asset minus liability, okay?This is our number,why did we give it so much value?Okay, asset minus liability.So, here we have asset minus liability.then we ask.If it's cheap or not,which is the main thing,So, we say if the market cap,which is this numberis less than 1.5 into this number,then it is cheap, otherwise it is not.Okay, and we'll do this now.Now let's look at what is it.If I go and say yes, sosuddenly I get all of these yes. Assets.Okay.And how many are there?324.So, today in India,there are 324 such companies.Whose PE ratio is less than 15.That means, in India,there are 320 such companies,whose PE ratio,means Price to Earnings ratio,is less than 15.It's annual profit growth,was more than 3 percent,which is very lessbut let's assume it's more than 3%.2.5 times of it's assets minus liabilitiesis more than market cap.Which is great so it's net worth into 1.5times more than market cap.And debt or equity ratio is less than 100.If you look at all of this, nowit is a questionthat how would you want to take it.Now, what I would do, it's mine,as he told to invest in large companiesI'll invest in large companies.So, I will say7,500 crores, that meansmore than 1 billion dollars,I don't want to do it.And you will see,ultimately there are onlyeight such companies.ONGC, GAIL, Bajaj holding, NMDC,Aurobindo Pharma, Oil India Limited,NISCL and EID Parry.Only these are the companies,that fulfill all of these qualifications.So if you were to followBenjamin Graham's principlethen what he would say isin all these companies,you can invest in that market cap ratio.and forget it.Rebalance after six months or 1 year,again do all of these things.that have been removed from itremove it.The thing that got added, then add it.and that is how you are going to representthe intelligent investoras defined by Benjamin.Okay let's see thatwhat are such things in this,that may not fit. I am just...That is the book reviewand the excel sheet.I hope this was useful.That is the book reviewand the excel sheet.I hope this was usefulThrough this, please don't say thatyou don't want to read.You have to read books,if you are interested in this.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.And if you want to read books,then Cuckoo FM in your favorite language,is available for you.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.And done.
