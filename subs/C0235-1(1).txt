Check 1 2 okLet's make the backlight blueOkWhen I say that your stock investingwill grow by 12% every year then youwill understand the magic of compounding,so what does it even mean?In this video, I will show you howcompounding works in the real life,using an excel sheet!Friends in this video I will try to gointo the details of compounding.One of the biggest problems incompounding is that we simplify it a lot.I am also guilty of it.Very often I tell you that if you invest â¹500every month  in your 20s, then just wait and watchthat when you are 50-60 years oldyour money will be in crores.Why? Why because of compounding.And then you say, 'Yes, but what is it exactly?How does compounding even work?What is the basic form of compoundingwhich we see in real life becausethe stock market is fluctuating all the timethen what is it that is being compounded?'I will clarify all that in this video usingan excel sheet and going deep into it.First of all, what is compound interestand why is it magical?Friends, the basic fundamental ofcompound interest is that you are growingby a certain growth rate but the biggestdifference is that the growth rate isestablished at a new base.What does that mean?You have started with â¹100,when you started with â¹100,let's say your growth rate is 10%.So, in the first year, you had â¹100,at the end of the year, you got a 10% growthso now how much do you have? â¹110.Now in the next year when you getanother growth of 10%, that will beon the new base of 110.It will not be calculated on â¹100,it will now be calculated â¹110.This means your money grew by 10% onlybut instead of â¹10 this year you earned â¹11,which means now your new base isâ¹110 plus 11 which is 121.Now again in the next year you grew by 10%,so the growth rate remains the samebut the base is changing,now you will earn 10% on â¹121,which means you are earning â¹12.1,and that means for that one year,you would be on 121 plus 12.1 which is 133.1,so on and so forthIf you look at it every year,your growth rate remains the samewhich is 10% but what you are actuallyearning is increasing.In the 1st year you earned only â¹10,in the 2nd year you earned â¹11,in the 3rd year you earned â¹12.1, and so on.If I try to show this in an excel sheetthen how will it look?So we have started with â¹100and every year we had a growth rateof 10%. We will do this twenty times.So in the first year how much did you grow?100 into 10% which is â¹10,and after this growth how muchmoney do we have? 100 plus 10 which 110.Now we started our next year with this â¹110So now if we take growth on thisThen see what happensWow! Magic!Let me just put it into a nice happyAlrightNow see what happensYour income has grown by only 10%but you started with a base of 100,next year your base was 110,and this is how your money got added.In the first year you earned â¹10,then 11, then 12, then 13, then 15,then 16, then 18, then 20, then 21, all this way.Now let me take it for up to 45 yearsThis is what we haveAnd let us plot this curveand see what happensSo we will insert and plot a line curve,so you can see it is going this way,let me try to take it a little moreWe will take it till 200OkAnd then we will go upNow let me try to plot this thingSo this is how it feelsNow the reason I wanted to show you is,look at the difference betweenOkNow I wanted to see the differencebetween these two chartsWhen I plotted the curve for 45 years,then this curve went like this.This is called an exponential curveA curve that goes like this is called exponentialBut you can see that it isgrowing every year very nicelyand it reached thereIf I do the same thing at 200 thenfor the longest time, can you see,almost till 125 129,it seems it is not growing only.It's absolutely flatBecause it takes off in a super speedThis is the reason our mind doesn'tunderstand compounding completelybecause if you are in your 20sand I told you that every monthconsistently invest â¹500-1000,whatever is possible, you will notexperience the power of compoundingfor a really long time, because forthe first 10 years it will be likethis flat curve. You would be growingevery month but it will feel flat.Only after you have spent 15-20 years,you will see a big jump,that it will blow your mind.Why? And this is the secondimportant part of compounding.Because our percent is not changing,it is 10% only, you can see it'salways 10% but because the base is changing,you will see that the quantum of growthor the increase in your wealth every month,every year, whatever is that period,that will continuously keep increasing manifold.So the increase is not dependent on the base.If you invest â¹1000This got a little complicatedI will start againWhen I said why because it is a second important partAnd that is because of your growth ratewhich in our case we have assumed to be 10%,it doesn't depend on your base.However big your base maybeif you can have 10% growth thenyou will get that much you only.What does this mean?You bought a stock worth â¹100on the first day and you got 10%so you want â¹10. Now you make alot of money so you got stocks worth â¹1 lakh,and you can still on 10% on itbecause the stock is the same, right?If you bought stock worth â¹100and it grew by 10%, then the same stockwill also grow on your â¹1 lakh investment,which means if it grows at 10% on â¹1 lakh,then you get â¹10000.Suppose you have huge amounts of moneyand you bought stock worth â¹1 crore,same stock, now that stock is growingby 10% for everybody, it won't be likeit will grow by 10% only for poor or cheap investorsand less for rich investors, no,it's the same growth which meansif you got 10% growth on â¹1 croreworth of stock, you will get â¹10 lakhs.And this thing will keep growingNow this seems theoreticalYou may think about what happensin real life, which is what I wantedto show you with actual databecause this will prove how all thisthat I showed you, all this is actuallytheory and in real life, it's a totallydifferent experience with the same result.Let's seeSo friends you can see a little intimidatingExcel sheet on the screen, but themost important Excel sheet tounderstand compounding. These are thereturns of Nifty which is theNational Stock Exchangemonth on month on month from theyear 2000 all the way to the year 2020.This means how much return did Niftygive every month for the last 20 yearsif you would have invested in Nifty.This is not for a particular stockbut for the whole index, I think this is Nifty 50if I am not wrong, which means top50 Nifty stocks but it doesn't matter,I just want to show you how it works.What you will see is different colorsThey are color-coded bymonths that gave good returnsand months that gave bad returns.For example, in the year 2000,if you would have invested in Januarythen you would have got a growth of 4.44%,7% in February, in Marchit would have gone down by 7.64%,in April it would have gone down further by 7.98%,it went further down in May,went up in June, went down in July,went up in August,went down in September and October,went up in November, went down in December,what's happening here?But this is how the actual world behavesIt is never a straight lineThis beautiful chart that I haveshown you, is not real life.Real-life is very very differentwhich we will plot and show youhow it works, but this is whathappens in real life.Despite that there is compoundingand I will show you how it works.This is the annual return which meansif you would have invested atthe beginning of the year thenby the end of the year how muchreturn would you have got?Surprisingly, actually not surprisingly,in 2000 and 2001 they had negative returns,which means if you would have investedthen you would have lesser moneythan your original investment,which is what you may know ifyou have made bad investments in life.But how does this actually work in real life?So we will start with an exampleI have plotted thisSuppose we had investedâ¹10000 in Jan 2000At the end of February,those â¹10000 became â¹10702.Why? Because we got a growth rateof 7.02% in Februaryby investing in the market.Then in March, those â¹10702became â¹9884 becauseI don't know how to say 84 in HindiSo in March, it went down by 7.64%,so you were at â¹9900Then you were at â¹9100Then at â¹8900Then it went upThen down, then up again,Then down, again down, then up again,Then down, and that is how you did it.But in December 2020 you were at â¹8170And then in Jan, it went up to â¹8870Why? Because in Jan 2001market went up by 8.56%So this is how I plotted all the numbersThis Excel sheet is uploaded,you can check it outIt is a very simple Excel sheetbut is beautiful in how it showsyou how compounding works!After doing all this,and you look at the annual returns,-14 -16 371% return! In one year!Then 10%, then 36, then 40, then 54,then a drop of 51% in 2008when the financial crisis happenedThen 75, 17, -24, 27, all this waySo you will see how it works andafter doing all this, â¹10000that invested in Jan 2000, that is nowâ¹92664Let meâ¹92664, you started with â¹10000 as your base.NowThe way people will sell youcompounding is 20 years backyou invested â¹10000, today theyhave grown up to â¹92664, so how much is itsCompounded Annual Growth Rate, CAGR?And when you do that calculation,the calculation is basically,your resultant amount which is â¹92000divided by your actual amount whichis â¹10,000 to the power 1 dividedby how many years, which is 20 yearsminus 1 because you aretaking out a percentage.And this comes to 12. sorry, 11.78%This means and it is a most important thingThis means that somebody is simplifying it andtelling you that either you understandthat your â¹10000 will be sometimes8 or 6 or 7000 or 12000 or 13000 or 25000,at the end of the year,or you understand that these â¹10000will grow by 11.78% every year comfortably.That is what is the lie or the oversimplification.To prove it to you, let's do thisWe will do 10000 into 1 plus whateveris a growth rate, so it comes out to be 178.So we will keep compounding on this,so 1 plus again the same thing,and if you take this down thenit comes out to be...We'll do this again because it was for 10000So, to show this, the white way todo that is, we started with 10000,at the end of the year those â¹10000will be, 1 plus our growth rate,which is â¹11178, now we will keepincreasing this, compounding this,So, 1 plus, and then we go here,and then if we drag it below then 92664Exactly same figureNow this is the realityThe reality is that your moneywhen you invest it in the stock marketor any risky asset, it goes throughits ups and downs.So, what you can actually see isyour â¹10000 are behaving like this,but in realityâ¦So, when you see a video of mine,then you would think that your moneywill grow like this, 10000 will become 11178,then it will become 12494,so on and so forth, but actually,your money will not behave like this,so let me plot this and we'll showwhat it looks like and this will bea nice happy smooth curve, right?It's a really nice curve but in reality,the curve will be like this.And that is what is the difference my friendsOne curve is very smooth and is always growing,and another curve is very choppy,but ultimately reaches the same pointwhere this curve reaches.So when you think about compounding,when you understand what is themagic of compounding,the magic is dealing with this.To deal with this uncertaintyis the magic of compounding.This is why I repeatedly tell you that,please do not expect a curve like this.Don't think that if your stock in fixed depositDon't think that if you are investingin a stock in the stock market,then it will keep growing in thesame way every year, or sinceI assumed in the Excel sheetthat the compounding rate ormy annual return will be 12%,no, it will be like this andyou will just have to keep invested.You will just have to stay invested.And that is how compoundingwill ultimately work for you.I hope this was usefulI hope that a lot of people get to watch thisIf you benefited from this,then please share this video in your circle,comment on it, like it,because that's how many more peoplewould be able to understand thisbig difference of compoundingand will be able to appreciate how it works.This Excel sheet is pinned in the descriptionIf you have any other questionson compounding, please ask meIt will be a pleasure to help you allAnkur Warikoo, signing off!
