You are reading a new book. Or you aredoing a new project.Learning something new.And every day,you are consuming something. Consuming information. Consuming new content. And you are scared that, âHow will I remember it?ââHow do I remember it?ââWhen it is needed, how will I know when did I read it?âAnd that is a very real problem.In this video, I want to shareIn this video,I want to share a simple butpowerful technique with youthat you can use to make sure thatwhatever informationyou are processing in your mind, at the right time,you can use it.You can makesomething out of it.And the basis of this video is Tiago Forteâsamazing course âBuilding a Second BrainâBuilding a Second Brainis a popular course whereTiago tries to teachhow along with your main brain, you can makea new brainthrough which, at any time, however you wish,you can access any information.And its principledepends on 3-Cs.Capture.Connect. And Create. Today,we will try to understand them. But to understand them,we will use an example so that an idea ofhow it is applied is also understood.And I am going to usethe example ofreading a book.When we read a book;whether itâs a school book or a college bookor a book for officeor a book for entertainment.We are always scared that,âHow will I memorize this book?ââWhen I need it,this new conceptthat I am learning, how will I apply it?âAnd through the 3-C method of building a second brain And through the 3-C method of building a second brain, of capturing, connecting and creating,we can actuallyestablish it. The first one.Capture.Whenever you are accessing any information, and in our example,you are reading a book, then in that book,most important informationcapture isreally necessary. Let me show youhow I do it.I read all my bookson Kindle.The best feature on KindleThe best feature on Kindle is that it allows you to carrymultiple books at the same time.But the best feature for me is, it allows me to highlight a book.Whenever I want. Whatever I want.However long I want.So, I donât need a physical highlighter.I donât need physicalpen and paper.While reading on Kindle,any sentence that I like,any paragraph that I like,any chapter that I like, any concept that I like,any diagram that I like, I can highlight it.And that becomes a electronichighlight that I can access,which we will talkabout in the next C.This becomes a way ofThis becomes a wayof capture.Now, how wouldyou use it in your life?Suppose yousee something on Instagramor read something on Twitter, read something on LinkedInor read something in an article.You basically need a notes creator. It could be Evernote. It could be Notion.It could be any one of themany tools and apps availablewhich allows you to highlightsections of an article or share the entire article or save the entire article or save the tweet or save the link so that you can capture it.And the most important thing is that you capture them in a single destination. It shouldnât be likepart of the informationis in notebooks,part of it is in your cupboard, part of it isin your kitchen, part of it is in your mind which you tried to remember because then the capture mechanism is failing.Our brainstores all its informationin a single place, right.And thatâs whyaccessing it does not take time.The same way,while creatingyour second brain, only one centralcapturing entity must be madewhere everything will reside. So, for me,while reading a book, the Kindle becomesmy capturing method.And in all my books,all my highlights are on a single device. The Kindle.And thatis capturing.The first C of building a second brain.Then number 2.Connect. And connectis perhaps the most important part.In connect, this information starts getting catalogued by you.Information can be in any shape, in any language,captured at any time, can be used at any time.But how do wemerge all of it?Think about it this way.You are reading a book.And you find anamazing quote in it.The quote saysâPro is the amateurwho showed up every day.â By the way,this is from my first book, Do Epic Shit.And you loved this quote.You feel inspired. You basically think, âAbsolutely.If as an amateur,every day,if I show up to work; it could be any work,then slowly and steadily,after correcting my mistakes, learning new things, observing people,I will become a pro one day.â Thatâs inspiring.So, I have to justremind myself. I have to show upevery single day.I have to show upevery single day. Butyou also think thisquote is very good. Like I would love to use this quote whenever I amin a group, in a conversation.If I say this quote like,âI was reading this book.Ankur Warikoo, Do Epic Shit. It had an amazing quote. The pro is the amateurwho showed up every day.âThen people will be like, âWow. Really amazing, Suresh. Really amazing, Ramesh.Since when did you start reading books?!!â So yousuddenly have2 reasonsor 2 purposes for this information. Youwant to use it not just for inspiration.You also want to use it as a quote.So, when you are capturingthis information,whatever your tool is,you will actually also make the connections.And in connections, you will write that,âThis quotecaptured on this tool,it has these 2 uses.Or these 2 tags.Or these 2 nomenclatures.Or these 2 classifications.This is a quoteand for me,a personal inspiration too.âAnd inside the quote, you can say âThis quote is an inspirational quote.â So now what you have done.You have divided this 1 thing in 2 parts.It has 2 independent uses.One, as an inspirational quote. Another,to inspire yourself. And what you do is you build this entire infrastructure.So, you say,âI haveSo, you say,âI have a world of quotes.And that world of quotes will have inspirational quotes, romantic quotes,motivational quotes,quotes of any other kind. And then, there is a different world of my personal inspiration.Then there is a worldof personal finance.There is a world of jokes. There is a world of memes.There is a world of songs.There is a world ofHollywood/Bollywood movies.There is a world of TV shows. Whatever the case may be. You build that out. And you then form those connections. If there is only 1 tool then think of how it will work? You are basicallyconnecting the dotsso that anythingthat at any time was captured by you,you can instantly retrieve itbecause you havethose connections formed.There is a very interesting experiment that is currentlygoing on in WariCrew.Since the last 3 years;and me, since the last 7 years,I have been creatingvideo content.Andthere is a lot ofcontent we have.But we havenâtcategorized it yet.This video, for example,should go in which category?It should be in productivity.Butin the Google drive, it is attached to a day.That on 27 Feb,Ankur Warikoo shot this videowhich will be postedon this date in March.Thatâs it.But if we builda databasewhich saysthat this video is a productivity video.Next video which I will shoot will be a technology video.Next video after that willbe a personal finance video.Then suddenly,we have a categorization. We have a way of connecting. Because tomorrow,if we wantall videos on productivitythen just one clickand everything will appear.All the linksare there in front of us or whatever is the way.So, for me,while reading a book,how do I form connections? Once I finish the book, through Kindle,I can take a PDF ofall the highlights that I have made. And after taking all PDFs,I save them in my Notion document.Every single highlight is then categorized. That this is for inspiration. For philosophy.For content. I make a lot of highlights for content too.âThis will makegood Insta reels.ââYouTube shortson this conceptor this topic willbe really good.âAnd I will categorize that.And suddenly, when I start today,like I have toshoot 7 reels today for the next 2 weeks. I will literally clickon the reels sectionand I will seeeverything appear.All the content.Not just from Kindle.If I read an article.If I postedsomething on Twitter.If I saw an Insta reel. If I saw a YouTube short. And all those things will appear altogetherto form that connection. That is the second Cof building a second brain.And then, finally third.If you completedthe first twothen this becomes the easiest one. If not,this becomes the hardest one. Create. Create is simple, through these connections, make things happen.So, I have read this book. Now that I haveread that book,so I can tell people. I can show off.âI read anotherbook in one week!ââAmazing.âButwhatâs the use of that?Whom am I trying to show? I am lying to myself.If I have not learntanything from that bookand through that, if I canât do anything new then why did I read it? When I die,When I die, I wonâtbe remembered bythe number of booksI read in my life.The things that I learnt from itand how I livedmy life using that,that should make me feel good. So itâs very important that whatever I capturethrough my books, through my articles,through my browsing, through my conversations,I document it and I create from it.So, I use that.All the content that I create is madethrough these connections,through this capturing.I will always have the titles floating.And then, for any title, if I find the content, I capture it.I then connect itIf I read anything new in a book then I capture it.I connect it to something. And you essentially form this connection that allows you to create.Because creation is a dedicateddiscipline.YouIt doesnât happen that The biggest The best creationin this world donât happen incidentally.They happen in adisciplined manner. That a person, dedicatedly,every day, every week, every month, every quarter, ever year,with full enthusiasm,full dedication,tries to create something.And that is howcreation happens.And because in their head,they have formed those connections, they are able to do itfaster.The more thisCapture, Connect, Createmodel is used by you,the more you willfind this second brainmerging withyour original brain.And there will come a time when building a second brainwill no longer be aboutthe second brain.It will be about howyou think in the first place.It would have happened that you meet some people and when they are talking, you feel like that, how did he connect this with that thing?Like how did they even think about this?This is lateral thinking.Thatâs the word we use.They think very laterally.Essentially what they have done isuse this entire connectEssentially what they have done isthrough thecapture, connect, create method, they have createdtheir own infrastructurefrom wherethey consume information,connect itand create using it.And this has become so natural for themthat they can do itin their sleep now.And it doesnât feel like a different activity.If you are in your 20sthen you wonât beable to do it yourself.And this wonât happen naturally. It will take time.But you need to start that time today. And thisis the best model. Tiago Forteâs courseis very expensive and I know a lot of usmay not be able to afford it, particularly when we are so youngand so early in our earning phase.That is why I wanted to summarizehow theâBuilding a Second Brainâcourse works.There are many other nuances.There are many other techniques.I will not be able togo through them and I donât want to as wellbecause that will be unfairon Tiagoâs course.But presenting this model in front of youwas something that I feltwas helpfuland could have been helpfuland I felt was necessary.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo.
