Ok, awesome!So here is what we are going to do Viram.We are going to go through 6 questionsand what I need from you is,and you can take as much time as you want,I will do the edit at my end,so don't worry about whether it's getting long,don't try to fit into a time schedule or something.We will cover number one,the account opening time,and how it's a fairly long-drawn process,and what you have done to circumvent that.We will then talk about the loading charges by itself.So, the charges that the banks chargeplus the exchange rate chargethat we tend to pay and how have you fixed that.Weâll then talk about the fact that there isvery little data and insight intowhat you could be buyingor if you are looking at a certain stockthen trends, analysis, technical detailswhich most investors would care about.Then there is a lot of emphasis on justbuying direct stocks but the biggest opportunityis around buying portfolio,so how do you go about handlingthat through Vest that you have introduced.Then the withdrawal fee which is currentlyat $35 and how youâve gone about fixing that.And then finally, taxation and dividendwithholding or the entire complexityaround just that piece andhow have you gone solving for that.Ok, so these are the 6 piecesand as I said the video will flow in to meintroducing these 6 problems inmy current US investing,then introducing you guys as someonewhoâs fixed it and bringing you inand out of this entire video,to lend in the voice of the expert,who also happens to be thewhoâs fixed this problem.Ok, cool, perfectOk? Cool awesome!Fine, no introduction, I will do allthat in the video, letâs go straightinto the conversations andwe should be able to do that.So Viram, there was one thing thatI noticed when I set up my bank accountfor trading in US Stocks,and you canât do it from your local Indian bank.You have to set up an equivalent in the US.It was a fairly long-drawn processand I wasnât even sure of whetherIâm doing the right way, wrong way,as an Indian national setting upa bank account in the US,seemed intimidating for someone like me,so I can imagine how it would befor someone else.So I would love for you to tell uswhat does it really mean?Why do we have to do it?And is there something that youhave done to make it simpleror at least less intimidating?Yeah, yeah yeah, definitely.So, this has actually been something Ankur,that weâve been working onfor the last almost 8-12 months,where what weâve doneâ¦Ok, before we get to what weâve done,let me describe how it use to work.So, early on what you do is you areopening a US brokerage account, right.So an entity that is registered in the UShas to do your KYC and earlier it used totake about 3-4-5 business days,once you submit your information.So, submitting information is fairly quick,once you submit your information,that entity then has to do KYCwhich would take a lot of time and it wouldsort of mean that customers have to waitfor long periods to just open an account.And now what weâve done in the new process is,so, as a US registered entity,we are registered with the SEC,what we could do is we could bringthe process inhouse, so we coulddevelop our own process which isunique to the Indian investor.So there are certain nuances,for like an Indian investor where,a lot of them have initials in their name,so we had to create a process thatkind of works around it, or names mightnot be standardized between let's saya PAN and an Aadhar,so again we had to figure out a solution.What we've done on the backendis created this kind of home-brewedKYC solution that has allowed Indian investorsto open US accounts now almost real time,so we have an auto channel whereyou can open account. If all yourdocuments are in order,your account gets opened up real time,or else on average now even if it goesinto manual queue, we process themvery quickly and on average we're ableto open an account now in 3 hoursversus earlier it used to take 3 business days.So now if your friend comes in andkind of tells you, 'Hey! I have invested in Apple,you should get started', you can actuallyget started quickly otherwise you'd waitfor days before you could even do it.That's so awesome man!And I remember exactly the US marketis like this hyped-up market,like something big would behappening there, some big launch.I remember the last time I invested,there was this Coinbase IPOand I was really keen to do it,and the next thing I knew is that ittakes 4-5 days for the money to evenreach there, so much money is neededto open an account, it takesso much of time, so on and so forth.So opening it up in real timeor at best 3-4-5 hours is incrediblebecause I have done this processand I know how painful that can be.Thank you for that!Once the account is opened Viram,the big challenge after that whichI personally faced and a lot of myaudiences also faced is, it is veryexpensive to send money out of Indiato the US. I use ICICI and it has astandard charge of â¹1000 plusthe fluctuation of the exchange rate,the spread through which the bank ismaking money, that is there.So I suddenly find that if I want tomake a transfer of â¹1 lakh, then I haveto pay extra â¹4-5-6000 to just makethat happen, and that unfortunatelydestroys the biggest thing that I wouldwant to do, which is set a disciplineto invest in the US market.Like in the Indian market I can do an SIPevery month which comes almost forfree if I am doing a directly witha mutual fund or a Smallcase and so on,if there is an economical way for meto do the same thing for US Stock investing,that is a big problem solved.How have you solved that?Yeah yeah, we struggled very hard tosolve this problem. We knew it from thebeginning that this is the biggest issue, right.If you can't even load money inan easy manner, then even afteropening the account it take anothertwo days to operate it. So here weare very excited. We are launchinga new solution called Vested Direct.We have streamlined the entire process in this.So earlier I think there were three main problems.One was, as you said it was very expensive.Second was, you did not have the visibilitythat once the money is gone,then where is it and when will it reach US,you had no idea.And third was, there were too many steps.You had to add a beneficiary,then you have to transfer on exchange rate.All those things were very complicated,so what we have done now is createdthis solution called Vested Directwhich works within the existingRBI regulations where we opena wallet for you, that wallet is openedonce you have done your KYC,and then you can directly load INR inthat wallet, and then you can put ina request to transfer it inyour US brokerage account.So, this simplifies 2-3 things.One is, for me the cost is simplified a lot.Where it used to take â¹1000-1500 asa fixed rate, plus the FX markup which isabout 2-3%, which people are not evenaware of, so both of those are whatwe made very transparent.One is fixed fees gone.There is no no fixed fee, there is zero fixed fee.The second is, it's a 1.2% markup versusthe 2-3% markup that used to get charged earlier.So it's the industry best if youwant to send money outside.This pretty much is the lowest thata retail individual can get,and so now what it does is two things.One, you can load money at a muchcheaper cost and invest the savings.Second is, now you can do SIP as well.Now you are not charged a fixed feeevery time, because people weren'tdoing it because of that fixed fee,so now is a standardized fee acrossevery transfer, so you can basicallykeep doing it on a monthly basisif you want as well.And the second thing that improves isnow you have complete visibility.You know where your money is deducted,now it is in the US, now it willget credited into the brokerage account,and it gets done at a much faster rateas well, because now we can see themoney travelling throughout the entire process.And then lastly, it's a very seamless online process.You can sit at home, 3 simple clicks,you can load money into yourVested account and get started.So it makes it much easier.So today we are sitting in an age of UPI, right?So, if you still have to wait for 3-4 days,then it just doesn't make sense.So, now account opening 3 hours,come on Vested Direct, the same dayyou should be able to start investingin US Markets, and going forwardwe'll make it much more and more fasterfor our customers so thatthey can get started quickly.Fantastic amazing! That is music to my ears!So you said, first there is no fixed fee charge,there is a standard 1.2% FX chargewhich I would agree is one of the lowest,if not the lowest that I've heardso far for a retail investor.You have direct visibility, so where isthe money and to keep a check onwhether it is misplaced or not,you get all those details.And you are doing it much much much fasterthan usually what it takes.So the FOMO around it, that todaythe market is up, this stock is about to launch,you are actually getting closerto the point where, just the wayI can invest in Indian stock market instantlyif something big has happened,I can do the same thing there as well.Brilliant! Vested Direct!I will take a note of that.I want to then go into the next part.Now I am personally a user of Zerodha,and I think Zerodha is a great productbecause for someone who is starting upor for someone who is a veryseasoned investor, it has all theinformation that one needs beforeinvesting into a stock for a mutual fundor anything like that.And most such options in India forinvesting in the US are not available.I find myself going to a Yahoo Finance,or some business information website,to get details about the movement ofa certain stock, what are its ratios,and so on and so forth.Is that something that you havealso tried to solve for?Yeah yeah very much so!At Vested our motto is kind ofdiversification made easy ordiversify with ease, so every decisionthat we make is about how canwe make our investors' life easy?So in those terms, what we have doneis given them 3-4 kinds of tools thatallow them to make their investmentsin an easier manner.Once the money has reached there,then what?So the first thing...The first thing that we have done is,now when the markets are open,that time you get real time price updates,so for that we have to build ourown infrastructure in the USso that we can give those real time prices.How does it happen in India?You get those prices from the exchange,but in the US there are multiple exchanges,there are multiple entities calledMarket Makers as well, so you haveto get your own data sourceand you have to build that infrastructure.So now you can see your portfolioin real time in India in the evening,how is it fluctuating.You can do your trades easily bywatching those price movements.So this is one.Then second is, if you are afundamental investor, an investorwho does company research,understands the company's business modeland then invests, for that we haveprovided a lot of fundamental datafor each stock, where you get informationabout the balance sheet, the income statement,their ratios, their financial ratios fromwhich you can measure the company's health,so all of those things we give you onthe stock base, so that you can makeyour decisions in a much easier manner.The third thing we have done is, we havelaunched this thing called Vested Trends,where you can basically see where otherIndian investors are investing inthe US market on that platform,and how much cumulatively,like for example, considered Tesla,you can see what percentage ofVested users are holding Tesla.Across time, you can see trends,all the fluctuations, which are thepopular stocks you can see all thaton Vested Trends and it isavailable to everybody.And lastly, if you are an advanced investor,you like charting, you like trading,so you can avail that as well,where you can see all the trading,where you can see all the chartsbasically on the platform,so there you can go to advanced chartingand see each stock's chartand place your trades accordingly.Fantastic man!Very good!Very useful! Definitely very useful!As an investor, I can tell you that.And then Viram, there comes a pointwhere most often than not,especially for early investors,for them to bet on a stock isa big commitment becausethey do not know whether this companywill be successful or not, this industrywill be successful or not, so on and so forth.And that's why a big recommendationis go for a a Portfolio of stocks, a thesisor an idea in which you want to invest,and it could be whether you want tobuy technology stocks, or high growthcompanies' stocks, or a combination thereof,just like our mutual fund ora small case equivalent.There are ETFs in US which are theequivalent around that, but I have heardthat you have made your own equivalentto help Indian investors start investingin the US market.Can you talk about that?Yeah yeah yeah definitely!So we have created this thing calledVest for our portfolio, for our customers.Basically, if you look at a spectrum,then there will be stocks on one sideand ETFs on the other end, where youare either getting exposure of anindividual company or a lot of companies.But there is nothing in the middle,there, if somebody is passionate abouta particular theme or they want tobuy 3-4 ETFs and make a portfolio,then people do not have any ideaabout what to do? And especially inthe US market, there it's very new,people don't know what to start with,if nothing then they buy Apple Google Facebook,but that may not be the right strategyfor your portfolio, for your risk profile,so that's why we made this Vest,where basically in a single click,you can either invest in a theme,for example there is a theme calledsoftware as a service,another called digital cash, all thesecompanies that are working witha digital fintech base, or multi-asset portfolioswhere you can buy multiple assetsin a single click underlying ETFs,so we have created a feature like that where,easily whoever wants advicecan get started creating their portfolioin an easy manner.So, in the previous question,be so how we gave tools to peoplewho want to do their own researchand then invest, and here if someonewants to create a portfolio,but they don't know and don't havethe time to research, then this Vestis best suited for them wherethey can invest easily and takethe benefit of diversification.Awesome! Very cool!Simplifies this a lot!Very nice!And then, we bought the stocks,we made the profit, we sold that,everything is done nicely,now we have to get this money back to Indiafor our own purpose. Currently it'sinsanely expensive to do that. $35 is thestandard fee for you to withdrawanything, which I have heard about,and that is quite limiting.Then what happens is, you have tokeep the money there, wait for a timefor it to invest, so you cannot enjoythe benefit of the Global marketwhere if the US market is not doing wellbut Indian market is doing good,so you can invest in India,or if Indian market is not doing wellbut US is doing great so youcan spend it back, so thatnice happy flow of money is restricted.Is there something that you have doneto fix this entire withdrawal fee problem?Yeah yeah yeah definitely!So, I would say we are in kindof phase 2 of fixing this.Earlier it was $35, which was just broken.Now what we have done isreduced the cost by one-third.We have basically worked outan agreement where we can reducethat cost to a fixed fee of $11.Now there is soon going to bePhase 3 which is much cheaperthan that also.And the customer will get thesame kind of visibility like Vested Direct,so that's again something thatwe are working on.But in the meantime, we havereduced the cost to one-third.Very cool!So you are trying to replicate thewhole loading mechanism of Vested Directfor withdrawal as well, but as of nowfor a start you have reduced $35 to $11which is frankly a great saving by itself.And then hopefully over time, this $11will also come back, and there will bean absolute visibility about where is the money,and when will it come back,which makes a lot of sense.Finally, and this is a very commonlyasked question, not just for USbut in India in general, about taxationon capital gains, whatever profitsyou have made, long-term, short-term,it is a different long-term short-termdefinition in the US than it is in India.Then the dividend tax is also differentin India and in the US. The dividend taxis withheld in US, then you can claimit through a tax treaty in your income tax,so it's very complicated and franklylittle intimidating as well.What has been done to simplify that?Yeah yeah, I'll tell you one more complication.Another complication is that thefiscal year is different.Jan-December versus March-March,so when the US broker will give youthe document at some time andyou will file it at some other time,then what do you do?So basically what we have createdis a solution for the Indian investors,where at the end of March,you can see your reports.One, in local currency,and second, as per local regulations.So basically we will differentiateand show you your capital gains,short-term versus long-term,and convert both of them in rupees,and give you a simple reportas per the income tax laws,where you can see how muchlong-term gain you made in rupees,and you have to pay the tax,which is standard rate,and how much is the short-termon which you have to pay the taxaccording to your Income Tax slab.So this is a very simple report whichwe give to our customersat the end of March.And the second thing is,when we talk about dividends,then a certain withholding happensin the US and you can take the creditof that's withholding in India.So for that, it's either two things.One is, if your withholding is not significant,you can skip that entire process that,'I don't want to go through the hassle'.The second is your withholding issignificant and you want to takecredit for it, we give you all theinformation you need.Basically you need to file a form 67,so will give exactly that to you,you can copy paste it on online form,online platform, you caneither give it to your CA.You can just copy pasteall of that information.Again we give it to you in Rupees.This is the dividend income youearned in the last year and this is thecredit that you can take, this iswhat you have to fill in each of thedifferent schedules of the Income tax filingthat you have to do.So, at first it would be a learning curve,but once you do it, after that it becomesvery streamlined becauseyou know exactly what to fill where.Very nice man! Very nice!So as I said in the video, there arespecifically 6 problems in US investingfor an Indian investor and it seems thatyou have started to tackle all those6 problems at different varying levels.You have managed to solve a lot,and that's why I have personallymoved to Vested for my US investingand I am more than happy to vouchfor the fact that it has beenan incredible journey.Thank you so much for joining man!It was great!I love the product focus!I love the approach!I love the objective of helpingdiversification become easy for everyone.Congratulations! All the best!And thank you so much Viram!Thank you Ankur, it was a pleasure!And thanks for having me!Thank you!
