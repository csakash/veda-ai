You must have heard of inflation,but how fast it eats up our money,you may not have heard of it.There is a rule of 70, a very interesting rule.If you divide the inflation rate by 70,it will tell you in how many yearsyour money will be halved in value.Say, if the inflation is 7%,it means within 10 yearsthe value of your money will be halved.So what you can buy today for â¹1,00,000,within 10 years,you will left with only â¹50,000,and after 10 years, only â¹25,000.That's why it is said that inflationis not going anywhere.To save your money, you need to invest.
