we'll go straight into this tooand will get started.No intro anywhere.Four things will be covered in this video.Number 1: Quick summaryof what are index mutual funds.Number 2:What is tracking error and trackingdifference in index mutual funds?Number 3:Why does this tracking error appear?Number 4:How can you select your mutual fundsdue to this tracking error?Number 1:What are Index Mutual Funds?Index mutual funds are those mutual funds,which maps a particular indexand invest in it.For example,the well-known index in Indiais the NIFTI 50 Index.Which tracks India's top 50 stockslisted on the National Stock Exchange.So as the composition of those 50 changes,meaning, it is not necessary thatthose 50 stocks stay where they are.Some of them move out.Some new ones get addedand their weightage,that is, how much importanceevery stock should get,basis something calledthe market capitalization,which is the value of that company,so, these 50 stocks keep movingand if any index tracks it,that is called the NIFTY 50 Index.Now, a mutual fund can say,these are the top 50 companies of Indiaand if we invest in them,then we will somewhat representhow will these top 50 companies combineto give a good return.So, they will create a mutual fundcalled a NIFTY 50 Index Mutual Fundwhose function will be that,as this actual NIFTY 50 Index moves,accordingly, that mutual fundwill buy or sell those stocks,which comprises these top 50 stocks.Similarly, you can havea Mid Cap Index Mutual Fund.Similarly, you can havea Small Cap Index Mutual Fund.Which again are tracking indexeswhich is given to you by the stock marketsby very fundamentally establishing it.But tracking all of this is not easybecause these stocksare changing every day.Changing every second.So, to make sure that your mutual fundis tracking exactly the same thing,becomes a challengebecause of which two things happen.Tracking difference and tracking error.This is the second part of the video.So, assume,you have invested in an index mutual fund,which tracks the NIFTY 50and every year, for the last five yearsyou have received these returnsso 10%, 11%, 12.4%, 13.1%, 11%.In exactly these many years,the NIFTY 50 has generated these returns,11%, 10.5, 13.9, 12.9, 11.2.Now this is possible.It is not necessarythat the Index Mutual Fundthat you have invested in, will alwaysgive lesser returns than NIFTY 50or whatever index it is tracking.It can sometimes give even moreand that is also visible,for example, here.so tracking differenceis simply the annualized returnof the index minus the actual indexthat it is tracking.And this is then the number.So, you gave 1% less return for a year,gave 0.5% more in the second year,then gave 1.5% less, then gave 0.2% more,then gave 0.2% less.And this is calledthe tracking difference.Tracking error,which a more important metric,that is the standard deviationof these annualized returnswhich is 0.8%.Standard deviation is a bit technical,so will not go into it.Just remember that tracking erroris the annualized standard deviationof the tracking difference.Means the differencebetween your index mutual fundand the actual index being trackedand its annualized standard deviation.It is another way of saying,how well this index mutual fundhas tracked the actual index.That is why,it is such an important metric.Because if this number is very large,suppose it is 10%,this means that the indexis going in some other directionand the mutual fundthat you have invested in,which is tracking the same indexis always deviating 10% from it.So, over a period of timethat difference becomes really bigso by definition, this tracking errorshould be very, very small.Now, number 3:Why does this tracking error come at all?because if you are following an indexthen just follow it with utmost diligence.Technology has advanced so much,why would you not beexactly tracking the same thing.There are three big reasons,due to which mutual funds,which are index mutual funds,fail to track the actual index.Number 1: Expense ratio.Whenever you invest in any mutual fund,whether you did it directlyor you invest in regular mutual funds,you give an expense ratioto that mutual fund.So, your â¹100 which is invested,not 100 out of them,99 point something, somethinggets actually investedand rest of the expenses,is used by the mutual fundto run its own business,your buying and selling chargesof the mutual funds, blah, blah, blah.This small difference,adds to the tracking error,because admittedly,the entire â¹100 that you had generated,have not invested that,have invested a smaller amount than that.So admittedly, you haven't replicatedexactly the same portfoliowhich the index is doing.And this is number one,why the tracking error creeps in.Number 2:Deployment of funds or cash reserves.In any mutual fund, at any point,at least 2-5% of the cash remains idle.In the sensethat it is not invested in the market.Why? Because if you wantto sell your mutual funds,they will not bring that moneyby selling those stocks.They will give you out of the cash reserveand they will ensure the cycle continues.Which means the 2-5% that remainseven that like the expense ratiois not investedand that will lead to an error.Second, if ever, imagine,the financial year is coming to an endand people have invested a bit moreor year end is about to end,people got a lot of bonusesso that got invested,or dividends have been released,companies have announced,so all that moneyhas come into mutual fund,suddenly the cash surplus increasesand it gradually gets invested again.In other words,your entire investment potentialnever gets completely invested.There is a very small amountthat is still reservedand that's why because of that,a tracking error can creep in.Number 3, which happens very rarelybut does happen sometimes,when you are trying to buy or sell stocksyou are unable to do so.because it can be liquidityor some market conditionhas changed overnight.For example,when COVID struckin March 2020 or April 2020,overnight the markets fell almost 40%so, you can imaginethat if anyone was tryingto buy or sell at that point,then even for a very small durationits price must be moving very fast.and that may bring in a tracking error,because the entire marketis being shifted very big in a big swingand that is the third reasonbecause of whichtracking error can creep in.Now, I have explainedwhat is tracking errorand how does it come in.Now because of this,what will you do about it as an investor?And that is section four of the video.So, number 1:whenever you're buyingany index mutual fund,be it NIFTY 50,Mid Cap, Small Cap, or any other index,definitely look for the tracking error.Don't be happy just seeing the returns,as the tracking errorwill be a very strong determinant,that whether it is actually ableto map the index or not.For example, on the screen you can see,this is by a site called Cafemutual,this please, is not endorsed.I just googled, finding what is it.This is from August 30th,so the data is a bit dated.And according to them, top 3 of 34,the Large Cap, Index Mutual Funds,or NIFTY 50 Mutual Funds that are there,their lowest tracking errorones are these.So SBI, NIFTY Index Mutual Fund,or UTI NIFTY 50,they have a tracking error of 0.03%.Which means it is really closeto the actual index.Almost, the same thing is happening.So, as the index performs,you can be almost guaranteed,to the point of 0.03%,that your mutual fund returnswill also be similar to that.HDFC Index S and P, which is 0.04%and HDFC Index Fundwhich is a NIFTY 50 Plan is 0.05If you come into Mid Cap,then top three of all,Aditya Birla Sun Life NIFTY Mid Cap,this Mid Cap 150 is an index,of course, which is definedby the National Stock Exchange,that is 0.14%.Motilal Oswal is 0.16.Nippon India is 0.17.These again, please, are not endorsements.Donât buy this mutual fund because of it.I am just showing youwhat is the actual dataas reported by the site called, Cafemutualabout which I didn't know until today.Small Cap, Aditya Birla, Motilal,again 0.148, 0.14%, 0.18%, 0.24%.So, you will seethat the tracking error which is thereis usually very less.Ideally, it should not bemore than 2 or 3% or so.And most of them are--The best ones are less than 1%.So, due to this, what you want to dois lowest tracking errorand highest return combinationshould be your mutual fund choice.So, whenever you are buyingany Index Mutual Fund,lowest tracking errorand highest possible return,given that only lowest tracking errorshould be chosen.Which will be the right wayfor you to go about selectingan index mutual fund.If you are not buyingan index mutual fund,then tracking error becomes irrelevant.So, if you are buyingany sector mutual fund,for example, be it any technologyor any FMCG-based mutual fund,or you are buyingany country-specific mutual fund,for example,it could be a US-centered mutual fund,or if you are buyingany growth mutual fund,in which there are many companies,selected on the basis of their growth,or if you are buying any opportunityor dividend mutual fund,then that could also be different.So, they do not track any index.This is an active manager sittingand deciding whether to buy this stockor invest in this countryor invest in this combination.There you don't have to track anythingcalled the tracking error.But if you are doing in index mutual fund,then a tracking error becomesa very, very important determinantof the successes of the mutual fund.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
