How can you reach aportfolio of â¹1 crore while takingthe least risk?We'll know in this videothrough an Excel sheet.In this Excel sheet,I have identified 10 asset classes, i.e. options for investments.So, FD is done,you can invest in real estate, not by buying land but let's say REITs,corporate bonds,EPF, Employee Provident Fundor Public Provident Fund.S&P 500,which means investing intop 50 companies of the U.S.Nifty 50,India's top 50 companies,you can invest in themlike a mutual fund,You can buy goldIndia's top 100mid-sized companies,you can invest in MidCap 100 index.Again, a mutual fund.Small Cap 250,India's top 250 small-sized companies,you can invest in its index,and then you caninvest in Bitcoin.And what I did was,how much was their on an averagereturn in the last 5 years.So, FD has 6%,Real Estate - 7%,Corporate Bond - 7.5%,EPF - 8.4%,S&P - 8.7%,Nifty 50 - 10.6%,Gold - 10.4%,MidCap - 14.24%,SmallCap 250,and Bitcoin has 36.91%.If you look at this,you'll say,"What's the load?Invest all your money in Bitcoin.It's the best growth.It's doubling every 2 years.Best investing option."Of course, what it doesn'ttake into account isrisk.How much risk will youtake for doing this,and should you takethat risk or not?So, we will put an importantconsideration of safety.In finance terms,this is what's calledalpha and beta.Alpha is absolute growthand beta is how much risk you haveto bear to achieve that growth.Now, the principle of life iswhether it's investing or it's anyimportant decision in lifethat you have tomaximize your alpha,you have to maximize your growth,while keeping your beta the lowest.Keeping the risk at the lowestand the best growth you can hit.Often people make two mistakes.Number 1: They optimize growthbut ignore beta.So, they say, "Put all the money in Bitcoin."And what will happen with that?There is high alpha, but there is also high beta,and that createsinvestment where you seethe screen every day,see the graph,look at the ups and downs,it is just not viable.The second mistake,exactly the opposite,"To hell with all this,I love my peace and quiet more,I will put all my money in FD."So, low alpha because low beta.Both of these are notthe right approaches.In this video, we will tryto understand an approach in whichyou can maximize your returnwhile managing your risk or safety.So, I will try and classifythat these 10 asset classes,how safe are they?We will give the safestnumber 10 position.We will give the lowestnumber 1 position.Let's start.FD, everyone agrees,is the number 10 itembecause it is the safest.What will happen after FD?I will say EPF.We will give it a number 9.Then, gold - number 8.Then, real estate - number 7.Then, let's say corporate bond,which would be 6.Then, S&P 500, becauseit's a bit unknown, which is why 5.Then, Nifty 50,actually we shouldgive 5 to Nifty 50.And we will give S&P as 4.Then, Mid Cap 100,because they are mid-sized companies,don't know how they will do,3.Small cap companies are very small,don't know what might happen, so, 2.Bitcoin is the most risky,so we will give it a number 1.And because of this, we havegiven a safety numberto each asset class.Through this, we will find out whatI call the return safety metric.This is a metric that youwill not find in any book.It has no foundation.It's introduced by Ankur Warikoofor the first time in this video,and after today's video, it will be suppressed,but it is necessary for this video.It is simple that we willmultiply the returnover the last 5 years and safety metricto give us a number.That's it.That is it.There is no rocket science logic.What we are doing is calculatingand multiplying these twoto get an average.So our average is 52%, means 0.52,which tells me that ifwe look at the risk andreturn of all these assetclasses in a balanced way,then a vague metriccomes to around 52%.If it is more than 52%,then it is risky.If it is more than 52%,it is safer or low risk.If it is less than 52%, then it is risky.And our goal will behow to maximize our returnby staying around 52%.Let's look at 5 approachesthat I could think of.Number 1:We will put much thought into it.We will distribute 10%in these 10 classes.So suppose you startan SIP of â¹10,000,and you say,"â¹1,000 in FD,â¹1,000 in real estate."What can you buy for â¹1,000?But we will take REITs.We bought corporate bonds of â¹1,000.We did an EPF of â¹1,000.We invested â¹1000 in S&P 500.Nifty 50, Gold, MidCap,SmallCap, Bitcoin.Covered everything.Its average is 12.8%,meaning on an average, youwill earn 12.8% every year,and its averagesafety metric is 52%,which is the same averagebecause we have done 10% each.Let's see how this 12.8% performs.So if you do this SIP of â¹10,000 for 10 years,then you money will growand become â¹24 lakhs.After 15 years, â¹53 lakhs.After 20 years, â¹1.10 crore.After 25 years, â¹2.16 crore.After 30 years, â¹4.16 crore.Very good.With just a SIP of â¹10,000,you became a millionairewithin 20 years.Brilliant.And how much risk did you take?To the extent of 52%.Now, a person comes.He says, "Ankur Warikootells us to invest in stocksbecause it is a good choice.Why to play with thesesmall safe things like FDs?To hit boundarieson the first ball."Okay.So let's see another allotment.In this allotment, you willonly invest in the stock market.You won't put muchthought in that either.You put 33% in Nifty 50.33% in Mid Cap.33% in Small Cap.Your return wentfrom 12.8% to 14.2%.Wow!But your safety went down from 52% to 43%,meaning you increased the returnbut it became more risky.You reduced its safety.This is not something thatI would necessarily suggestbut let's see how this pans out.You won't see muchdifference in 10 years.The â¹24 lakhs havenow become â¹26 lakhs,but the difference willbe visible after 20 years.The â¹1.10 crore that could have been,that is now â¹1.33 crore.After 30 years,the difference is terrific.The â¹4.16 crorewould now be â¹5.70 crore.This is the differencebetween just 12.8 and 14.2%.Very good.But for this,you will have to take a risk.Safety will be less.So, another gentleman comes and says,"I used to say,listen to your parents.They are not stupid when they saythat all the moneyshould be invested in FD."Okay. Let's see.So you have invested allthe money in allotment 3in FD.So, you get â¹10,000and you put it in FD,and this is what happens.You will get a return of 6.1%,but your safety has increasedfrom 52% to 61%.Wow!And you are like, "Very good.This is what I wanted in life."Now let's see what happens.After 10 years,the â¹24 lakhs that could have been,that is now â¹16 lakhs.After 30 years,what could have been â¹1 croreis still â¹46 lakhs.After 30 years,it could have been â¹4.1 crorebut in FD,now after 30 years,you have reached thelevel of â¹1 crore.There is no sensibility anywhere,but some people think like this.Some are a little smarter.They say, "Look,I believe money is burnt in FDbut safety is also important."Absolutely important.I agree.So, why don't we investin the safest assets?So, what were the safest assets?Numbers 10, 9 and 8.So, FD, EPF and Gold.It is quite safe.Let's invest money in them.So,33% each inFD, EPF, or PF in general,and Gold.Now, let's see what happens.Very interesting.Your return increasedfrom 6.1% to 8.2%.So, it increasedbut surprisingly,your safety alsoincreased from 61% to 72%.Do you see what just happened?You increased your safetyand increased your returns.This is the best place to be.So, if you really want to play safe,then this portfolio or allotmentmakes far better sensethan investing all the money in FDbecause it increases your returnsand also increases your safety.Let's see how the numbers look.After 10 years,â¹24 lakhs are now â¹18.5 lakhs.Okay.After 20 years, it was â¹1 crore.Now, it is â¹60 lakhs.After 30 years,it could have been â¹4.16 crores.Now, it is only â¹1.5 crores.So, it is hit.Why?Because your return was 12.8%and now it is only 8.2%,but along with safety,you have hit a jackpot.Jackpot?You have hit the jackpot.You have increasedfrom 52% to 72% safe,which is awesome.What should be theideal allotment?Now, when I say ideal,I don't mean that it's for everyonebut if you do mathand play only on numbers,keep emotions asidebecause they will come ultimately,then this would make sense.I have made it greenbecause you can playas much as you wantwith these numbersin this sheet.Download this sheetand then you canplay around with it.Let's see how this works.5% we say should be in FD.It is FD, it is secure.Not a little, it is very secure.It keeps the mental balance.You feel a little safety.Please do that.20% we will put in PF.So, the deduction fromyour salary is thereand we'll put moreover and above that.It is lock-in, it doesn't matter.It is 15 years, it doesn't matter.The money is getting invested, so it is good.10% we will put in S&P 500.Why? Because it is the U.S.,the largest company in the world.So, that company will alwaysdo something somewhere.So, it is like a mitigationagainst India, if God forbid,India's market evergoes through anything.25% we will put in Nifty 50.So, this is likewe are taking a betin India's top 50 companies.Let's just see how that goes.15% we will put in gold.So, gold will also be good.10% in mid-cap, 10% in small-cap,and 5% in Bitcoin,only if you understand it.It is not necessary at all,but because its return can be good,that's why we will put itbut we also knowthat 5% can be zerobecause it is high risk.So, if in future Bitcoin orthe concept gets erased,who knows?We will still take that riskbecause we are ready to take it.You can easily make this zero.It doesn't matter.It is your wish.Let's see what this does.Do remember what was our averagereturn if we put 10% in all classes?12.8%If we put it in stocks only,14.2%If we use this mix, it is 12.1%,and look at howinteresting this becomes.Safety was52% at average level.We have increased that safety.We have made it 57%,which is we made it more safe.Yes, because of this,our return has taken a small hit but not that much.So, 12.8% has become 12.1%which seems it isalmost in that range.If we play the game only in stocks,then the return is very good,14.2% butrisk is a lotbecause it is 43% safewhich is lower than the52% which should be.Let's look at 12.1%and 57% safety,what can we do?We see that the differenceis not much in 10 years.â¹24 lakhs is now â¹23.18 lakhs.So, it seems good.10 years later,it could have been â¹1.10 crore,that has become â¹1 crore,meaning within 20 years,you have hit thecrorepati statuswith both these approaches,which is awesome.30 years later,it could have been â¹4.16 crore,that is â¹3.60 crore.So, not too far away,and this is what I mean bybalancing risk and return.What did you do?You smartly allocated your moneyin such a way thatyour return will also be good.12.1% is not a bad return,and your safetyis also not compromised.In fact, it has increasedfrom the average.Of course, it is notbetter thaninvesting in FD only orinvesting in safe assets onlybut in this compromise,we have been able toearn a very good returnand we would getthese numbers delivered.This is the wayI would want you to think about riskand return.In life, you should notrun after alpha onlyand not be afraid of beta only.Combination is important.Whatever it is,whether it is investing money,career decision,college decision, partner decision,decision to change the country,decision to change the city,decision to leave the house,decision to buy a house,whatever the decision, whether it is big or small,always look forhow can I getmaximum Alpha atlowest possible beta.How can I get maximum returnin lowest possible risk?And when you find that answer,you would have madea smart choice.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off.
