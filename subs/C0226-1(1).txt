Check 1 2 check alrightThrough this video, I will share with you5 steps that I used in my childhoodto become a master at speaking English,the language.Friends this video is not aboutthe English language so I don't wantthis to come across as,'Britishers have gone, but left English here!',and any of that.This is not glorifying English as a language.This is about if you want to achieve masteryin any language not in terms of knowingthe language but speaking the language,how to speak it,that requires a very different methodologyand a very different process.I studied in an English Medium School,like those Convent schools withEnglish and all that...I don't know what was thisBut Christian Convent School,so it was almost expected thatwhoever studies in English mediumthey definitely know Englishbut that's not true!It's actually not true and you would knowthat from your own experiences,whether you yourself studied there,or your friends studied from English medium,and it's not necessary that whoever wentto an English medium would knowgood English, or good language inwhichever medium they studied.Why? Because learning the basics of a language,like what is a noun, what is a pronoun,what is ABCD, is very different,and learning how to speak andeffectively communicate is very different.So since I had always dreamt of going to the US,study in the university there,do my Ph.D. and become a scientist,I had decided that learning Englishfrom a communication perspectivewas very important for me, and that's whyI took these 5 steps really early in my lifewhich helped me immensely.One of these steps is not of my choice,it was just a stroke of luck from destiny,but I am so glad that now there isa way to change this destiny intoa part of your concrete life which I amreally excited to share aboutbecause I had also thought of sucha product in 2014, and I will actuallywalk you through that journey thathow has that product now translatedand exists in this world, to help peoplebecome masters of a certain language.The first step, this is very important forlaying the foundation for youto speak any new language.ReadingReading in that languageWhen you read English or for that matter,any other language, so I used toread English books. Not those English bookswhich were written in India in Englishby Indian authors, well I shouldn't sayIndian authors because it would seemthat they do not know English,I was referring to Chacha Chaudhary, Pinky, Billu,if you read these in English,that doesn't make you into agood communicator.I meant books written in English,now it could be by an Indian authoror an international author.Now, why is that important?It is important because wheneveryou read the language in EnglishLanguage in English! What am I saying?!Whenever you read in the English languageor for that matter any language,you get to understand how the sentencesare formed and that is the important basisfor you to be able to speak ultimately.You should know sentence formation.Everybody knows noun pronoun verb,but how do they come together toform a sentence and how can youcommunicate effectively, that is important.So how do you do?What is your name?All this is very fundamental, everybody knows,but how do you actually ask someone somethingpolitely that you are scared to ask,and using something like, 'I was wondering ifyou are up for doing something like this.''I was curious if this is something that interestsyou'. Now, how will you learn all these things?When you read it in a book.When these sentences will be formedin an actual fiction or nonfiction book,that is when you will be able to understandhow to form the basis of your sentence formationand thus build the foundation for your speaking.Besides this, there are books to learn Englishand to become effective communicators.Two books..sorryTwo books which I remember I particularlyread in childhood, number one isWord Power Made Easy, I think Norman Lewisis the author, he wrote it and it was really nicebecause it could tell the meaning of the words,and that is so important.We wouldn't know what is thedifference between sweet andWell you would know thedifference between sweet and sourWhat is the difference between desire and urge?What is the difference between mission and vision?What is the difference between Input and habit?There are very minute differencesbut if you use a book to form the foundation,it helps a lot.The second one that I remember wasQuick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking,something like that. It is a book by Dale Carnegie.Please pick this book if you want tobecome an effective speaker.It is a great book!I remember, it tries to teach and showeverything in a very simplified manner,how can you take control over your Englishand become an effective speaker.So, the first thing that I did was,became a fan of reading English books,irrespective of the author and their nationality,but good quality English booksso that I could learn sentence formation.Now based on this, the second thingthat I did was I started writing.Unfortunately, writing has reducedin today's world, and even more sobecause what you write on the mobile phonethat is not English language and hence you arespeaking abilities do not develop.If you write something as smthgor never mind as nm,then that is not really helping,sorry I am not mocking you,but you get the drift, right?If you disturb the foundation ofa language then you will never beable to communicate effectively.Please do one thing for my sake if you wantto become an effective public speaker.One, start writing using a pen and paper.It is very important!How much ever you may want to write,it is not necessary that you have to fill up pages,even one page is good enough if you can writeevery day and write it in proper English.Now that will only happen if you havethe habit of reading, because as I saidreading will form the foundationand because of that you will be ableto write, whatever it is that comes to mind.So a good, nice, happy,and simple way of doing this is,pick any word,apple, pen, paper, watch, anything,and just start writing.Write anything!You don't have to make sense out of it.You don't have to win a Nobel prize.You don't have to win any literary award.Just have to write so that you becomebetter and better and better at formingthe same sentences whichyou have actually read.I remember when I was a kid,I used to write a lot for the school magazine,I used to write poems, short stories,essays, I used to love any excuse for me to write.And that world was also very differentbecause there was no access to a computerso all you had was a pen and paper,so I used to write as much as possible,but I know for a fact that It helped me a lot.The third, and it was not my choicebut I am so glad this happened for me.I grew up in the Lajpat Nagar area of Delhi,and this is a slightly personal storybut I love this because this wasso meaningful in my life.So, we lived on the first floor,we have always lived in a rented house,and there was a Christian familyon the ground floor in our house.And in this Christian family, there weretwo daughters and one brother...Two daughters and one brother?!Two sisters and one brother,these 3 people live there.The sisters were elder to meand the brother was younger to methey only used to speak in English at home,as we may speak in Hindi or our mother tongue,or whatever is a mother tongue.But for them, it was Konkani,which was their mother tongue,but mostly English which wasmost comfortable to them.And I was best friends with them,I am not going to name them forprivacy purposes, but if you are watchingthis video, I don't think I have everthanked you for helping me build myEnglish in such a way that I cannever repay you back.You know who you are,and since I spoke with them in English,I used to play with them every day,so I used to get the opportunityto almost practice speaking English every day.And you would agree with methat there is no better way for youto master the art of speaking any languagethan to actually speak that languagewith someone who speaks the languagevery well because then you learn.I remember this one incident,it's engraved in my mind,we always say 'today morning', we say,'Oh, I woke up today morningand had a really nice breakfast and...SorryElectricity is out Shivam so I amwaiting for that, Aditya can seebut you cannot, you can only hear me,so I am giving you that feedback.Let's sing a song till thenIt's backOk I am starting againI remember this one incident,it's engraved in my mind,we always say 'today morning', we say,'I woke up today morning',so one fine day I was just talkingto those guys and I was just rememberingsomething that I did that morning and I said,'Oh, today morning I got up and I had my breakfast',and then one of the sisters,she corrected me by saying,it's not today morning, it is 'this morning'.So whenever you say today morning,you mention the morning today,it is this morning.You say, 'I woke up this morning',not, 'I woke up today morning'.And it just got engraved in my mind,I mean it just laid a foundationthat cannot be shaken up.That is the power of speakingwith people who you genuinelyknow the language.So I remember, I always rememberthat how much it helped me inspeaking English just becauseI was neighbors with someonewho were comfortable with speaking English,and for them English speaking wasa normal way of living life, for me itwas something that I was learningand just because I spent time with them,my English improved a lot in a year.I think I spent about 4-5 years inthat house, so you can imaginein 4-5 years, starting from5th standard till 8th or 9th standardI was there, there was a drastic changein my speaking English.So in 2014, I was working as theSo in 2014, I was working with Groupon,I used to take care of the businessof Groupon India and Groupon APAC,so I met my counterpart, who usedto handle the other countriesfrom Groupon APAC, I met him onceand he is from Malaysiaand he is immensely inspiring.We were just catching up aboutall the ideas possible,and I distinctly remember,because this journey helped me so much,I proposed an idea with,I proposed an idea just to see howhe reacted to it that we can createan application where if I want tolearn any language, it would be Englishor German or French or Bengali or Marathi,I will select that language,and then I will randomly get allocatedto someone who speaks that languagethrough an app.So, imagine if you want to learn Bengali,then you will click on Bengali,and automatically instantly you will beconnected to a native Bengali speaker,and now because you understand,there is a foundation, you knowa little bit of Bengali, you can understand it,when you start speaking withthat individual, it helps to improveand that was what I did, and I actually wantedto show you proof that thishappened and I am notmaking this thing up.Ok, at this point of time you willgo to to the zoom recordingthat I am going to record.So you can see on the screenthat this email is on October 20th 2014,I wrote it at 10:15 a.m.I wrote to someone named Masmood,it is not important and it was about this,and this was a documentary.It was called Project Chatso I named the application Chat,this is what it is.It seamlessly connects anyonewho wants to learn a new languagewith a trusted peer to practiceon the go.It is the easiest, fastest, safest,and the most affordable way to learna new language connected world.And there was all this about,how it works? How will it be done?What is a product definition?So I was basically thinking of howone can create this product,and during the research of this video,guess what? I came across this product.So I was simply searching on YouTubeabout the products which do thatand there are lots of NGOs who do it,and a lot of volunteering workhappens around this, but there isactually a business which I did not know ofthat does this, and it's called Cambly.So Cambly is a product where,it is only for English language,where if you want to practice speaking English,you sign up on it,you buy minutes,because you have to buy minutes,exactly how I had imaginedfor my product as well.And then you get assigned to anative English speaker anywhere in the world.And to test it, I actually made tworandom calls I spoke to Tonywho is based out of California,it was her second day on Cambly.She was very excited,clearly a little nervous.And Harry, who is from England,if I remember right, he is a tutoron Cambly from 2019, and it is amazingthat this product is actually live.So I got in touch with the Cambly team,I was like, 'Wow! Ok do you havean India presence?'I got in touch with their India unit,I asked them what are their pricing,if I can speak about this,if they would benefit from it,and they were very generous.They have shared with me a codethat you can use to get 30% offon the 3-month plan.Code is in the description below.If you use this link and you use this code,you will get a 30% off on the 3-month plan.But this, my friend, is the best wayto learn how to speak Englishor for that matter any language.If you can speak with a native language speakerin a consistent disciplined manner,like I used to talk to my neighboursevery evening, you will find yourselfchanged in less then 3-6 months.It is that powerful!Because it is all about practice.This is something which is obviousbut it is so true.Ok let me just stop thisOk now going backThe fourth thing that I did afterreading, writing, and since because of luckI could speak to my neighbours every dayand hence practiced my English speaking,now I wanted to actually goand make myself formal.So I started participating in everycompetition that came my way.This was around when I wasin 8th or 9th standard.I was in 7th class when I steppedon the stage for the first time in my life,and I was scared,my hands were trembling,my heart was pounding, I was sweating.I went up on the stage,had to recite a poem,I just puked out that poem,came back, there was no one,no hooting, no reaction, but I didn't carebecause thank God,it was all done with, I was rid of it.I sat down with my friendand he asked me, 'Bro, what was this?'And I said, 'What was what?'He said, 'You went on the stage,you started blabbering, you werespeaking but there was no sound',so it was almost like,like this. I was speaking, maybe I wasexpressing as well but there was no sound.This is who I was when I wasin the 7th standard.And then when I slowly startedbecoming more confident, then I was like,'Now I am going to kill it!'Every competition, school recitals,poem recitals, debates, anything,I participated in everything.It was not to win, but it was tostand in front of the crowd,make myself feel scared, challenged,and because of that prepareand prepare hard.And this is important.If you have already passed out fromschool or college and now you are ina working environment, then everysmallest excuse to go about addressinga crowd, and crowd doesn't need tobe hundreds or thousands of people,it could be anything which is morethan two people, that is a crowd.If you are on a zoom call, then volunteerto introduce everyone to everyone,or volunteer to announce what is theagenda of the meeting, anything, anything small,but it helps so much because it continuouslykeeps building your confidence.And the fifth and the last thing is,I saw a lot of videos that I could of peoplewho I admired, people who weregreat public speakers.When you see other people,then you'll learn from their body language,not just the delivery of the language,but their body language as well,their emotions, their facial features,their hand movements, their body postureif you can see their full body,all of these add to yourrepository of knowledge.So watch as much as you can.In today's world there is no excuse anymore.I am coming from a world whereI had to watch videos through a dial upwhich worked really slowly,I had to buy video CDs,and all of that is now available to youon your smartphone for dirt cheap pricingwhenever you want.So there is no reason for you not to do it.So these five ways, simple, nothing rock solid,nothing out of the ordinary rocket science,but invaluable, if you have to startconquering or mastering the art ofspeaking the English language.Reading so that you can form your sentences.The second, writing so that you canpractice forming the sentences.The third, speaking and speakingas much as you can. If you do not havethe neighbour that I had then you shoulduse something like a Cambly because it givesyou access to native English speakersacross the world.Fourth, participate in any occasionwhich test your English speaking.Then fifth and the last one,learn from others who are really really good.Their body language, their composition,their delivery, because that will impactand influence you in meaningful ways.I hope this was useful.Again, this video is not about glorifyingthe English language, but it isabout any language and therespect towards that language.English is undoubtedly the biggestbusiness language of the world,and if you know English, it makes iteasier for you to conduct businessanywhere in the world, not just in India,but irrespective,if you want to learn any language,whether it's an international languageor your own local and mother tongue,then these will be the five waysyou will have to start with to conquerand become an effective public speaker.I hope this was useful. All the best!Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
