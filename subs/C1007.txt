Check 1 2 okAditya, this will beyour cool video of the week,so make it jazz,don't speed it upbecause time and again,we have got a feedback that I am slow,and people like it that way,they can watch it at 1.5x,don't give beats music,keep it instrumental,if at all then very slow.Add a lot of supers, B-rolls,animation, that makes it richer, ok,just play with that thing, ok.It's ok if you are not ableto go to the top college,this video is here.Friends, I have a favoriteinterview question,Which one would you pick,a good course or a good college?And a lot of people select course.But if you ask me, my answerwould be college.Why college?Because if you go to a good collegewhich is difficult to get in,where the student crowd around youis smarter than you,then you learn a lot in that journey.You are surrounded by smart people,you are taught by the best professors,and you get a lot of opportunities,and that is what definesthe true experience of college.But another reality is thatit has become really really difficultto get into all the good colleges.If you consider the top collegesof Delhi University itself,you need 99.9% to get in.Who are these people?Where did they lose one mark?Won't this spend their whole lifelooking for that one mark,that I wish I had giventhe right answer to thatone question, and I would havegot 100%?Nevermind.I scored 83%.This was in 1998,a lot of you were probablynot even born at that time.In 1998, I scored 83% inthe 12th standard,and because of that I,Thank God!got admission toHindu College North Campus,Delhi University,in its physics course,and I am genuinely so thankfulbecause that experience ofNorth Campus, meeting people,I met my wife there,so it changed my life.But if you are not able toget through a good college,that doesn't mean life is over,because I know of many successfulexamples where even after notgoing to top colleges,they ruled their lifeand shaped it up in the waythey wanted.In this video, I will shareall those ways with you whichapply to today's time for you,if you don't think you arein a top college,and yet you want to make it in life.Number 1: Network online.A lot of people ask me how to network,especially during the covid time,people were not going to colleges,then how should they network?How should they network online?But the truth is, the internethas made everyone come to the same page.You are probably ata one-arm distance fromthe world's topmost intellectualsmartest people who you won't meetin any of the world's top colleges.If you want, you can talkto Elon Musk on Twitter.If you want, you can talkto Bill Gates.If you want, you can talkto top researchers, top sportspeople,top content writers, top marketers,and top developers,you can talk to anyoneif you approach them the right way.So networking online is a way to go.If you are in your late teensor early 20s, you must haveheard about Discord.There are so many powerful serverson Discord, where communitiesof like-minded people are being formed.You can go to Reddit, and interactand engage with like-minded people.You can create forums,write your own blog,create your own contenton Twitter or LinkedIn,and attract a community.All of this is going to make youfar far richer in terms ofopportunities than any top collegeout there.Number 2: Upskill yourself.No matter if your college is not good,you still have a mechanism throughthe internet to learn fromthe best faculty that thereis in the world outside.For example, if you want tolearn Microsoft Excel,then this course on Udemyon Microsoft Excel is a great course.I have done it myself.I have learned the basics of Excelfrom this course and then have gonea step further from it.Such a great course for you toupskill yourself if you want tolearn something new along with college.Another course,The Data Science Course 2022.Data science has become so critical.It doesn't matter if you arestudying economics, or physics,or literature, if you have interestin data science, then this coursecan equip you with everythingthat you need to know arounddata science.If you want to becomea product manager,the world of tech is exploding,we are in shortage of product managers.A product manager is a great roleto play in the tech world.You don't need to become an engineer,if you are it's an advantage,but if you are not,that doesn't mean that youare eliminated,there is no disadvantage.Through a course like this,you can equip yourself inbecoming a product manager.The Complete Financial Analyst course.If you have interest in finance,want to become a financial analyst,you want to work with research companies,data research, stock research,or audit, then a course likethis can really help you getto that point as well.Digital Marketing,such a massive field in today's world.That could be understoodin just 36 hours in this coursewhere 23 marketing coursesare in just one course.This is just a small example.I selected 5 random coursesfrom Udemy where you can upskill yourself,and actually go far beyond your college.Number 3: Send cold emails.Networking online is greatwhen you want to connect with people,but you would need another toolfor that, and that iscold emailing or cold messaging.Cold emailing has been sucha big determinant ofmy success in life.I got so many opportunitiesjust because I asked.People don't ask,people just don't ask.And if you don't ask,the answer is always no.This is a very important lessonin my life, and I would love for youto also adopt this lesson.Send cold emails to peopleand send them the right way.I have made a lot of videoson cold emailing,you can check them out.Go through that journey.What should be the subject line?How should be the introduction?What should be the middle of the email?What should be the ending?All of them have a science attachedto them, and if you do thatin a proper manner, you would besurprised and shocked athow far that cold emailwill take you.Yes, you will not get a replyto every email,but you don't want a replyto every email.You want a reply to just one email,and if you have to send 10-20-30 emailsfor that, but in a proper manner,then you will not get just one,but more than one reply,and then you will be sittingon opportunities that eventhe top college students do not get.Number 4: Pick up internships,projects, or side gigs.The best way to learn in life,if you went to a top college or not,is to actually get realhands-on experience.In my team, there are 11 people,and only two of them have a full-time job.The remaining 9 are college studentsor freelancers, and each one of themare not from the best college necessarilyin the country, but each one of themis already earning morethan what the average payoutin their college is,and that is crazy!Some of them are doing six-figureinvestments every month,that's how much they are ableto earn, and that is simplybecause they started interningmuch early,they started picking up projects,they started working with peoplefrom whom they could learn something,and they just went ballisticdoing that.College is overrated, if you look at itfrom an education perspective.College is immensely underrated,if you look at it from an opportunitycreation engine perspective.And irrespective of which collegeyou are in, or you are not ableto go to the top college,you are constantly givingthat as an excuse, not anymore.Start interning,start picking up projects,start creating side incomes,because that is such a great wayto escape from the excusethat you didn't go to a good college.Number 5: Upskill yourself,but in soft skills.If you are a confident communicator,that can change so much about you,irrespective of which collegeyou went to or not.For example, if you look at this course,Communication Skills For Beginners,again on Udemy, such a great32-hour course that will teach youthe fundamentals of communication,so that you get the confidenceand the experience,that you can then displayto be an effective communicator.The Complete Resume, LinkedIn& Get Your Dream Job Course!Looking for a job, especiallycreating the right resume on LinkedIn,and approaching people, is an art.Some people do it so well,and it's not necessary that allof them are from the top colleges.In fact, most people are notfrom top colleges who areso good at selling themselves.This course teaches you exactly that.Personal Branding.If you are able to createa personal brand online,then you naturally attract people.I still remember, there was an intern,he was probably a 3D artistor animation UX/UI artist,who made a video for Cred,and then he posted it on LinkedIn,and that became his job application.It caught the attention of peoplein Cred, and I am led to believethat he got an internshipor a job in Cred.That is such a great exampleof using your personal brandto create opportunities.Was he from a top college?Nobody even knows.Nobody even cares.His work was so goodand he used a brilliant mediumto get to that point,and that's it!It changed everything!Ninja Writing: The Four LevelsOf Writing Mastery.If you are a powerful, clear,concise, comprehensive writer,that changes everything for you.And this course teachesyou exactly that.And then finally,Presenting With Confidence.If you can present properly,confidently, and comprehensively,in a way where people canunderstand you easily,then you have a superpower.Because everybody has ideas,but very few people have the way,the experience, the art ofcommunicating that idea.And frankly, it doesn't needfor you to have gone toa great college to learn this skill.It's available on Udemy.All these courses are availableon Udemy during a great sale period.You can see the attractive price pointsalready on your screen,plus if you buy these coursesthrough

lot of other people as well.Thank you for that!Number 6: Beat the top collegekids through early investing.Answer correctly,what is the actual differencebetween the top college kids and you?It's not like, they areextremely smarter than you,or they are more hardworking than you.Usually, it boils down tothe financial opportunitiesthey sit on.Their average jobs give themmore salary, their average incrementsare more, and you just feelthat you don't have all thoseopportunities whicha top college kid has,because they started ata base bigger than yours.Do you know how you can defeat that?Start investing and createa better return than them.If you start investing early,while they are partying,and spending their moneyon a great car, or great clothes,or dining out or stayingat expensive places,then you are the smarter person,because of course,they would have more moneythan you at the age of 21-24,but by the time you are 30, you will befar richer than they ever will be,because you have a 10-year headwaywhich they didn't have and you tookthe smarter decision.I would love for you to becomethat person.Fun fact: If you start investingfrom the age of 20,and did it till the age of 60,and if you start investingfrom the age of 30 till the age of 60,with the same amount investedand the same return generated,at the age of 60,if the one who started investingat the age of 30 would have â¹100,then the one who started investingat age of 20 would have â¹200.Double amount!The 20-year-old person would havetwice as much money asthe 30-year-old person.This is the differencethat 10 years bring.There is no need to go toa top college for this,you just need brainsand early investing.And finally number 7: Read.If you read books,you can beat any personon earth because the truth is,books have everything thatwe study in top colleges.All the stories, all the theories,all the practicals,everything that the worldhas witnessed is in front of youin the form of books.If you spend money,and wisely so on books,then you can learn from people'slives, their experiences,their failures.For the cost of less than a pizza,you actually get to learnso much about someone's life.Please read!Read as much as you can!At the end of it, these 7 waysare just the start ofhow you would want to think aboutyour career,but nothing will beat the factthat you have confidence in yourself.At the end of it, while lookingin the mirror if you always feel that,'I have some shortcoming.I am not from IIT or IIMor Delhi Universityor Bombay-Bangalore Universityor a top college,I won't be able to do anything.'Then you know what?You are correct, you genuinelywon't be able to do anything.But if you standin front of the mirrorand convince yourself that,'How does it matter if I amnot from a top college?How does it matterthat I didn't score good marks?It is not a reflection ofhow capable I am.It is a reflection of whatI could not achieve atthat point in timebut I am still capable of achieving.'Then you will be right.You will go so far aheadthat people will be surprisedthat did not go to a top college,and that will be my wish for you.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
