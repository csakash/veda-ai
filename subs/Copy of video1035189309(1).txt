In today's episode of Money Talks,I have with me, Manish Pandey.I know Manish Pandey since the daysof Josh Talks.He played a very important rolein the entire conceptualization,upbringing, and still continuesto play a very critical role inhow Josh Talks become a big thing and how.But what you may not know is thatManish is actually the man behindthe success of so many successfulYouTube creators.Millions of people experiencethe hard work of Manish indirectlyon a daily basis,because he is genuinely the manbehind the scenes who has helpedpeople understand YouTube.I am his student.When we did not know anythingabout YouTube, Manish helped us.He taught us all he knew very efficiently,and it is because of him that allthat we know about YouTube,we have been able to implement that,so it is a privilege to have Manishon the podcast.Thank you Manish for joining me today.Thank you Ankur, you are very very kindwith your words.I was pondering a little bita few days back,and I've been getting this a lotfor the past 6-8 months,that I have mentored this personand that person.The way I see this,and I discussed this with Ranveer as well,I was like,'It is time to put it in the past.Let's do something new, right?Because how can we keep talkingabout one deed.'Something new is brewing up Ankur,I will update you soon.I am thinking of doing somethingthrough which the content creatorsof the 2nd-3rd generation get some help.That's what I want to work at,because all of you are successful,you have arrived.So yeah, but very grateful.If I have taught something,I have learned a lot as well, so yeah,thank you so much for everything.Thank you, man!Your humility is your biggest strength,because you have genuinely helped peopleso altruistically,because genuinely there was nothingthat you were getting out of it,you were never even in the front face,so I owe a lot of our success to you,and thank you.I am very excited about your next stint,because something is always workingin your mind.Manish, the first questionthat I always ask all my guests is,I know a little bit about your life,how was your growing-up experience,specifically when it comes to money?Did you grow up with money or not?And how did that shape upyour relationship with moneyin your early years?So Ankur, the way I would liketo answer this is that I was actuallyvery lucky, because my conditionwas not too good but again,it was the story of 90% the country.So I feel everybody is like this only,the whole country lives like this only,because where I used to liveand the people around me,their needs and our needs were the same,so we were always working towardsmaking the ends meet,and that used to feel likeour whole world.So the journey was very humbling,but as I grew up,as I started understanding things,that self-respect is something too,nobody can just get awaywith saying anything to you,and when I zeroed it down,the answer to everything was money.Something or the other is happeningdue to poor financial condition.So I started making mini goals,like how will we finish this,and whatever kept coming in front of me,I kept doing that, and that was importantat that point in time, so I did that,whatever I did,I don't want to say much here,I have set a lot in many talkshere and there,so I am not left with much to sayand I don't want to dilute it.So that is how it was.I didn't grow up with a lot of money,but then eventually now,everything is fine, all is good.I love this thing that since you were notaware of what happens around the world,you thought that whatever limited exposureyou have, that is the entire world,and everybody faces the same struggleand experiences in their life.When you realized it, and as you said,that somehow money came out to bethe answer for everything,what was your first reaction?Was it anger, disappointment,was it like 'why us?What do they have that we don't?'Capability or hard work, what wasthe overarching emotion in your head?Ankur a mix of, I don't know fromwhere did it come in my mind that,'Dude, you know what, you can also havewhat they have, you'll have to work hard,how and what can be figured outbut let us take one day at a time.'So I didn't get enraged,I didn't get arrogant,I didn't get angry,I didn't get jealous that I want thisby hook or by crook.I wanted it, but I wanted it at my timeproperly, honestly, and come what may,I will get it.So, this was my attitude,and I did thing one day at a time.And at a very young age,I said to my father,'You don't have a son, you have a brother,and both the brothers will work together.'That's what I said.Really?Yes.I remember I was in the 8th standard,that's when I said it,because I started earningthat time itself,and I told my father,'You don't have a son, you havea younger brother,and both the brothers will work outsomething together.'And that's how I started.What was his reaction?My father was not educated,so he used to take time to process things.He was a security guard, a watchmanin a factory,so he didn't understand what I was saying,he used to say,'Do what you deem fit.'That's what he always used to say.That's beautiful, that's really beautiful!Yeah, a few things he said like,'Don't do something that we feel ashamedof facing each other.'So I always kept that in mind.I think he said a lot in justthat one small thing,and I understood what he was saying,so I kept that in my mind.Absolutely!When you think about the upbringingthat your parents have given you,and the world that you have grown up in,do you think it gave youthe right training to win?Because I think, and I could be very wrong,Manish, I think you have a passionwhich is rarely seen in people,so I am trying to understandthat is it by birth,or is it built because of the environmentthat we are in,and then we can adopt it in our life?Ankur, the good thing was that somehowI got myself admittedin Kendriya Vidyalaya,at least in 8th-9th standard,so all my friends and their parentswho used to pick and drop them,they used to come properly,I mean they had the culture of wishinggood morning good evening,they had the culture of hugging children,we didn't have it, I have never done it,I don't remember if I have everhugged my parents.I used to think that even the values comewith good financial condition,it is like a luxury,that's why I used to think thatwe are good in our conditionand they are good in their condition.I wanted to jump from here to there,so I have to do something.So I was struggling to make that jumpso that I could also behavein the same manner,and I might have to teachmy parents that this is alsoa way to live life,so this was the setup, Ankur.Brilliant, man, very nice!Do you remember when you started earning,and you started earningat a very young age,what did you do with your first income?Ankur, it was â¹1,260, I clearly remember.Actually, I would say, it was tuitionfor â¹60, but if you talk aboutrecurring income which comesevery month for a year,we consider that as an income source,that was â¹1,260 fixed every month for me.I used to get it by giving tuition,I used to teach 4 children.There was a straightaway calculationfor that money.My father used to get somethingaround â¹1,300, and I used to get â¹1,260,and I used to money ordermy â¹1,260 straight away tomy mother and sister,because my mother and sisterwere in the village.We had a trend of money order,we used to fill that long formand write a short message at the bottom,we used to write whatever was requiredfor that month and send it.So this was the sequence.And when I shifted to Navodaya Vidyalaya,that was a full-fledged hostelby the government,I used to get only the summer vacationand Diwali break,I used to go to a factory at that time,and factories have a daily wage system,â¹70 per day, but instead of daily,I used to collect itat the end of the month,and I used to take that money back with meas pocket money, that's how it wasin 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th standard,so this was the set up for these 4 years.Then after the 12th, I did my things,I mean then I came intothat professional thing thatI started with a call center.Whatever I earned,it used to directly go into the family.I don't remember if I bought anythingfor myself or did anything for myself,I don't remember.Do you spend on yourself now?Big time!What, tell me, please?Let me tell you, Ankur, I don't know,this is god's blessing, it's likea set up by the universe,now I have money to spend on myself,but whatever I want to buy,somebody gifts it to me.You can't imagine, yesterday nightI was talking to a friend, I said,'Should I buy an Apple watch?I have an iPhone, I have Mac,you guys talk about the ecosystem,should I also come into it?'I had simply thought about it.Ankur, this morning, there isa very good friend of mine,I don't know how,he was not even in the scene,he sent me an Apple watch as a gift.I asked him, 'what is this?'He said,'You did something for me 1.5 years back,you didn't take any money,so this is for you.'I was like, wow!That is awesome!You know Joey in the series 'Friends',I think the actor's name is Matt Le Blanc,he said a similar thing in an interview,'When I was a struggling actor,I did not have the money to buy things,and today when I have money,people keep gifting it to me.'Correct.It's like only those people geta loan who can afford that thing.It's just the way it is.I totally understand that.So tell me, after completingthe 12th standard,when you decided to shift out to a city,was that something which youhad already decided in your mindthat nothing will work outwhere you were living,so it was necessary to move outto change the orbit?So in the 12th standard,while my friends were filling up formsfor IIT-JEE, or PIPMT,I completed my 12th in 2006,so that time, IIT, and JEE were popular,and some friends were filling outNDA forms who wanted to goin the Indian army,I could not even think aboutwasting money in forms at that timebecause I knew nothing will happen,though it's a different thing thatone of my friends filled my form for IIT.So in the second half of the 12th,I started enquiring about Bombay or Pune,since I was in Palghar at that timewhich is near Bombay,so what is it that I can do there,what job can I get there after 12th?I knew how to do 2 things,either give tuition or work in a factory.I didn't want to work in a factory,I knew that if I get intothe loop of a factory,then that loop will never end.So I asked around.So I had a Chemistry sir,Waghmare sir in school,he told me about the concept ofcall centers because he used to livein Malad, Bombay,and Malad was a hub of call centers.So he told me that I can either workin Malad or Pune, since Pune alsohad a culture of call centers.I don't know why I was not confidentabout moving to Bombay, I used to feelthat Bombay is a big cityand I was not sure about myself.So I went to Pune,and then I figured out from there.Literally, when I stepped downat the railway station,that's when I figured out where to go.So, it's a different story, Ankur,I'll tell you all about itwhenever we meet.I would love to know!And Manish, were you never scaredthat you didn't go to college,you don't have that kind of education,I'm sure your friends got admissionsomewhere or the other, and you startedyour life with a job?Ankur, I didn't get the time to think,how will I get scared?!I didn't get the time to think only!You get scaredwhen you have the luxury of time, and all,I didn't have it!For me, it was like,I have to do whatever I was getting,it's good for today hence just do it.So that was the attitude and I kept at it.It's not like I didn't try.Once I tried, when I was workingin an international call centerafter hard work of 1.5 years,I tried to go for IGNOUor apply to a college and say,since I had science in 11th and 12thand I was good at studies,so I had a good percentage,so I always had it in my mindthat if nothing, at least I should do BSc,I'll do science,so I thought of going to collegeand asking if I can take up a systemwhere I'll just come to give exams,but then I got to knowthat you have to come for practicals,you have to attend practicals,so I did try.It's not like I didn't take admission,I did take admission to Wadia Collegein Pune, but I couldn't go therefor more than four days,so that's where it stopped.I got to know in 4 daysthat it's not my cup of tea.You couldn't manage it.You had a full-time job, right?Yes, full time, the whole night.I'm a little too honest as well,so my shift started at 9 o'clock,I used to reach at 7:00,and the shift was from 9-6,but I have to come back at 9.Why?Because after the shift ended,we had to make MIS, report,and all that work,I befriended my team leader,and it is a very interesting story.My team leader used to likea lady in another team,so he wanted to spend time with her,and I thought of it as my opportunity,I went to him and said,'Sir, I know you like so and soin so and so team,and you are not getting the time,so let's do one thing,you spend time with her,and you teach me this work,I will do it on your behalf.'And Ankur I'm telling you,I learned everything about everything,MIS, report, etc.I learned everythingand I started executingthe manager's work as an agent.Wow!And as I got an opportunity,I gave IGP, and there was a rulein Zensar that once you complete a year,only then you can give IGP,but I worked around on thingsand met the head of the call center,I pleaded to them, and said,'I've been here for 5 months only,but I want to give IGP, I know the job.If I fail, then do not promote me,but if I pass, you will have to do it.'I gave it, and I was in the top three,and I became the assistant team leaderwithin 5 months.Now the greed behind it was good.Who wouldn't want to jump fromâ¹13,500 to â¹17,500?!So I was certain to do it,and that's how I did it, Ankur.That is incredible, man!I love it!What a great story!That is so amazing!And then at what point did you feelthat this game has a limit,you should explore something else,how did you even get intowhat you are doing today?So after 4 years of call center,the last leg of the call center,the last one year, it was not actuallya call center.I was always in outbound,I was doing sales,so I used to think of inboundas swindling like if you get a call,you say,'Hi! How may I help you?'I used to think of it as swindling,no work at all.So I felt that I should do outbound,do sales, something challenging,so I was always in outbound.My friends used to tell me,'You are doing suicide, you are goinginto outbound, it has a sales target.But I was like,'It doesn't matter, I will do it.It's like MBA, I will learn.'So in the last leg, my managerby the name of Indu Soni,she was very kind to me,she actually changed my life.So she was in business developmentin the company that I worked in.She picked me and asked me,'Would you work as a gatekeeper for me?Would you actually do data perspectivefor me?'That means finding out peoplewith female IDs, writing them cold emails,getting an appointment from them,fixing an appointment for me,and then I'll go and talk.I thought, let's do this.Ankur, by that time, I got a hangof LinkedIn as well.So I posted whatever I was doingon LinkedIn very loosely.I do this...this...this,I wrote everything,I even wrote that I create excel sheets.So what happened one day,this is a comedy story.I got a message on LinkedInfrom a digital marketing company, saying'We are looking for a so-and-so person forthis profile, and your profile matches.Will you apply?'And the question I asked was,'Is it a day job or a night job?'The other person got baffled by whatI was asking.They said,'It's a day job, why?'I said,'The reason is that I've been workingin a call center for the last 4 years,and I'm tired of doing this night shift,and also my health was taking a hit,because I was not eatingvery healthy food.'We used to eat vada-pav and all that.And you know that if you arenot sleeping in the night,you are not getting melatonin,all of your body goes for a toss,so that's how I switched toa digital marketing company,and started doing pre-sales for them.Ankur, my life changed from there.Incredible!Did you get confidence as well?A lot of confidence.I already had confidence,but I gained a lot more.One thing was that I moved toa different environment,and then I saw that different thingswere done here.I got introduced to thingslike website making, SEO, PPC,and all of that,and that was completely new for me.So all my previous experienceswent down to 0,and I had to restart from 0.But yeah, they showed confidence in me,and I knew how to call and lure theminto giving an appointment,so I used to do that for them.So that's how things started moving,and then one day my boss came and said,'Bro, we are a digital marketing company,we make websites, SEO, this was in 2011,social media was a new in thing,we need to be on top of that,so let us to social media.'So my CEO and I self-coached ourselvesfor social media,and we used to work mostly forreal estate companies, Pune hasa huge culture of real estate,so we used to work for real estate,and whenever we used to makea website or a landing pagefor any company, we told themthat you need a Facebook page as well.And then we used to give themall the wisdom after watchingthe videos of Gary B and Grant Corden.'You will not get this,you will not have an edge.'I used to make a sale.So what used to happen was,if the account is for about â¹1-1.5 lakhs,then social media got added to itfor another â¹30k-40k.My boss used to see that I am ableto recover my salary, so I was doing well.So I knew what was going onin my boss's mind,but it was a good setup, so I kept at it,and I kept learning.At this time, 100% of your salaryor whatever was left was sent home,or was it put to some other use?No Ankur, what started happening was,that time, I think in 2011-12,I had shifted my parents to a flatfrom the slum where we used to stay,because I wanted to givea clean independent toiletto my parents and my sister,she was also growing.So basically, I used to send home â¹15,000,because my salary was â¹27,000,and the remaining â¹8k-9kwas enough for me,my rent was â¹3k-3.5k,and since it was a one-room-kitchen,and I got it for â¹4k-4.5k in Pune.It was close to my office,I always make sure to takea house near the office,so that you can go there walking, right?So I used to find a house aftera lot of effort.And I don't have any personal expenses, 0.Food expenses and phone bill,there are no other expenses besides that,and at that time even this wasn't there,though now we do a lot more fun things,go out to eat with friends and all that.So, my point is that I was able to saveâ¹4k-5k per month at that time, Ankur.Sometimes â¹2k-3k, sometimes â¹4k-5k,if I got an incentive every three monthsor a bonus for Diwali,so I used to save that,so at the end of the year,I used to have around â¹25k-30kin my account.That's beautiful, man!What a story?!From there, if I talk about now Manish,because of your hard work, of course,a lot of luck, and the wishes ofso many people who have wishedwell for you,you have reached a stage wherea lot of people call you a mentor,you have been exposed to so much,what is your view of money today,what is the value of moneyin your life today,going back to the kid was growing up whorealized that money is important in life,money is important for the world?Money is a very magical thing.If you have it, there is a problem,if you don't have it,then also there is a problem.I think money and the concept of money,since the world works on that,it works on trade,you will get something when yougive something,that's how the materialistic world works.So I think money is very very important,extremely important,but money is not everything.That I have understood,and I want to keep myself aware of thisall the time that not everythinghas to be about money.As per your needs,Ankur this works for me,I am speaking only for myself,others don't have to apply,they don't need to be inspiredor motivated or even take my suggestion.I think you should makeand you should understandwhat is enough for you,and decide your enough.Whatever your enough is!If your enough is that you wantto be bigger than Elon Muskand Bill Gates,then that is your enough,you should pursue that.But you have to decide your enough,and then work towards that honestly.And if you get your enough honestly,then that's great.So I have understood what my enough is,and I make that much only Ankur,and the rest keeps happening.That is beautiful!As you were speaking,I thought of an anecdote,I don't know who, but there wasa high-flying party somewhere,and all the billionaires and millionaireswere there, and the usual was going on,air kisses and cheers and all that.There was a person ina corner sitting calmlyand watching everything,so a friend of his comes to him and says,'Why aren't you minglingwith all these people?It will make a difference in your life.'And then he says,'It's because I have somethingthat they don't have.'And the friend then asked,'What is that?'He says, 'I have enough.'And I think that is such a powerfulfeeling to know that you have enough,it's like the hardest thing to get to,but when it happensthen your life can change.So true, man!So what is the motivation today?What makes you get up every day?What is it that Manish is going after?Ankur I look forward to this,this was a very difficult question for meafter a point in time,what motivates me now?And you know that story where Supriyaand I spoke, and I said,'What else can we do in Josh?We will have to get better peoplethan us.'That is why people like Dev Arpanare coming in,you see the updates, right?So, it's doing well.So I was thinking about what should we do.And the answer I got was, and the answer,you know Shobhit kept saying thatand I think that's why it wasin our subconscious mind,impact.Do everything that makes an impact.When we talk about â¹30,000,household income, 90%,let's make it from 90% to 80 or 70,so that makes me wake up.And yesterday I was talking to some peoplefrom the developer community, and I said,'We keep crying aboutthat India's technological talentare not hireable,and then companies have to hire them,and spend a lot of money to coachthem first, and then put them on the job.'They said,'Isn't it possible that we do somethingand enter it in the third year itself?'And then we said that you need to learn3-4 additional things, and work hard.And Ankur, extremely lucky now thatI have access to people like youand others, and I was sitting ina group where all the CTOsof billion-dollar type companieswere present, I said,'If you people can somehow manageto take out even one day in a month,and work on this, I will do allthe hard work and you just guide me.'So Ankur, I keep doing things like this,some nonsensical things,there is no end and no start,things seem to be larger than life,so that's what I think and work on.Like the trend of teaching Englishwhich we are doing in Josh skills,English is not a language, it is a skill,the work done by Ranveer,so a peg behind all this is the motivationto wake up every day.Wonderful, man!You know what Ankur,I need to practice brevity,I think I speak too much.Not at all, man!Such stories give birth to other stories,and I feel that in the world of Twitterand startups,the focus is on saying everything ina concise form rather than in a paragraph,but I genuinely feel that if your storyhas an emotion that can connect,then that story can give birthto many more stories.I love listening to these stories!If you approve, it's passed.Because I have been very consciousabout this.I think I give too much context,is it even required?Absolutely it is, 100%!Please don't ever stop!At least don't stop unless asked,don't stop yourself.Great!Towards the end of the conversation,I have 2 questions, actually 3,we will do it in a rapid-fire modeso that it is more fun.Yes.The first one, Manish, what do you thinkwill be the most expensive thingthat you will ever buy in your life?Joy!Come on, don't be philosophical!I want a factual money-based answer.Do you wantf a materialistic answer?Yes.Ok, let me tell you, Ankur,it's my desire, there is a camera by Sony,it has two lenses, the total costof that kit is â¹28 lakhs,I want to buy that.That camera is for wildlife photography.The day this video launches,somebody will send it to you as a gift,so many people will be watching.Nobody will send such an expensive thing,come on, not so expensive!I am not Shahrukh Khan that somebodywould gift me a car, Lamborghini, and all!Who knows, man!Awesome!Ok, the second question, Manish,you have two options.Option one is that you will getâ¹50 crores today.Yes.Option two is that whatever you knowin life today, you will get all that,but you will be 20 years old.So you will go back in time knowingeverything that you know today.What would you choose between these two?â¹50 crores.Wow!This is very interesting!I thought that you will choose this,but I want to know why.Because if I go back to being20 years old,I know I will do some thingsthat a 20-year-old does,so I'll take â¹50 crores,and do something good with thatmoney in life.I will create a fund that will gotowards wildlife conservation.I will look for more Manish and Manishalike me, and fund their education,I mean, do great things like that.I will come to people like you,and ask what can be done withall that money and do somethingwonderful together.That's how it is.That's brilliant, man!Very few people think like that,and money has a lot of powerif it is in the correct hand,and that is something at leastI have learned in life.Ok, a third and final question Manish.What would you choose between speedand perfection?Speed.Why?Perfection comes on the way.In the pursuit of perfection,like in my story,if I would be chasing perfection,then I don't know about myself,let's not even go there.I mean there is nothing like perfect.People who chase perfection, like,'I want this, this is how it should be.'It's nothing, just keep moving.The maximum you will live is till70-75-80, it's very less time,it's way too less time,do as much as you can,like Raj got trolled after sayingsomething like a 26-hour day.I want a day to be of 26 hours!Can we do something?Do you know Elon Musk?We will do something!And the day it happens,we will get to know.Just remember that I will be the onewho got it done.Awesome!Wonderful, man!It was a lot of fun!I love the honesty and the transparencywith which you always engage and interact.It's really nice because very few peopleare able to share everythingthat they have learned and experiencedin their life with so much clarityand an open mind.So thank you so much, Manish,for joining us, it was a pleasure!Ankur, you didn't ask me anythingabout investing?Ok, tell us, please tell us.I remember that you startedyour investing journey very late,but tell me how are you investing now?Where and how?Ankur, now I am rich, ok,I have a lot of money!So now I have an advisor, ok.Because I tried to do some thingsby myself,when we both were working together,I used to listen to you and triedto do a few things,and then I understoodthat it's not working,flukes don't work,and then I also understoodthat what works for Ankurwill not work for me.So I found an advisor in Bombay,they work with my friends as well,it is a proper firm.I told them that I don't have croresbut this is what I have,if you will do this thenyou can take a fee from me,and I will also help youin building your personal brand.So by giving this greed,I have those people who take careof big people, and now they do it,so Ankur, I have no tension now.That's brilliant!Financial Advisors working for you!Ankur, I am a big man now!I know, absolutely, amazing!I often say,if you do not understand investing,that should not be the reasonwhy you don't invest,because many people are ready to help.Also Ankur, I've a very stupid checklist.Like, it should not bea cigarette company,it should not harm the environment,I don't know,the people who were talking to megot upset.I thought at one point,they would tell me to go away,my case was hopeless.So it was a bit difficult to workwith kind of checklist,but I couldn't do it myself.Means, how far could I dig,that they must have leftsome carbon footprint somewhere,because it's there, if I'm a big man,then I'll have my likings,then these are my likings,so in this way, I troubled them.I love it, I love it, man!That is so good!This is a great endingfor this conversation.Thank you again, Manish, it was great fun.And I hope these stories never stop,and many more stories join in.Thank you so much!Thank you Ankur, thank you so much,you have been very kind, bye!Bye!
