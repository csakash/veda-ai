Insurancein association with policybazaar.comas my knowledge partner.In this whole series weâve tried to coverall those insurance products that we all buyand to understand thisâ¦Weâve tried to understand everyinsurance product in this series,what all are the considerations beforebuying and this is the fifth edition ofâ¦We have tried to understand eachand every product of insurance in thiswhole series, life insurance,health insurance for parents,health insurance for yourself,and today we will covercar insurance and bike insurance.Insurance which is mandatory,you cannot escape it, but still,there are so many misconceptions,so many terms about which we are not aware,and through this video,I am going to help you get through them.We will cover 4 things.First, what are the types of insurance in Indiawhen it comes to vehicle insurance,car, or two-wheeler?Second, how does vehicle insurance work?What are the things that areimportant for you to know?Because then the third part which is,when you are buying your insuranceor renewing it, which is the moreimportant part that we will cover,then what are the things you shouldbear in mind before youbuy the right insurance.Finally, how to buy this insurance?We will go online and figure that out.Let's startNumber 1, typesNumber 1, types of insuranceThere are 2 types of, actually 3 types ofvehicle insurance available in India.The first one is Third party Insurance,the second is comprehensive,and the third is pay per usage.AgainIn India there are 2, actually,3 types of vehicle insurance are available.Number 1, Third-party InsuranceNumber 2, comprehensive insuranceAnd number 3, pay per usagePay per usage is a relatively new product,I will lightly touch on it but we will notdiscuss about it in the video becausethere is still a lot that is being uncovered.The first is Third-party Insurance.So Third-party Insurance is when youinsure yourself, that God forbid if youmeet an accident, then the third partywhich means the one you have metthe accident with assuming that isanother vehicle, so you take this insuranceto cover their damages because it is possiblethat you may have to cover their damages,maybe even their injury,or maybe even their deathand you need insurance for thatwhich is called Third-party Insurance.This insurance is mandatory in India,it is compulsory, which means youcannot drive any car or two-wheeler in Indiawithout having valid third-party insurance.Now if you do meet an accident,naturally the other person...Now if you do meet an accident thennaturally some damage has happenedto the other person but your vehiclealso gets damaged, or you may havegot some injury or there may besome other claim that you may wantto take, so for that, there is a second productcalled the comprehensive insurance.Comprehensive insurance not only coversthe other party but also coversyour own personal vehicle damages.This is what usually people end up buying,but then to save money they move fromcomprehensive to third party insurance,because naturally if you are coveringthe other party of their damages,then you will have to pay lesser.We will discuss all of that in the videogoing forward, but it is important toknow that there are these 2 types ofproducts that are available in India.As I said a new product has beenlaunched in the market which iscalled pay for usage,which means whenever you buyan insurance product, and this ismore applicable in 1.5-2 years whenCovid happened when the usage of carsconsiderably reduced, so people realizedthat the car and bike were at home forthe whole year but we got it insurancefor the whole year, so is there a planwhere I can only pay when I am using the vehicle,and hence a pay per usage plan came.As I said it is very early, there are veryfew insurance companies that give it,I do not know much about it becauseI have personally not bought this product,so I am not best equipped to tell you about it.Let's cover the first twoNow the second halfNow the second question, which is,how does this car and vehicle insurancein general work?For this, the most important thing whichis calculated is called IDV,Insured Depreciated Amount.It is basically the value of your vehicledepending on the year you are considering it in.Basically, if you buy a carOnce againThe second question is,how does all of this work?For vehicle insurance which are the thingsthat are important to know,what are the things that you shouldkeep in mind before you start goingto renew your insurance or perhapsbuy your insurance for the first time as well.The most important thing is IDVor Insured Depreciated Value.This is basically the value of yourvehicle at that point in time.Suppose you have boughta car worth â¹5 lakhs.When you bought that car for â¹5 lakhs,then year on year the value of thatcar depreciates after usage.If after 2 years, for instance,the car is stolen, or there's a lossto the car for any circumstances,then it doesn't mean that since youhave insurance, you will get all the 5 lakhs,which you spent 2 years back, no.After 2 years, a car would havean IDV or Insured Depreciated Value.Let's say it â¹3 lakhs, there is actuallya formula which I will show you on the screenbut let's say it comes out to be â¹3 lakhs.That means if God forbid, after 2 yearsyour car is stolen or damaged fully,and you want to take the whole claimfrom the insurance company,then they will give you â¹3 lakhs becauseaccording to them your car's valueafter 2 years is now â¹3 lakhs only.That is what is the basis for everything.Now to calculate IDV, the brandof your car, the model of your car,the year of the making of your car,and where did you register your caror where is the Regional Transport Officeor RTO, these factors come in todetermine the IDV.It's not like you get different IDVsdepending on the car's brand or model,no, but it is a very specific amountbecause it starts with the actualex-showroom price of the vehicle.So whatever would be theex-showroom price of that vehiclewhether it is Maruti Swift or a Yamaha bike,that is a starting point for the IDVbecause year on year your IDVis calculated based on that only.If ever you see an insurance policyof a vehicle, the most important thingin it that you will look have to look at is,what is its IDV?Your premium is decidedon the basis of that.Premium is the amount you will haveto pay to the insurance companyevery year to cover your insurancefor the amount up till the IDV,this was a little confusing, I'll say that again.Premium is the amount that youwill have to pay to the insurancecompany every year so that allyour financial liability up till the IDV iscovered by the insurance company.So simple, let's say your insurance premiumis â¹10000 and your IDV is â¹3 lakhs,then you pay â¹10000 to theinsurance company, and God forbidif your car gets stolen or fully damaged,then the insurance company would giveyou â¹3 lakhs for the â¹10000 premiumthat you have paid.If you meet an accident and thereis some damage due to that,then the insurance company will bearall the expenses for that damage up toa certain condition, which is veryimportant and we will discuss that,so you will have to pay a small partof it but the larger part of that amountof the damage will be paid bythe insurance company.That is why you are paying a premiumto the insurance company.Whenever you buy insurance,then which are the things that are covered?Number 1, theft.As I said, if the car gets stolenthen you can claim that.Number 2, accidental damages.So, if your car or vehicle meets an accident,then all the expenses to repair the damage,to clean it up, the insurance coversthat as well.Third, if any car or vehicle or bike,car or vehicle or bike!Vehicle catches fire, there is an explosion,gets stuck in riots, gets drownedor some other natural calamity occurs,because of which it is destroyed or lost,all of that is also covered in an insurance plan.The financial liability of the third party.So, whoever you have an accident with,then the insurance to cover their damages,which is basically third-party Insurance,is also there in the comprehensive plan,and it is of course there in the third-party.And finally, if you have a comprehensive planthen you also get a personal accident coverwhich means, if you have any injuryor God forbid you meet an accidental death,not you but you get the drift, right?it's a sensitive topic I don't even know how to say it,but if you find yourself in the circumstancesof accidental death, then there isa personal accident cover,to cover that as well, which is a part ofthe comprehensive plan.It is very important to rememberwhich are the things that theinsurance plan does it cover.Number 1, general wear and tear.When you drive a car, if the enginegets damaged, something is wrongwith the clutch, or if brakes fail,all these normal things which we getrepaired while servicing,they are not covered by insurance.If you meet an accident and if the driverdoesn't have a license or if the driverwas under the influence of drugs or alcohol,then the insurance will not cover anything,irrespective of the damage.If you get any such changes doneto your car which disturbs thecar manufacturer's warranty or guarantee.Many times you get some normal spare partin the car instead of OEM by somelocal service station, and if that disturbsthe warranty or guarantee then theinsurance company will not cover thatbecause they know that you have tamperedwith the original car product and that isnot under their purview.And finally, if there is any damage tothe engine because of oil leakage,that is also not covered.So, what are the things that you needto bear in mind, based on all these thingswhen you renew your vehicle insurance?Whenever you buy a new car or a new bike,then mostly the showroom that youare buying it from, they give youa comprehensive plan.Many times some scheme is going on inthe insurance, you get insurance for â¹1or something like that, you should take it,don't think too much because that isthe starting point and of course,it is mandatory, you cannot even drivethe vehicle without and insurance.But at the time of renewal,you have to be very smart.Firstly, do you go direct or do you goback to the showroom or back tothe agency because what is goingto happen is, if you have takenany insurance plan of any insurance companyit is obvious that at the time of renewal,they will contact you,and they will want that you shouldrenew it through them.You can do that if convenienceis what matters.But if you want to pay as less premiumas possible, you want to evaluatewhat are the premium options in themarket or what are the insurance options,what all do they provide, then I wouldstrongly recommend you to do yourrenewal online because you can seeall the policies while sitting at home,you can compare all their features,everything that you need to do,and of course, if there is a schemerunning at that point in time,either through the online companyor through the insurance company,then you can avail that as well.So, it is always the smarter thing to do.I personally have taken all my,right now we have a leased car,but when we used to have cars,then we used to renew all of themonline only. It was just the simplest thingto do, to go to policybazaar.com,scan through the things and just renew it.More often than not, we use to renew itwith the same Insurance Company,but we used to get from schemes,some discounts and it was justhappy money saved because it is a premiumwhich you have to pay mandatorily.So what are the things that youwant to consider?Number 1, it is a good idea totake a Zero-depreciation cover.Now, what is Zero-depreciation cover?When your car's value depreciatesbecause the car was used after theex-showroom price and now it hasreached a certain IDV orInsured Depreciated Value,at that point if you meet an accident,and let's say there were damagesof â¹25,000, then the insurance companywill not pay the whole â¹25000.Depending on what part is damaged,it covers a certain percentageof the total damage value.So this may mean that out of thetotal bill of â¹25000 you may haveto â¹5000 yourself and theinsurance company will pay â¹20000.When you go for a zero-depreciation cover,you basically say, 'I will not pay anything,you as an insurance company willbear everything'. So, you have to thenpay a slightly higher amount but thereis no hassle about what you have to pay,when you have to pay,why you have to pay,depending on what part.We will see all that on the screen.But that is the important partwhich I would strongly recommendto get rid of all the headache,please consider a zero-depreciation cover.The second is engine protection.Because the damage to the enginedue to normal wear and tearis not covered in an insurance productand the engine is the main componentof any vehicle, so there is a protection coverfor the engine as well for the insuranceand if you can then I would stronglyrecommend that also to beyour add-on.And third, please ensure that youget a no-claim bonus in yourinsurance policy.What is a no-claim bonus?If you did not make any claim forthe whole year, then yourpremium reduces.So you basically get a discounton your premium maximum of up to 50%.With no-claim bonus is not availablein some insurance policies, those will notbe the ones that I recommend.Please ensure that in your insurance policy,you get NCB or no-claim bonus,because if you don't make a claimin a certain year from theinsurance company, then you should geta benefit for your good behavior.And finally, as I said please try tobuy it directly because by doingthat you can save yourself fromthe commission given to the broker,which you are not even aware of,it is hidden somewhere in the premium.The lowest premium will always comewhen you buy or renew yourvehicle insurance directly.That is why policybazaar.com.Let's see how it worksVery simple! Very intuitive!You can instantly buy or renewyour car insurance or two-wheeler insurance,and you will be able to compareeverything that you need to.Let's see how it works.All right and now let's go to the car insuranceSo you go to policybazaar.com slashmotor insurance slash car insurance,I am doing it for cars only right now,not for a vehicle or two-wheeler.I will just proceed without the car number.Why is the car number important?Because that determines your RTOor Regional Transport Office whichwill then determine how will it be.So let's say Delhi, DL3,and then you have a Maruti,let's say it's an Alto, petrol version.Let's say it is LX 796 and the making is 2018.Full name, since I am Shahrukh Khan,so Shahrukh Khan here.This is not my number,so please do not call.It can be somebody else's,so please do not call.And then you view the pricingAnd when does the policy expires,it is very important.If your policy has already expired,then it is possible that your premiumincreases so always renew your policybefore the expiry date.The good thing is if you do it beforehandthen your policy starts from the day thatyour policy expires. So don't thinkthat if your policy is expiring on20th August and you have renewed iton 15th August then your 5 days are gone,no, it will start from 20th August only,it's just that you have got it before.So let's say it starts from 20th August.Did you make a claim in your existing?So I will say, no, because I want totake a no-claim bonus, and thenwe will start going and figuring it out.Now you will see that the first thingthat emerges is your IDV.There are multiple people who are saying,what is IDV?Now it's may seem that,'Wow! Because of less IDV...It may seem like,'Wow! Because of less IDV we will haveto pay less premium, so let's select less IDV',but you have to bear in mind that if God forbidyour car gets stolen, or fully damaged,or you meet an accident, then you getthe claim according to the IDV.So if your Alto get stolen, then if youbuy this insurance you will get onlyâ¹96000 whereas if you buy this insuranceyou will get â¹145000. Of course, to buythis you have to pay more money,but when you look at the amount,it's not significant.Like, â¹2560 and â¹2650 is notsuch a big difference, something thatyou should bear in mind.Now we will go into policy detailsand this is where it becomesvery important.So standard coverage, includesdamage to the car, theft of the car,damage to the third party as I said,natural calamities, man-made hazards,and all those things.And then you will go to what's not covered.And then this is a very important thingwhich is a very good feature in Policybazaar.How much will the insurer payif you make a claim?So, find outIf you see, this is where it becomes interesting.Repairs only, ok, they will pay 100%of remodeling value, but to replace parts,for some the insurer will be 100%,for some 70%, if it is the cost forpainting material, then only 50%needs to be paid. Cost of replacing plastic,rubber, nylon parts 50% to be paid.So it basically is not going to give you theentire bill amount of all your damages,it is only going to pay 70% or 50%.That is why if you add zero-dep,which is for â¹949 for this one,by the way, I am not recommendingthis insurance policy, I am justshowing you how it works,suddenly 100% of everything thatyou claim will be paid for you.So you will not have to spend anythingpersonally, for â¹949 per year,which is nothing, of course for this car,you are getting zero depreciation,which I would strongly strongly recommend.One important point, you will have topay a compulsory deductionof â¹1000 per claim, because it is thesame for every insurance company.You have to pay â¹1000 minimumfor processing irrespective of theclaim amount or if you havezero-dep or not.So you will see that there are allof these options that you can consider.Everyone has all the details possibleso you can figure out what youwant to do.Navi insurance is for â¹3500,you can figure out what is covered,what is not covered, so on and so forth.So everything would be transparentlyshared in front of you and you canthen decide what is it that you wantto go for through this online mediumbecause this is the fastest, and the simplest,also almost the cheapest way to renewyour car insurance, or vehicle insurance,or of course, also to buy one.If you have any questions regardingvehicle insurance then pleasedo let me know.There is a veryThere is a very good page that I havelinked in the description andcomment, where you willget to know all the things thatI told you in this video includinghow does the depreciation work?There is a wonderful page onpolicybazaar.com on car insurancewhich has all the detailsthat I covered in this video includinghow does the IDV gets calculated?Which is right here, right?So you can see this table is here,which will tell youhow your IDV is calculated basisyour ex-showroom price when youbought that car or two-wheeler?I hope this was useful.Every Tuesday, every Thursday,every Saturday, a video on thisYouTube channel, if you want to benotified about that video, then pleasedo not forget to subscribe.Ankur Warikoo signing off!
