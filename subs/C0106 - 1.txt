Twitter,he is an entrepreneurbut also a deep thinker.So there is a person who has gatheredall his tweets, all his thoughts,and written a book which is calledthe almanac or a diary of Naval Ravikant.Beautiful book because it again throwsat you the realities of life,simple truths that we all are aware of,but when we hear them again,it just hits us hard.It's a very recent book,but it's a

writtenabout money but very few have stood thetest of time, and this is one such book.Please pick it upif you want to become smart,intelligent, and aware aboutpersonal finance and money.Number 9: Atomic Habits.One of my favorite books of all times,because it tells you that eventhe smallest habits can give youa big result.And it is such a simply written book,and yet such a powerful way ofthinking about life,where we think thattill the time we don't do anything big,there will be no big change in our life.No, not necessarily!Small habits, atomic habitscan lead to mega results.Number 10: Psychology of Money.I don't you have caught that.The author of Psychology of Money,Morgan Housel,I recently did a podcast with him,which was brilliant and I loved it,and I would want you allto read this book.It doesn't talk about how to make money,it talks about the nature of money.What is the psychology,what is the character of money?If you do not realize that,you will end up not understandingand thus respecting it.In this video, I am sharingmy 30 best reads with you,with the hope and belief that every personshould read these 30 books in their lifeat least once,and because I

will announce the result,and I will respond on your commentfrom my handle,and we'll ask you to write to us by email.Let's continue.Number 11: Rework.I read this book for the first timein 2009, and it changed my life.It redefines and challengesthe notion of work.What is the importance of workin our lives,and how can we havea new perspective on it?Something which is very powerfuland has stayed with me all these years.This is my most gifted book of all time.I have given around 150 copiesof this book to peopleover the last ten odd years.Number 12: Attitude is Everything.You must have heard a lot of times,it doesn't matter what you know,it doesn't matter how much you know,it doesn't matter since how long you know,what matters is your attitude aboutknowing, learning, learning new things,proving yourself wrongand learning from it,and this book just defines that.Must read particularly for peoplein their 20s,because that is when most of our attitudesget shaped up in our life.Number 13: Rich Dad Poor Dad.Again, one of the classicswhen it comes to money.A story about two fathers.One who remained poor despite workingvery hard all their life,and another one who became richbecause they thought about moneyvery differently.It's an American book,so all the concepts will not applyto the Indian situations,but the fundamentals remain the same,and they don't change about money.'Psychology of Money','Rich Dad Poor Dad',and 'Think and Grow Rich',if you combine these books,you will get everythingthat you need to become the wisest personyou know about money.Number 14: Factfulness.Do you think that the worldis getting destroyed year after year?We are going througha very difficult time.It seems like everythingis getting ruined,there is so much poverty in the world,floods in so many places,too much terrorism,too much political divide,religious divide, so on and so forth.This book challenges all those notions.Factfulness is a very factful way to seehas the world truly improved over years,and the answer is yes.We might be living inthe best period of this world,where there are lesser fights,poverty is the least,literacy is the most,health is the best, so on and so forth,so this is a really nice way of lookingat facts and feeling optimisticabout the world,despite the fact that there isup and down every day,but at a zoomed out period level,the world is only going upwardsand improving and progressing.Number 15: Mindset.One of my favorite books of all times.You must have heard offixed and growth mindset.If not, then it was introducedfor the first time in this book.A fixed mindset is a mindsetthat says that the capabilitythat I was born with will remain as it is,that is the maximum I can do.And growth mindset saysthat I can do anything.If I set my mind to anything,and give it time, and be patient,then I can achieve anything.And the difference betweenthese two is the differencebetween success and regret.Number 16: Laws of Human Nature.This is a very hard-hitting bookbecause when you read this bookyou will feel that this worldis very scary,because human nature worksin a very strange way.For example, the fact that youdo not make yourself too visible,too popular,you don't present yourself too much,makes people crave for you even more.Now, this is a law, and in a way,it is a story of human nature that,the more difficult it is for usto achieve a person,we find that person more attractive,and that's the reality.So there are a lot of laws of human naturein this book.The book might be a little unsettling.You may think about what it says,and what kind of human beingyou may become if you follow this book.You don't have to follow the book,but you have to be aware ofhow humans work.Number 17: Give and Take.A very beautiful book, and it talksabout two kinds of people in the world.Givers and takers!Those people who give a lotand those people who take a lot.And in the end, it's proven thatthose who give without any expectationto get something back,they are the ones who are most fulfilled,they are the ones who are the happiest.Wonderful read!One of the most powerful readsof this guy called Adam Grant.I would highly highly recommend youto pick this book up.Number 18: Courage to be Disliked.If you can read only one bookout of these 30 books,then this would be the one.It might also be the most difficult bookout of the 30.Because you won't be able toaccept this book.You will feel like this bookis blaming you.And that is how the book is.Courage to be Disliked!To have such strength in oneselfthat it doesn't matter to youwhat people think about you.Isn't that liberating?Isn't that where all of us want to be?And this book,through a wonderful conversation betweena student and a philosopher,will take you on that journey.Number 19:7 Habits of Highly Effective People.A brilliant book that will tell youif you want to be very effective,which doesn't mean most successful,doesn't mean richest,doesn't mean happiest,but most effective, which meansyou create an effect, and impact,by the work that you do.What are the common traits of such people?It all boils down to 7 traitsthat define most of these individuals.Brilliant book!Highly recommended especiallyfor people in their 20s.Number 20: 12 Rules for Life.There are many books likeLaws of Human Nature, 12 Rules for Life,but this is a great book.It's again, a very powerful book.It's a slightly deep read, a long read,but I strongly feel that it should bea part of the 30 booksthat everyone reads.12 rules of life which will tryto explain you life.As I said, in this video,I am sharing 30 books with youthat I think every person should readat least once in their life.I want to give these 30 booksas a giveaway to all of you.How?Number 1:

Write the name of the bookand the reason why you want to readthat book in the comment section.We will select one lucky winnerfor each book.I will reply on your commentthrough my brand handle after two weeks,and you will get the book home deliveredthrough Amazon.Number 21: Linchpin.A book that tells you thatif you want to become indispensableat your work, if you want to reacha position where nobodyis able to touch you,then how is that possible.It is not possible through power,it is not possible through politics,it is possible througha very different mindset,which has been beautifullyshared in this book.Number 22: Outliers.A lot of time data suggeststhat some people become outliers,which means they are able to go away fromthe normal crowd and do something big.What explains that?What explains thatis what this book explains.It's a great book, very interesting,very revealing,I am certain you will enjoy this a lot.Number 23: Meditations.You might read this bookin the later part of your life,because you won't understandthis book in your 20s.But Meditations is perhaps one of the mostpowerful books ever written.This book was writtenaround 2000 years ago,and just imagine, 2000 years agosome person said all these thingswhich apply today as well,because the power of those ideas,the clarity of those ideas is justso strong that it hasn't missed time.Brilliant read but a difficult read!Number 24: Stillness Is The Key.If Meditations is difficult,then Stillness Is The Keyis an easy version of Meditations.It follows the same principle.It has Stoic principles.Stoicism is a philosophy,and that is what Meditations is all about,and Stillness Is The Key is a recentavatar of the concept of stoicism.A really nice read, very powerful,very light read,and definitely impact-inducing.Number 25: Man's Search for Meaning.Through a true story,through a very powerful true story,we are told what is genuinelythe search for meaning in our life.How does the search for purpose comeinto our life?What are we chasing in our lifeand how can we achieve it?It's a very tragic story,but in that tragedy, there is power,there is hope, there is motivation,there is confidence.I love the story, I love the book!Number 26: Shortness of Life.Again, a book on stoicismwhich was written 2,000 years ago.Brilliant, incredibly powerful,and hard-hitting book.A must-read, but maybe in your 30s.Number 29: Malgudi Days.You must have heard of it.If not, people from the 1980s-1990s,must have heard of it,because Malgudi Days used to comeon Doordarshan.It's a wonderful narration ofthe joys of childhood,of the joys of rural India,of the joys of simplicity.And after reading this book,you may start appreciating thingsthat are beautiful and important in life.Number 28: Monk Who Sold His Ferrari.A story about a lawyer who wassick and tired of this world and his job,that he left everything and became a monk,and how his whole life transformed.A wonderful book that one should readparticularly in their 20s.Number 29: Quiet.If you are an introvert,or you think that you are an introvert,then this book is for you.Because in Quiet, the author Susan saysthat introverts are assumed to be uselessin this world.It is assumed that they won't be ableto do anything,they don't have any confidence,they can't even talk to people,and they are hopeless,but there is power in being an introvert.And if you are battlingwith your inner struggle,where you are an introvert,and you don't know how to convert itinto a strength,then this book may bethe right one for you.And finally number 30: Sapiens.I think this is a good number 30to conclude with because this bookassimilates everything.From our beginning of civilizationtill today,whatever has happened with us,how did we become the most dominantspecies on earth,how did the money come about,how did religion come about,and how did the currenttechnological advancements come about,a beautiful story about all thisin the form of a powerful book,that is Sapiens for you.So these were the 30 booksthat I believe everyone should readin their lifetime.Again, I am giving them as a
