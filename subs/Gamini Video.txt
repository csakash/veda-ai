Today Gamini Singlais in conversation with mewho not just cracked UPSC,she achieved All India rank 3.She is in her training right now,and what she did beautifullybefore she went to the trainingis to write an incredible book abouthow she cracked this exam,and how you can also crack this exam.In today's conversation,we'll try to understand Gamini's journeyso that you are hopefully left justas inspired as I was leftthrough her journey.Gamini, thank you so much for joining us.Thank you so much sir, my pleasure.From where are you connecting with us?Right now I am...Actually sir, we are not allowedto reveal that,so if we you could miss that part.Yes, that's perfectly fine.But can you mention thatyou are on Bharat Darshan?Sir, it would be better if I just say thatI am in training right now.It's perfectly fine!So when I ask you this question,and I would love to ask this question,then say it exactly like this.I can't disclose it but all thatI can say is I am a part of my training,and this is it.Is that okay?Yes, that will be fine.Perfect!Gamini, where are you joining us from?Sir, what I can tell you is thatI am undergoing my training right now.I don't think I will be able to disclosewhere I am exactly right now.Just that we are in phase 1of our training.Holding the country's secrets! Wonderful!How long has it been sinceyou started training?So 3 months of foundation coursehas already been completed,and now we are in our phase 1for IAS officers.There were 450 of usin the foundation course,where all the services arein training together.So it's been approximately 3 weekssince this started.Wonderful!Gamini, first of all,we'll try to get to know you.So share with uswhere are you from,where did you do yourschooling and college,tell us about your family.Yes sir.So basically, we are from Punjab,Sunam district in Sangrur,but since I was born,both my parents are doctorsin the Himachal Pradesh Government,so we were in the district Kangrafor some time till I was in 5th standard,and now my parents are workingin district Bilaspur as doctors,and we live in Anandpur Sahibwhich is on the borderof Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.So I can say that I got a mixof both states.I have done my schooling from6th to 10th at Mount Carmel Schoolwhich is in Anandpur Sahib,and then for plus one and plus two,I shifted to Chandigarh,I was preparing for JEE as well,and then I got intothe computer science branchin Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh.Wonderful!So did you want to do engineering yourselfor because of your parents?No sir, it was my choice,although I discussed a lot at my homeabout which option to choose,but somewhere I had it in my mind thatI wanted to go for civil services,so I wanted to keep my options open.So as they say that engineeringis not binding,it opens up options for you,and that's why I thought that engineeringwould be best for me.Wonderful!Very few engineers are able to say this!How was the engineering experience?What did you learn?And what do you wishyou could have learned but you didn't,and what you learned was useless?No sir, I think it wasthe best part of my lifeif I look back and say.Engineering journey or college lifemakes you grow intellectually,but I think you also grow a lot personallywhen you are among a lot which is young.Young innovative minds are there,everybody is thinking in a directionabout what to do in future,so your personal bondings are very strong,you introspect and understand your aimsbetter when you are among that crowd,you meet so many people becauseso many people come in the collegesto deliver lectures.And when I did my internship,I got very good exposure,so I interned with JP Morgan in Mumbaiwhich is an investment bank.Though my background wasin computer science,but I opted for a finance internship,so when you get exposure toa diversity of fields,I think you are able to better decidewhat you want,and I truly cherishmy experience in college.This is very interesting Gamini,because I often tell people thatthe biggest mistake you can makein college is to graduatejust by studying,and there is so much more to collegethat you can do.Tell us specifically about civil servicesand UPSC,because I am assuming thatyou had made up your mindin college itself that you want to do itand prepare for it.So is there something specific thatyou will guide the students for,that by doing these things in college,your potential and the probabilityof success can increase towards crackingthis exam?Yes sir, definitely.So, as I have mentioned in a chapterin the book,particularly about how I chose thatthis was my goal.I think 50% of the work is donewhen you are determinedthat you have to do this.If you start it with any confusion,then I think that's a problemif you start is confusing.So, my advice to people in collegewould be to try diverse optionsfor 1-2 years if you have eventhe slightest confusion,because I had an optionin the third yearthat I could go for a light internshipand start my preparationsand utilise those 6 months in preparation,but what I choose rather was to take upthe best option provided by my collegeby whatever companies coming,I wanted to taste the corporate world,so I took that step that untilI am 120% sure that this is my calling,I will not go for it.So the first mistake that you can makeis entering a world without thinking,where you are looking atshort-term benefits.So that comparison of 5 years-10 yearsdown the line is very important,and it is very important to sitwith yourself and think aboutwhat you want from life,and you will get to know about it onlywhen you explore different options.In college, I did debating also,I was in computer scienceso I tried coding too whetherI am liking it or not,I used to go for MUNs,I was a part of a non-profit organization,I did my internship in finance,so meet as many people as you can,participate in as many activitiesas you can,I think that was really helpful for me.So the first thing is this ishow you decide what you want to do.The second step would be whenyou have already decided,I think college is the best timewhen you can start with the preparationthrough newspaper reading.So reading a newspaper is a habitwhich helps a normal citizenas well an aspirant.So it's not like only a civil servantshould read it.Even if you are confused,start reading newspapers.I started in my 1st year,and it gradually help me so muchthat by the last year,I was confident that I understand things,and I also realized that I find thingsinteresting as well.This is another thing that I would liketo suggest thatif you want to crack exams,then cultivate the habit ofnewspaper reading.Wonderful!I want to ask a questionbased on this, Gamini.You made newspaper readinga medium of your preparation,so was it like you were readinga lot of newspapers in a dayfor different opinionsand different editorials,or you chose only one and madethat your source,please explain this to them?Yes, sir.Here I would like to mentionthat my father helped me a lotwith the newspaper reading part.I used to stick to only one newspaper,The Hindu,and I started reading it in my first year,but if there were certain articlescovered in different newspapers,my father used to send them to me.And I also have a habit where ratherthan reading from 4 newspapers,what I used to do wasif there was any controversial topic,I used Google.For example, if there was any articlein The Hindu which is mentioningonly one side of the topic,then I would make sure thatI would Google the other side of the topicthrough whatever newspaper was there.So I didn't read all the newspapers daily,but I definitely exploreda newspaper further.Great! Very very smart!Sorry! I break your flow!So the first thing was to startexperimenting as much as you can,which is a beautiful advicetowards preparation.Make yourself as much awareand expose yourself as you can towhat is happening in world eventsand national events through newspapers.What else?So the third thing is to go backto basic books.When you start the preparation,you are too excited,you want to complete everything,you just want to get rid of thisbecause you have a lot of adrenaline rushthat now I have decided soI just want to crack the exam.So I think the basics are somewherecompromised in that enthusiasm,and then after 1-2 attempts,you have to come back to basic books,because they are inevitable.So I would say take it slow,take it very patiently,and keep building your conceptualunderstanding through your basic books,be it NCERTs and the specific booksfor specific subjects.So there are no shortcuts to this examand I'm sure,it's not there in any journey.I've been reading a lot,and even in your startup journey,there were no shortcuts.That the primary thingabout this exam also,that if you take some online materialor some material from coaching,and you think that will suffice,that's not the case.You have to read booksat least 4-5 times no matterhow boring they are.So the third advice is to startwith basic booksand gradually keep reading them,if you can give it 3 hours do that,if you can give it 7 hourson the weekends do that,but give the time that it deserves,and give as much time as possible.I think it's not possible to domore than this in college,and you shouldn't even do itis what I think.I so agree with that.And it's beautiful that you already havethis big realization at your age, Gamini,that there are no shortcuts in life.It seems they would be shortcuts to reachwhere you want to reach,but ultimately you have to struggleand work hard which gives youthe highest probability of success,and you are such a great example of that.The books that you spoke about,the basic conceptual first principleunderstanding that you spoke about,some books which you went back toand it really helped you?Yes sir, definitely.So I started with the NCERTs.I still remember, the first subjectI picked was geography,and I read the NCERTs of 6th to 10thand plus 1 and plus 2.So it may seem that why woulda question come from NCERTor how could it help,but let me tell you that UPSC is so smart,that you would not even realize thatone of the four optionswould be from NCERT,and the question will be solvedthrough elimination.So I started with the NCERTs of geography,then the NCERT of polity,and the books by Laxmikantfrom end to end.Again for history, I read NCERTof 6th to 10th,and mainly the ancientand medieval history of 6th and 7th,and then the ancient and medieval historyof plus one and plus twoby R N Sharma sir and Satish sir,and the books by Spectrum.So these were some books thatI read at that time.And I missed some bookswhich I realizedafter I missed the first attempt,and then I went to the economics NCERT,and I did it again which I leftat that time,and that's why I did not clearin the first attempt,and I had to come back to those books.Brilliant! That is so commendable!And what was your study schedule?What was your daily routine?And there is a lot of effort thatyou put towards preparing for this exam,and you have described everythingin this book beautifully,so thank you so much for that,and I will come to that,but if you can broadly describewhat was your routine,and how did you balance collegeand your personal life,preparation for UPSC,help the students understand that better?Yes, sir.So during my 4th year in college,I used to get up a little earlyin the morning, if the collegeis starting at 9 a.m.then I would try to wake up at 6:00 a.m.,and then in the morning hours, I usedto complete my newspaper reading,so I used to give 1-1.5 hoursto a newspaper.After that, if I have any free period,all the lecture was canceled by chance,so students have the tendency to sitin the market and gossip or eat out,but my tendency was either to rushto the library or to my room,and complete a chapter or moreof the book I was reading.After that, by 3 o'clock our collegeused to finish officially,so I used to come back to my roomand sit down for 2-2.5 hours,and then I would go for my walk,I started that in my 4th yearbecause I realized that fitnessis very very important,so a walk of 40-45 minutes,a little bit of break,chit chatting with friends,then again coming and putting 1-1.5 hours,and then I would go to bed a little early,this was along the college.But then obviously it was notas easy after collegewhen I had a full day,and I was in mission-modefor the preparation.So my timetable at that time was,as I mentionedin the second part of the book.I used to get up at 4:30-5 in the morning,and 5-9:30 was my most productive time.I used to sit by myself,nobody was allowed to disturb meif I may say so,and I used to study for 3-3.5 hourswithout taking a lot of breaks,because those morning hourswere very productive for me.Then I would go for a half hour's break,I would be back by 10 o'clock.Then 10-12 was one and a half hoursof studies with two breaks of 15 minutes.Then I would take a good breakof around 1 hour.Then I used to have sittingsof 1.5 hours and start working.And for me, since morning hourswere more difficult,so I used to ease out a littlein the evenings when my parentswere back from the office,so after 4:00 p.m.,I used to take a break of 1.5 hours,go out, take a nap in betweenbecause I used to wake up early,then I used to come back and again doa sitting of 2 hours, and go to bed by 10.So this was my schedule duringthe preparation days after college.And for how long did you followthis schedule, Gamini?It was for 1 year, and before that,during the first attempt,I was taking some classes,I was going through a guidance programin Patiala, and we used to wake up earlyfor that too,be it very cold or be it any weather,so for that also I used to get upat 4:30 a.m. because our class startedat 5:30 a.m.,I still remember it used to beabsolutely dark outside,so I had to get up,I never missed a class,and that class was also from 5:30-10:30,and then the routine wasa little different.So the routine was the same foraround 2-2.5 years witha little bit of difference,depending on when I was homeor taking a class.That is incredible!That is an insane level of commitment!I remember I met Chikki,and Chikki is the founder of Juggernautwho has published Gamini's book,and she was in such awe of you Gamini,because she was like,After reading this book,I've probably seen for the first time,how do students who crack the UPSCgive up so much in life to get there!It's not easy, especially at your age,where your friends must be partying,somebody must be getting a jobor doing something else in life,they are putting photos on Instagram,and all, and you are at it from 5:30in the morning when it's still dark,you are attending classes,and just getting it done.Does at some point, it becomes difficultor self-doubt comes,especially after your first attemptwhen you may have been disappointed,you may have felt dejected,how did you pick yourself up,because I get a lot of inquiriesfrom students who are giving UPSC,given 2-3-4 attemptsbut still not cleared,and now they are strugglingto lift themselves up,that with what motivationwe should again work towardsthe same preparationwhich we have been doing for years?So what stories did you tell yourself,or who were the people who encouraged youand motivated you to get backinto that rhythm?So sir, as you said self-doubt,pressure, guilt, loneliness,these are your constant companionsduring this exam, fear of failing,if I say that I have not facedall these things,I think it will be very wrong on my part,because I think every day you face them.Every single day you feel likewho knows what will happen,because the result of the journeywill come out very late,and one attempt means one year,approximately 1 year.And I had put a lot of effortin my first year,but when I failed the exam miserably,so my margin of 26 marks from the cutoff,I was really very dejectedat that point in time becauseit was not like I did preparation lightly,even after doing hard workand giving my best,I just couldn't crack the exam,so I think your family supportat that time is very very important.My parents, my grandparents,and my brother specifically,so I think Tusharwas of immense help to me,and they made me realize thatI was much more thanwhat I had given in these years,and there is nothing wrong with me,there was something wrong in my strategy.So one thing that every aspirant doesis think that there might besomething wrong with us,or we have lost that spark thatthis exam is not for us,so I just want to say thatit's nothing about you,it's just about the strategyhere and there which has gone wrong.So I understood that,I watched a lot of videos of topperswith an open mind,because I knew there was something wrongsomewhere in my strategy.So it's better than cursing the examor the examination pattern or luck,so sometimes we start cursingthe wrong things,and that's where we enter that cycle.I knew I had to curse myself,and it's very difficult to acceptyour own mistakes, but I sat with a diary,watched every topper's video,and observed the things which I didn't dobecause of which I am not there,and then did all those thingsin the next attempt,and tried not to miss anythingbecause I knew the stakes were too high.So family support,your friends' support that you can do it,your self-confidence,and acceptance of your mistakes,I think these are very important thingsto pick yourself up.Beautiful!You mentioned very good things!Support is very important,acceptance of one's mistakesis very important.I would love for you to tell usa few things that you realized,the shortcomings you realizedafter your first attempt,and then you worked hard on them,what were a few things that you realizedthat you missed out on?I was lacking in 2 sides,one side was the mental preparation,and the other in actual preparation.In the mental preparation,there was a lack of confidence on my part,there was a lot of unnecessary guiltthat was there in my mind.Every day I would go to bed thinkingI haven't given my  full effort,and I might not be able to do it,the negative talk that we do to ourselves,that everyone else is doing much more,so that's why I say that guiltis also necessary,it's a necessary evil,but when it exceeds that limit,then it sapping your productivity.So I think that's what happened with methat I was too harsh with myself,number one.And number 2 was that I had still notabsorbed the no-excuse policy.So mentally the thing that if anythinggoes even slightly wrong,or if I am not feeling well,then I would give in to it,that I could not study becauseI'm not feeling well,so in the second examI realized that this would not work,because UPSC doesn't knowhow you were feeling,and they would not change the patternof the exam according to that.So in the second attempt,I made sure not to use these small thingsas an excuse.If I was not feeling well in the morning,I would give more effort in the evening,or if I am not able to studyin the evening then I should wake upeven earlier in the morning.So the effort to make every daythe best in my second attemptwas probably lacking in my first attempt,and it was more result oriented.And the mistakesin my actual preparation were,first was regarding the mock examinations.I was very late in giving my mock papers,and a big blunder that I did wasthat I took my mocks very lightly.The timings for actual examswere 9:30 to 11:30 in the morning,so I didn't pay a lot of attention to it,and I used to give mock papersin the evening, or in breaks of an hour,so these things seem small,but create a big difference,because unless and until you sitfor those two hours,attempt the exam in the same wayas you have to givethe actual examination,you will never to be able to grip it.So in the actual examination,I had no idea about time management,I attempted less number of questionsbecause I did not knowwhat is my optimal guess number,I had never analyzed the mocks,I just attempted them, got the marks,and satisfied with what I got,I never analyzedhow wrong is my guesswork,I never knew in which area wasmy guess working or not,what is my optimal attempt numberto get maximum marks.So I analyzed all these thingsthe next time.I gave a lot of mocksbut in the actual time period.And another thing I did was thatI gave those mocks in the actual school,because I did not want to take any risks,so I knew when I will feel hoton the school bench,and when the invigilator take rounds,so I told my brother and my fatherto pinch me like an invigilatorasking to sign the sheets,so that there is no scope of me havingany trouble in the actual examination.So this was one thing.And besides that,I missed newspapers.As I said I read newspapers for 4 years,and after that,I don't know why I felt thatI need to save time,so I went to the daily news analysis,so I think missing that alsocost me a lot.For the second attempt,I did not even miss one day of newspaper,and I particularly asked my fatherto mark the newspaper for me daily,and then I used to read the newspaperend to end the next day,and I knew that the daily news analysiswill at least not cover it,it can only supplement it.So these were the few changes thatI made in my journey.These are incredible!And you know the joy on my face is,as you said, these things seem very small,but together they give such a big result.You are such a great example,not clearing it and missing itwith 26 marks to all India rank 3,this is not a trivial jump,it is an unbelievable jump,and of course, you made that happen.I now want to talk aboutthe interview prep,because it is a very different experience,and I have never experienced it,so I often see UPSC channel Reelson Instagram where they are mocking it,and I wonder if it's like thatand at that level.So can you explain how your interview wasand how did you prepare for that?As I said, each stage of this exam hasa different demand.So prelims, mains, and an interview.Sometimes people take the interviewvery lightly,or we think we'll get through,but its demand is very very different iswhat I realized.One is they're not checking your knowledgeand when I say that it is not mean thatyou should not have any knowledgebut it's not sufficient.So many times people think that evenif they don't have knowledgeor they don't revise, it will be fine.So when they say that the knowledgeis not being tested,it means that they take it for grantedthat you are knowledgeable enoughthat you've reached here.So that's the basic,but that will not suffice.I think what matters the most isthat they check your confidence,they check your honesty,and you cannot befool the panelistwhich has been in the servicefor so many years,and if you think thatyou can get away with it,I think it's very foolish on our part.So this is one thing I realized thatit is very important to be honestin the interview.If you say no even 9-10 times rather thangiving a false yes and then givinga false answer,that's more beneficial to you,and can be very detrimental for you.So my interview experiencewith the board was very nice.They checked me on multiple angleswhich was also very nice,because you also tend to enjoywhen you are asked multiple things.I wrote in my detailed application form,I like doing Model United Nationsso they straight away went to UN,they straight away went to WTO,like what is the functional of WTO?How are the relations with India?So that's how they molded itand we went into international affairs.After that, we also touched on economics,and they asked me a coupleof questions regardingwhat opinion do you have aboutthe economy of the country currently,and why do you think the startups werebooming a little bit earlierin the startup space,and in India specifically,we have a lot of unicorns coming,but then somehow, they still say thatit's a bubble?So these were the questionsthat we discussed.Then we moved to the environmental partabout the declining bird population,so the environmental angle was touched.Then we moved to the cultural part,because I was born in Bhatinda,so they wanted to know a little bitabout the cultural history of Bhatinda,so we discussed that.And one question thatI typically remember was thatsince my parents were doctors,so they also went to Covid,and they asked me what wasone fallout of the Covid vaccinationthat we are giving so much effortto increase the reach of Covid vaccines,so what is the fallout of that?So I felt that was a tricky question,because until now we've only heardto make Covid vaccination reachas many people as possible.So these were the questionsthat were asked to me.So one really needs to be preparedfor this, and it requiresa lot of thinking on your feet,like you will have to improvise instantly,and you still have to maintainyour confidence,and as you said, you have to be honest,don't answer if you don't know.Was there any question where you said,I don't have any opinion.Sir, I think it's better not tosay no in opinionated questionsbecause you will have an opinion,it's on the technical side thatyou can say a no.So luckily, I wasn't askedany such question aboutwhich I was totally blank,or I did not know the answerbecause it was not technical.For opinionated,I feel since you read newspapers,and you cannot be indecisive about things,you have to give your opinionon either side,and you have to justify it,so I think I did not say it that time.But I was a little blankin the question about Covid,but somehow I think I managed it,I don't know how it was managed,but I answered it to the bestof my ability at that time.Brilliant!Now let's come to the day of the result.What were you expecting?Sir, frankly speaking, all I wanted wasfor the result to be declared,because those two days were so heavy,we were waiting since Friday.On Friday, I was very nervous and excited,but the result didn't come out.On Saturday, the nervousness increasedand excitement decreased.And by Sunday, I was very very irritatedthat the result was not being declared.Just declare it!Yes!So on Monday, I was totally blank waitingfor the result, and to see what happens.But obviously, I had not expected sucha good rank,nobody does in an exam like UPSC,but I think by God's graceand blessings of my well-wishers,I could get this rank.Brilliant!I am so happy for you!Final question, Gamini.Now when you are in your training,and you are meeting every personwho has cracked this exam,do you find similar patternsthat they also adopted similar strategiesto crack this examination,or you saw something interesting,where somebody's approachor perspective was differentor a different way of thinking about it,because the reason I ask this question is,often we feel that onlythe method of the topper is rightand that may not be true,so since you are interactingwith so many people on a daily basis,every one of them has worked hardto crack this exam,what new have you learned about preparingfor this exam.Absolutely right, sir.I think there are basic similaritiesbut a lot of differences in the waywe approach the preparations.So I get so amazed that peoplefrom all across the country,from different backgrounds,some are doctors, some are engineers,some have even done their MBAs,some could not clear itin their first attempt,and for some, it was their last attempt,so it's very thrilling to just knowthat the diversity in this examinationis no one path to clear it.So if I have to discuss the similarities.In the first part of my book relatedto mental preparation,I think everybody faced those issues,be it loneliness,be it comparison with your peers,be it having the fear of failing,be it risk-taking,so these are a few things that broadlyall of us have faced,and when we sit together,we discuss how difficult that journeywas at that time.But as I have also mentionedin a chapter called,where does uniqueness fit?I think it is inspired from that,if I take my own example,I was the kind of personwho was more into self-study,who preferred sitting at homeand studying,but there are so many of uswho cleared it through libraries.So they used to go to the libraryin the morning,they were associated on Telegram channels,they did group discussions,and they got their answers evaluatedby each other.I am a totally opposite person whereI wanted to prepare by myself,I did not feel very comfortablein group study.So this is a big difference,but still, it shows you thatthere is not any one path to crackthis examination,so I believe that it's very importantto maintain your individuality.If you like waking up in the morning,there was some other peoplewho liked studying during the night,and some liked to studyearly in the morning.That's why I think it's not the place,it's not the time that matters,it's just what you have to doand how you do it.So things that you have to doare there with you,but the way you do it depends on you.Beautiful! I so love this!And I think this is the best endto this conversation,where whatever you do in your life,whether it's an exam,whether it's a professional career,or even a relationship,until you know yourself,you will not be able to designthe best for yourself.And the more you live your lifeaccording to other people,the more you might fail,and the day you introspectand create a strategy for yourself,it will work for youbecause it is uniquely you.Thank you so much, Gamini!Thanks on multiple levels!Number 1, for this conversation.It was nice to hear your candid thoughts,and your honest and direct opinion.Second, for writing this book.It wasn't easy!Your exam result was declared,I remember, then you said thatI want to write this,so you also had to write before training.So, all those who are preparingfor the UPSC exam, please check out,How I topped The UPSC and How You Can Too,by Gamini Singla,who has All India rank 3and is in her training right now.I have tagged its linkin the pinned comment and description,so please you can buy this bookby clicking that link.It is a very thin book,but a very powerful book.This book has years ofhard work and wisdom,that I love that.And third, for your dedication.I love that people like youwill join Indian Administrative Services,and will take this country forward.It is so heartwarming to see thatpeople like you will givethe establishment of this countrya strong support and create a foundation,that I am just excited aboutwhat lies ahead for our countrythrough all of you young and bright minds.Thank you so much!All the best for your training!Get your first position victoriously!When do you get your first role,first position?So sir, after phase 1, we will goto our district training wherewe will get some charges,but our first independent chargeas an SDM will be after another one year,after the district training,and after phase 2,where we will be posted as SDM.Wow!Thank you so much sir, for inviting me!It was my pleasureto have this conversation,I think I really enjoyedthis conversation,and thank you so much,you have been inspiring millionsof aspirants like usand youngsters throughout.So thank you so much!Thank you so much!Thank you so much, Gamini!All the best!Have a lovely day,and thank you for doing this!Thank you, sir!
