Okay, so sorry.Yes, so we were discussingyou were telling aboutabout your relationship with FD,and how you play safe.You like things to be organized.So, this-- Do you spend on yourself?Yes sir, I absolutely do.On what do you spend the most?I, either tech, means gadget,and even in gadgets,what happens mostly is,yes, I am a little fond of it.And the other,the car costs me a little,means from petrol to its maintenanceand this, I have watched your videosbut I do what I feel like.I, you know what?the best thing, Himanshi that you said,you were talking of psychology of money.You're right.The whole essence of that bookis to do what is best for you.So, you don't have to followthat if someone says,then have to do that,should be done here, done therewhat I love about what you said is,that I am like this,I get the most comfort in this.I get the most happiness in this,so I will do it like that.And that will work for you.You will always be happy because of that.So, thatâs great.Donât try to change that.Thank you so much, Sir.Yes, this stays with me, Sir.Yes, I was talking about the same thingthat I read in that book too,so, the same point came out of itthat bro in which you can sleep peacefullyand this thing is since childhood,means the family where I come from,meaning in my case specially,so that has stayed,pal, don't want any tension.So, it is said that,there is a saying,borrowing is like a death wish.Shouldnât have a loan at all.And secondly, stuff like this,spend according to what you have,This has been with me,even during college time,I never asked anyone for a loan, nothingI was that kind of a kid.generally we are like that.we are many times,it is okay buddy,I had a friendwhose scene was very different.Spend this much and then see,four people coming from hereand there asking for it in the end.So, was not fond of that.Even now it's the same thing in mindthat shouldnât owe a penny to anyone.Nothing of that sort should exist.I'll do it, no problem.That's what I was saying,even when I lend, I forgetabout getting it back, will see.And donât want the tension of EMI too.In that case, whether in case of the car,initially when I purchased a property,that time I had to take a loan.And after two months, I was telling them,do one thing, letâs finish this.They said no, it takes at least 6 months.Fine, no issues, so that is there.So, when you go with friendsto dinner, etc.or go out to travel,Yes.So, do you particularly say,we'll split the billEveryone will pay their own expenses,or you pick up the bill,how does it happen?Yes, I'm one to pick the bill.Means if I have money,and until,there's a little bit of this with me, Sir,the things mean,the way you are,similar things keep coming in lifeeverywhere, somehow.So, the thing with me is,if I understand a person's intentionMeans, I feel he is greedy,then I'm a little on the back foot,because buddy now it's too much,means I don't want to be a fool,but from my end,I don't have a problem either.Means, the bill,mostly this has happened now,since I have started earning,all the friends that I have,they were studying until now,so in that case, wherever we go,now what happens is,whether consider it patriarchy,or God knows what to call it?Whether I am the hostor whenever I order anything,everywhere, in a way,everywhere is the same story,theyâll bring the bill,if there is a guy with me,he will get that bill,so in the end,weâre look at each otherâs face and laugh.So, that scene is always there.But ultimately, I pay.Mostly, itâs like that.Otherwise, the effort is there,in this thing,itâs about me, Sir that I want,Iâll do it, there is no issue,in my mind, I get the calculation,assume, if I am with someone,have met thrice and the person has paid,Iâve said, now I want to do, itâs done.So, that is there,split, as such, is not of that kind,that we used to do during college time,a little bit.It was not there at that time .Thatâs it, thatâs it. Thatâs it, exactly.Awesome, and, and, andtell me about your growing up years,so how was your upbringing as a childand experiences?So, in my childhood,my parents were teachers,are government teachers,father is no longer there now,but mother is,and I was with my mamaji,in the beginning,until the age of almost 13 or 14in a village of Bulandshahr,and Bulandshahr is in UP.So, I was there.With respect to money, it was not like,had a lot of money, plenty of money,or anything like that,and my mamaji was also a teacher,so the salary is not that high.but I was the only child, and in that way,and in no way with regards to studiesor necessities, ever feltthat there is no moneyor that kind of a situation,but it wasn't being blown eitherThat is, even passion for clothestill date personally never existed for me.that I should goand shop a lot for myself.Now many of my friends say,so I've started gradually.Otherwise, if I have a T-shirt,I can wear that for any number of timesand even, you may find this thing odd,Iâve not shared it anywhere,my this, in our families,means middle class or lower-middle classfamilies this happens,My sister used to live here in Delhi,so, whenever mummy used to gofrom here to the village,she used to take a bag full of clothes,the clothes that didnât fit,that is what we do.So, she used to wear those clothes nicely.There was no problem.I even drove his old cycleand there was nothing like that.Meaning it never came to mindthat oh God, we are very pooror in a very pathetic condition.But also,it wasn't that we were blowing money.Meaning, forget about blowing that way,finding happiness within limited meanswas all about it.And with studies, yes the familyused to try to educate in a good schoolor whatever the expenses were,I've been very fond of pen since a child,I used to buy expensive pens.Meaning, the one which I could buyas per that time.And were you always studious,were you interested in studies?Sir, studious, you can saythat I had not been very meritorious.I've been in the first few years.After that it did not happen like,my focus with marksafter a time became such that,I used to enjoy studying.Curiosity was very high.and if the teacher,my interest stayed intact in subjectsin which I kept getting good teachers.There wasn't much tuition in the village.So in that it used to be,where my teachers were goodI was very interested in that andused to get good marks in that.The teachers who couldn't create interestor my interest could not becreated with them,in that case, I could neverstudy for marks in my life.That was very difficult for me.So, exam fear toohas been a thing that has been in my life,while I had good preparation,when I was in 12th,preparation was good, itâs about math,And even my examwas left incomplete in math,in which I had worked very hard.My tuition teacher also said,even in school, the teacher said, Himanshiyou will do well, this and that.But it has been with me,if interest or curiosity comes in,make to study any number of hoursthere is no tension,but I couldnât remainthe marks-oriented child, maybe.So average, above average.Wonderful and at which point did you knowthat you are fond of teachingor are you good at teaching?Sir, it was always there, maybe.somewhere subconsciouslylike you teach the children around you,there are cousins in the smallerclasses than you or anyone.And an incident of minefrom the very beginning,I used to go to my mamaji's school.He was a teacher in a government schoolso, I was in his school for 2 years.The incident is from the 4th, I think.so, 4th or 3rd, must have been like that,once I went to his school just to visitit was during that time.And at that time,I just started teaching children,which was a smaller class than me,I started teaching them,no one had told me, but just like that.So, interest in teachingwas probably always there.Because had seen only that around.I saw my mamaji very closely.He has worked so hard with the children,he is a teacher in a government school,it is generally seen, in UP, etc.,it happens many times, donât work hard,but Iâve seen him in a different light.I've also been in his school for 2 years.So, I have seen very closelyhow hard he used to workand there were many other things to managein the village, if a child is not comingor family is not sending.You will go to take him.Will explain them.Something else is happening.Someone leaves a buffalotied in the school.So, I've seen many things.They have been very inspirational to me.Means teaching,is something which is veryclose to my heart,so over the period of time,it was in my mindthat I would do anything,one time I wanted to become a cricketer,then wanted to become an RJ.Then in the interim there wasa slight fondness for engineering too.and these kept changing,but It was in mind, whatever I do,teaching will definitely be there.whether I teach it in the form of tuition,or do anything but want to teach.And that has remained the constant,I have always been teaching somewhere.Lovely and, and which...one is teaching is an art.Second, do you thinkif a teacher is good,he can teach anything,or the teacher and what they teachcombine to actually become powerful?Sir, both, the first thing,if you are a really good teacherand I will not say just anything,but you need that certain interest.And if you're a really good teacher,you'll teach much better than the averageif you are really curious,really mean good for your learners,or really wish to share that thing.So that is very important,if you have an interest in that subjector you can create it,then you will be able to teachif you are a good teacher.Then that is a skill.So, that is the thing.How did you go towards online?Sir, in 2016my teaching training completed.And I was 19 years old at that time.And at that timewhen my teaching training completed,so in our teaching training itselfthere is a TET exam,it is called Teacher Eligibility Test,used to give that,when we were appearing.So, I was done with it.Then in 2016,in September the exam was held.I feel, I made the channel in October,completed 6 years now on 4th October,just a day before.And at that time I felt,can I share on this platformcalled YouTube.can I upload by myself?We used to watch it for teaching,learning material.Videos used to come from outside,of foreign countries,they are making something bybreaking and joining, DIY type.So one day I had a question in my mind,can I do it?Then I saw that yes, I can do.Then it came to my mind, what can I do?So, the first thing that came to mindwas that I had given CTET,I can say that there can be three ways.So, then there was a map lying in my houseand I was fond of quotes, etc.I had taken out some prints of the quotes.I pasted them back on a wall,it would look nice, watch a little,by taking the phone this way in my handrecorded it with the front camera,the two and a half minutes videoand it started from there then.Then the next day, I found out,there's something called monetization too.So, then this way things kept happening,but the exam for which I shared for,that exam did not happen for 2 yearsand at that timepeople anyway did not study online,for that exam, there were no people,I think it must have beenamong the initial channels,Letâs Learn.Wonderful, wonderful.You or course then,like whenever I read about youand of course I have seen your videos.What I love is,often your introductionis that you are a teacherand also create content on YouTube.So, it's almost like that YouTubeis an additional identity of yours,but your core identity is teacher,Right.would you agree with that?I would agree,I'll agree, because teacher,even before that if say something,then a learner.meaning I, my main thing,the thing I was interested inwas that I learn.And without sharing that thingyou will not stopmeans it flows in your vein like this,so it's absolutely in the blood somewhere.So learning, sharing, discussingI have seen these things since childhood.My mamaji has had a good influence on me,I would say.Today when I think like this,you are able to connect those dots.So people are coming from the villageto consult him,master ji, get this done, do this,or anything like that.He used to go to school with his teachers,who were his colleagues.We used to go together.They are talking about a lot of thingsand things are emanating from thereSomeone is reciting Kabir's couplets,something is happening,so that in itself, it means,something that I could not live,it has come in my nature,to preach somewhereor to talk those things.Means discussion.My favorite thing is that,people with whomI cannot have long discussions or talk,questions or that curiosity,a lot of petty, small talks,I do not get interested in it.My time is getting wasted.Have you chosen your friendsalso like this?Or your friends have now understood youand they have got molded?Friends no, will not say molded,all of us, yes, a little bit of influencethey have on me, mine is on them,and kind of, you can say.But even while having fun,it is not that I am no longer the kid,means not having fun,absolutely serious things every time,this and that,If you may have seen mine vlogs also now,there's no shortage of fun.we have had a lot of fun,now I can't speak here.But yes, we used to go to movies, etc.during our college timeafter taking permission from the teachers.What's is the biggest illegal thingcommitted by you, Himanshi?Illegal? Sir, on the Internet?Which you can say publicly.When I was young, so without--I didn't have a driving license,so we...That everyone has done.People do that.But I've done a little more,but I can't tell beyond that.You used to drive a bike or scooter, car?Everything, since childhood,cycle, bike, scooter, careverything is done right now.But I drove bike a lot.Fine.Bike. I want one more,means want to buy a bike too.Want to do some proper toursI enjoy on a bike.Very nice.Are you interested in road travel?Of course, sir. Of course.I even enjoy driving nowbecause one is our weather conditions,then it is more fun to drive in the heat.And itâs with me, Sir,if I'm unable to get out,when there used to be a lot of work,I was also with 2-3 platforms.There used to be manylive sessions on my YouTube channel too.So that much,even between those classes,I used to take out time,1 hour or 45 minutes in the evening,that there is a place 5 km from my house,so want to go there with the Scottyand every minute is calculated.And many times I used to take the laptop,even to see anything minute about the PDF,or do something.Will have tea at the stall and come.means that, that was mine, at evening,I have to see the evening,this is with me.So, now that eveninghas slightly turned into night,But I want thatI come out of my day,I see the outside world,an hour or whatever, it is with me.Thatâs beautiful.How is your routine usually?How is your routine?Sir, now it moves like,I stay awake at night,it can be a bad habit for many peoplebut I have this that I'll sleep till 4:00,in the morning at 4:00, at 5:00and then sometimes I get up at 11:00.It even becomes 12 at times.Means the same, 6-7 hours.And after that,whatever is the day routine.I have classes in the evening,before that if there is to be a vlog edit,working on some book,a book is about to arriveor some exam is coming upso according to thatsome PDF is getting ready.All these things go on.And for different daysthere are different thingsthen there are classes in the evening.Then in the evening now,since some time I've continuedthe gym for some time.So, one-hour gym.and after that stroll for an hour,So, I become free by 12:00 at night,then the next day.That's wonderful and how big is your teamthat supports you completely?Sir, I have a companyso I'm a shareholder there.So most of the things get delegated,work is done from there,work is doneand in my personal teammost people work remotely.There are a couple of peoplewho come daily now.Otherwise, it works out,I personally believe,there would be 5-6 people.That would be all.Tell me one thing, Himanshiand I have observed this.Most teachers who take live online classesthey speak very rapidly.Why is that so?Iâll tell you.if this is the case with most,then one of the reasons can be, Sir,in online,you see bit of expressions in offline,like I just took offlineclasses in February,then there you can see the expressionsand you know that right nowshe is sitting comfortably.She has to take the entire classwhoever has to go, can go, yes.But in online it happens that,more things in less time,the more you can give, the better.There will be less wastageof the personâs timeand secondly,you are unable to look into his eyes,then you will have to exactlymaintain that interest.So, I think maybe that's one reason.Secondly, personally in my case is thatmy mummyâs pitch is a bit faster,so it is even probably hereditaryto some extent.So, it can be that as well.Wonderful.And do you change the way you teachwhen you are offline?Yes, youâre little bit more chilled outAnd proper doubts are raised.It doesn't fee--it comes.Youâre relaxedin offline, there is little easeand itâs more fun too.But online too has its own fun.People are watching from differentcorners of the countryand even in that we do not stop,the teachers that are good, they will--jokes, etc., all that happens in between.Everything is seen,all those things reach Tanmay's channel.It is necessary toobecause it should not be boring either.Exactly...And right now I have a colleague with me,so he has also told me,you are taking your 1-hour classso seriously,you are not smiling in the whole class,what has happened?I also noticed,yes, I'm getting serious in life.So, I wreaked havoc in yesterdayâs class.There was a joke every second minute.Awesome, when you startedyour personal YouTube channel,so was there a hesitationthat students will now see their teacherin a different light.Don't know how would they think?What will they do do?Or it was like a very normal expansion.Sir, until then,it was that stage,those were the initial years,okay, I too shall prepare for a joband have to do some things together.This was like, coming online,recall, I forgot the question.Will you repeat it again?Yes, yes.the personal YouTube channel you started,and I think did in 2019,if I am not wrong.2016. 2016.No that was your teaching channel,your personal, Himanshi Singh's channelwhere you vlog.Yes, yes.Right?Right.So, when you started that channel,were you ever hesitantthat the students will nowsee the teacher's private life.I don't know how will they feel?Will it be a disconnect, etc?Or was it like a normal progression,I'm already doing this, letâs do this too.You have asked me such a nice questionThat it gives me a chancefor catharsis through it.So, I started that in November 2019.The purpose of that was,some of my thoughts,like I like to speak on different topics,so I will do that there.I had also posted 2, 3, 4 videos,then in February 2020,my father passed away,so that motivation of mine for myself,meaning I entered a different zone.At that time that thing couldn't continue.I couldn't focus on that channel that muchand it did not remain a priorityin that wayand then after that,last year, then we started about vlogs.You can say, there was a lot of hesitationbecause vlogging, I do not thinkeven now I have probably not seenany teacher, the vlog that we do.So in that way,it is very difficult to come openlyat timesAnd, this has stayed,even now sometimes receive commentstell, now even teachers are vloggingSo, that has stayed a bit.and at times even I feel,it happens that you become protectiveabout your personal life,why should I share?So, it has happened many times,I recorded a number of vlogswhich I did not put,did not get uploadedand no, now I have started to realizeI am not just a teacher, I am also a humanI can have other aspects too,and if I am online,there is also an aspect,if someone likes, who feels like,will watch, there is no coercion,and that is another shade of mine.Itâs another side of minethat you can see on that channel.But you still feel a little restrictedat times, that people expectfrom you a little civility at best.it is not that we are uncivilizedbut sometimes you have to think onceeven before joking,a person remains conscious a bit,and this has been there, Sir,how you show your private life.Then I think that, those people who,like I uploaded a vlogand those who really like it,and most people are like that,so in that case it is good for them.They are enjoying seeing meor they are feeling much betteror on a given day I am doing somethingthat inspires someoneand you are able to showthat teacher is not just a personwho is very seriousin front of whom you cannot say anything.I never wanted to be such a teacher.But youâre able to connectby going to the human level.and in a small wayit has happened with me too.Assume, there is a Connaught Place,I have gone so many times during collegethat there is no limit.Right now, I will feel bored, if I thinkof going many times. But for somethinglike if I have to go there for a vlog,so that I feel,Iâll be able to show it differentlyto people.They are watching through my eyes.As it happens,there is a manager in a bank,so I was just talking with him,so one day,I had also been to his house,so met his children and all.So, I was saying,we were having a casual talkso he said Himanshi, first, I said Sir,there is no boredom with anything.he said, Himanshi,earlier they lived life for themselves,lived per their views,now live per their childrenâs view.I found that thing to be very interesting.It is similar in a waythat previously I experienced myself,and now for showing it,or when I record and show it,a new energy is infused.I am able to show that through my lens,the same thing, So, I have fun.Very beautiful, very beautiful,I really like it.When I saw, Let's Learn,which is your main channel,and I was like she is very serious,an extremely dedicated teacher,a different rhythm.And that's like absolutely cut to cut.Everything has to be read properly.No mischief to be done anywhere,all this and then I saw the vlog thing,this is different,and I could actually relate to it.Because suddenlyyou had become completewhich you wonderfully put as well.Youâre not just a teacher,thatâs not your only role.You playing many more roles,why wouldn't you want to do that?Because of that,the children will also feel,this is a relatable entity.She is not just my teacher or educator.Like she is somebodywho is a living person,I can maybe even be friends with herand still learn proper,and that is just so wonderful,wonderful, awesome.One more thing has happened in this, Sir.It has happened with me,the learners that I have,They have been elder than me in age.My average age group is 25 to 34and I just turned 25.In that case it has been,and this had been from the startwhen I had started from 19-20, since then, because there are teachers with mewho after the teacher trainingprepare for competitive exams for teachingor are preparing for TET,So, in that casefirst of all they are not kids,so I don't treat them like kids anyway.I have like, we are on an even keel.We are all learners and are learning.So in that thing it feels more better.I don't want to bethat authoritative teacher.Fine, we can all learn,that effort continues.But at times you have to be seriousbecause many people thendo not take it seriouslyor take it lightly,so that one,balancing them bothis a challenge most of times.Absolutely, absolutely.Do you live life in a planned way,like you live by planningor it's free flowing,Will see, when it happens.Sir, a little planning,yes, you can say so,I want that planning.I feel there are lots of plans.Yes, can say, can say.Iâm open to things that happen,for that also, but randomness as well.But I do try to plan,if anything random happens later will see.There is also a little stress due to thisat times.So, there is a bit of planning, yes.So, what's your next plan now?Immediately a thing,reach the destination or want to achieve.There is nothing like that, Sir,in life now.Maybe I'm saying this at a very young age,so you may even laugh at it,but I am at that stage of life right now,mentally at least,I feel, I work becauseby that I am able to give an impactor contribution in the society.And monetarily,things have developed on their own.Since day onethat's never been my intention.I was so youngthat maybe even my housemateswould not have been expecting meto do something for them.and so it is always been for me thatin a way this is a consequence,it's bound to come on its ownor will be seen,will work any which way.So that is one thing, I am in a state now,where I have retired, kind of,nor there is any liability on menor do I want to keepthat kind of a liabilitythat would disturb my sleep.Things are fine in every way,So, I am working becauseI really like that thing.I love teachingand at times you can also take a breakwhen you feel that bro, itâs been too muchand whatever things I am doing,through vlogsanother side of mine comes out,or I am editingor able to see that story creation.There are some skills developing in me,because of which I am doing thingsand there's contribution through teaching,there is no particular reasonor any such purpose in lifeby achieving which I am now,yes, itâs final now.I feel I'm happy enough in lifeand there's satisfaction as well.I'll still tell you the rest,if you're a human, desires are never end.I have some interest in psychology,so anytime I get a chance in life,I am not that free right now.Will either go abroadand do something with psychologyor if possible, in India,I want to study psychology properly.I think you'll be very good at that.And now you please try.If you get a chance, please.A lot-- With that studyyou'll be able to teach many more peoplethat there will be no limit.So, as much as you can,do that for yourself and for the worldand I really hope you do it.One of my question, Himanshi, is,how oftenor has it happened anytimethat you see yourself in the mirroror see through someone else's eyes,then youâre like,I've gone too far in life.Like you can't even imaginehow far you have come alongand you don't even recognizethat 19-year-old Himanshiwho started that YouTube channelto just share what you had learned.How often does it happen?Or when has that last happened?Sir, this happens at times,I don't know how you come to knowsuch matters of the heartbecause, I have not heard these questionsanywhere else.So, it happens at times.Now, last time,I was talking to my friend, I think,must have been a few days ago.So, I was saying,there was something of hers,Right now, we are at a stagewhere we are either looking for partnersor else some people are already involvedor that kind of thing,or next someone is getting married.So we were talking,I told her something of this sortso, I had that, why are you tensed?you mind yourselfand until you don't find that person,whatâs the hurry? What happened?She told me something,she came along with financial aspectsor God knows, on settlement, yes,your are at a different stage of life.Iâve just joined a job, in that way.And so probably,Many times the other personlooks at you that waywhere even then, I am normal.Just that I have that confidence in memaybe don't knowIf I did a little hard workor maybe even previouslyI may have been like that in lifeto some extent.So, that thing gets reflected there.You feel, possibly that is whythe other person is not feeling secure,while doing somethingand this happens many timesI am unable to recall many examples,but this happens at times.You have gone to the villageand any, anything--some relative will give you that vibemany times, it can also be some learner.at times it also feels goodand at times, I feelthese are the boundations of our mind,you've yourself thoughtthat you have reached therehad you been in my place,don't know what you would have done?You can still do it,even you have an equal right to liveso, it is not like thatMany times boundaries are in our minds.By of this thing,this thing clicks very oftenthere is nothing as suchthat only after reaching somewhereyou can take a decisionAbsolutely, absolutely, absolutely.what do you feel is your biggest drawback?Me, a flaw?With me, one is, I am unable to fake.this is little problem with me,you can say.I cannot fake.It's very difficult for me.It will either show up on my faceor else, means, it is very difficult.Because that is not in my nature.like lying or manipulating,All those things are beyond me.So many times,that too is important in this worldat timesso, there I can say, yes,when I am unable to fake,it becomes a little difficultand the other,I am a little emotional.Which is not a bad thing.There should be humanity in a human beingbut sometimes it exceeds.Do you cry after watching movies?Yes, last time, I had seen a movie, Major,was based on a soldier,was a soldier in the army,was made on Sandeep Unnikrishnan,so I cried a lot after seeing that.Other than that I thinkI have also seen Gangubai.Don't know if we can take the name or not.Seeing that too I had become upset,by seeing that.It was a very good movieAnd even after seeing Lal Singh Chaddha,I have cried, think,people can also make fun of me for this.Because many people may not have liked it,but in the end when he says,I do not know if you have seen it or not,Yes.so he says is it free willor things are happening in life,is it destiny, what is it?So, I liked that movie very much.So, in movies, yes. It happens with me.Even book, I was reading thatFridays, Tuesdays with Morrie.I am saying FridaysSo yes, it came to me many years ago.I randomly clicked some video of yours,in that you were telling about many books.I said this is lying with me,let's read it.So I read that,In it, it was there thatrelations don't cease with death.Like that, something like that.and I lost my father in 2020.So, I read that and cried.In that I introspected a few things.So, this happens with me.At times I don't cry where Iâve to cry.Because I feelnow is the situation to take control.Now it's a do-or-die thing,so I probably may not cry at that timebut that way I'm very emotional.Any movie character,you feel is the closest to your life?I never thought this way.Think, think if there is any.Are you your own favorite?I'm a favorite, but I'm not that,not that.Means, in that case.You are not the Geet of Jab We Met.No, no, no at all.No, I wasn't even thinking.No, there is no such character,actually I see movieseither for entertainmentor if I can learn somethingbecause my nature is like that.If I get something from somewhere,I will see that,if there is any philosophy of lifeor somethingI will connect or understand that thing.Otherwise it doesnât happen that I idolizeor Iâm not the kind of a movie fanwho would raise a flag.Great. Do you listen to songs?Yes. Good enough.Were you a student who while studyingused to listen to songs?Yes, while doing math.You know everything.No, don't know why is that?And so many math,especially while doing math,while doing math people just songs,I used to listen too.I am doing integration,and it's playing near melistening to songs.It used to be like onlyby listening to the song,we used to know, what needs to be done.It was like a distant memory trip.You also used to do like that?Yes, even I used to do,I too used to do. I loved it.Great, to wind up, Himanshi,three questions, rapid fire.Number 1.Pick between speed and perfection.Perfection.Because you can only say in one word.Because, otherwisemany times speed is also needed.But still, Iâll choose perfection.Okay. Pick between money and power.Both are such thingsthat I never focused on in life.Money. Because power corrupts people.I'm kidding.No, very true, very true,absolutely, absolutely.Okay, because you are only 25,maybe this questionwill not be right for you,but still Iâll ask,you will have two choices, Himanshi.Choice 1.I'll give you Rs. 50 Cr.Hmm hm.Or choice number 2.I'll make you 15 years oldbut you will know everythingthat you know today.Meaning more headache.[both laughing]I found out thatyou don't want to take tension in life.This is very clear.Because I remember that college time,thereâs Rs. 50 in the pocket,but the mind is so light,means next level.It is  there even now.Even now, I'm a personof little fun and enjoyment.But still, I think about things.I like perspectives a lotand it can't bethat I see something and leave it,then I have to think on it,try to understand.So, we were talking about50 Cr. versus 15 years.15 years knowing what you know today.Means, of course, 15 years.Yes, clearly?Yes 50 Cr.Itâs okay isn't it, that will happen.Will happen,this will come in 1 year.[both laughing]Awesome. Brilliant.Thank you so much, Himanshi,very, very, very nice to talk to you.Your free-flowing natureand your honest nature that you showed,you call it your drawbackbut I think itâs your biggest strength.That you are who you areand you are as you are.So, no person will have to second guesswho you are? What you are?Whether telling the truth or not.And that is just a wonderful wayto live life.Sir, I will praise myself again here.Meaning, I want this.if I said so, then it must be true,no one to doubt her,that kind of a personIt is beautifuland I hope that you continueto inspire millions of studentsthat you continue to do todayand you serve as an inspirationfor so many people.So, thank you so muchfor doing what you are doing.Thank you, Sir,and I have also seen your videos,to become little financially aware,and I very--You even speak very well on life .I have even seen your those videoswhere you are talking about your failuresor talking about life,there is a lot to learn in thatespecially the new generation,I'm very, you can say,opposed to this thingor I do not preach this thing much,because in the quest of hustleleave everything,or so much for money,you are hustling becauseonly money will come, that is your goal.An expensive car, an expensive house,or something of this sort, lifestyle.That canât be the purpose.That can't be the objective.You explain that beautifully at times.It could be the consequence.Now many people will make fun of this too,Yes, you yourself bought a carand telling us what is there in the car?but you do it differently,according to your own,the things, at the stage you happen to be.You didn't run after it,it happened to you.Exactly, exactly, absolutely.That is true. Brilliant.God bless you. Thank you so much.All the best, Himanshi.Thank you.
