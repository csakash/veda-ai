Letâs go.How to decide a health insurance plans foryour parents and why should they bedifferent from the family floater plan?Weâll get to know in this video.Friends, you are welcome to the second episode ofThe complete guide toâ¦.Friends, you all are welcome to the second episode ofThe Complete Guide To Buying InsuranceNo it is the thirdFriends, you all are welcome in the next edition ofThe Complete Guide ToFriends, you all are welcome in the next edition ofThe Complete Guide To Buying Insurancein association with policybazaar.com as myknowledge partner. I will cover all the minutedetails of insurance in this series, and todayâsepisode is dedicated to health insurance,and that too specifically for our parents.When it comes to parents' health insurance,then the approach we adopt to select the rightinsurance plan, to make sure it has all those thingswhich are required for our parents, they are verydifferent from when we are deciding on aninsurance plan for our family or our own selves.I will share 4 things with you in this episode.First, why should parentsâ health insurancebe different from familyâs health insurance?Number 2, why are family floater planand individual plan different?NoI will share 4 specific things with you in this episode.Number 1, why should the health insurancethat we choose for our parents be differentfrom familyâs health insurance?Second, when we choose health insurance forour parents, then what are the thingsyou must look out for so thatthe plan is useful for your parents?3rd, what is the difference between corporate planand individual plan and which are thingsthat are important to know?And fourth, how to buy it?Letâs start.Firstly, health insurance for our parents.It is obvious that our parents are aging,their illnesses are increasing, they have reachedan age where the risk of attractingillnesses or falling ill, is higher, that is whytheir health insurance plan should bevery different from the plan that we choose.What was the main thing about insurance friends?If âXâ happens then give me financial protection.âXâ in this case of insurance is, if illness happensor hospitalization happens. If I were to ask youa very simple question which is, what is theprobability that you at the age of 25-35-20,whatever age you are, or your immediate family,could be your partner, your kids,what are the chances of their hospitalizationas against what are the chances ofhospitalization for your parents?Then obviously, the probability for yourparents is more, and that is why is they arein the same plan as your familyâs,then unnecessarily you would be givingmore premium for that coverage.Coverage means what is the amount offinancial protection you get.Premium means how much are you payingto the insurance company annuallyfor that amount of coverage.Why? Because in health insurance, everythingis derived from the oldest family member.So for example, if your parent is 60 years old,and you are 30 years old, then premium willnot be decided based on your age, it will bedecided on the basis of your parentsâ agewhich is 60 years, and that naturally means,since the probability of them getting hospitalizedis more, you will end up paying a lot more.So the first thing which I will strongly recommend,whenever you choose a life insurance planfor your parents, then make sure that it isonly for them, do not include yourself or yourfamily in it. There is a separate episode forthe family's insurance plan, in which we willcover all the details but for now,we will focus on parents itself.What are the things in health insurancewhich you should take into account thatyour parents will need? There were a fewthings which I had listed and I am justgoing to read it out.First and foremost, which is the main thing,hospitalization expenses. God forbid,if your parents get hospitalized, due tosome illness, or some surgery or so on,then all the expenses, doctor's visit, room charges,test charges, ancillary services, all of thosecan be covered by Life Insurance Company.Second, pre- and post-hospitalization expenses.If the hospitalization is declared or pre-decided,for example, a surgery, then a few days beforethat and a few days after hospital discharge,all your expenses for recovery or preparation,that is also provided by the insurance cover.Critical illness cover- if there is anycritical illness like cancer or so on, a cover forthat too which need not be aroundhospitalization but can be around justmaintenance of medical expenses.Daycare procedures- they are limited butstill there. Procedures where you do notneed hospitalization but it is like an involvedsurgery, for example, cataract surgery,so there are some insurances which covercataract surgery or Daycare surgeries also.Domiciliary hospitalization- these are thethings which we came very huge especiallyat the time of covid. At home- if you cannotgo to the hospital, so whatever treatmentyou are getting at home will be covered as well.And then pre-existing illnesses which arevery important. Since our parents are aged,it is possible that they may have a problemof BP, diabetes, and when we are buyingthe insurance for them, they may alreadyhave these illnesses, so how does theinsurance take care of that, is also animportant question to you ask.So keeping all these things in considerationwhat are the things that you should bear in mind.The first question is the aroundhospitalization and the room rent their itself.Friends, many insurance companies allowyou room rent of up to 1% of your totalinsurance cover. For example, if yourinsurance cover is for 5 lakh rupees foryour parents then 1% of it which is5,000 rupees is what is the maximumpayable amount for your room rent.For ICU it is 2%, that is 10,000 rupees.If you live in a big city then you would knowthat in 5,000 rupees you don't get hospitalrooms especially if it is a private hospital,and you definitely will not get ICU in10,000 rupees. So, the first thing you haveto bear in mind when you are buyinghealth insurance for your parents is,to know whether there is a capping on theroom rent or should I take an insurance planwhich has no capping. Of course,my preference would be where there is nocapping, you should buy that insurance plan.Second, post-hospitalization expenses.Many insurance covers or plans do not coveryour expenses once you are dischargedfrom the hospital. That is not desirable,so you will take an insurance policy whichwill provide you post-hospitalization expensesas well for a period of time, usually,that interval is for 30-60 days, where allthe expenses which are post-hospitalization,attached to the illness or whatever surgeryfor which hospitalization happened,that will be covered, that is somethingthat you should bear in mind.Third and perhaps the most importantthing is, PED for pre-existing diseases.As I said, since our parents are aging,they may already have some illnesses,it could be BP, could be diabetes,which are the two major illnesses in India.If it is so and they are hospitalizedbecause of these two,If it is so, and because of these diseaseswhich are pre-existing, before you tookthe insurance, if there is any surgery orhospitalization because of these, then will theinsurance company bear its expenses or not?So, typically there is a waiting period,there is a waiting period for PED,which could be anywhere from one yearand the standard is 4 years, which meanswhenever you buy an insurance plan foryour parents, then they will not get acover for the any of their PED orpre-existing diseases for 4 years,after that only they will get a cover.So, naturally when you try to take aninsurance cover, then choose the leastwaiting period possible. My preference isone year, there are some plans whichtake up PED from day 1 itself. They of course,will be very expensive. One year is usuallya good time, if you know that thePED is in control, diabetes is in control,hypertension or BP is in control,and you know that at least for one year,God forbid, nothing will happen.So you can wait for a year and after one year,if any hospitalization is required dueto these illnesses, then insurance coverwill be given. This waiting period shouldbe as low as possible. Please do notcompromise on this, please don't bepenny wise and pound foolish, and don'ttake a long waiting period for your parentsto save money. Based on this the thirdquestion that I am going to discuss aboutcorporate and individual, this becomesvery important, I will come to it,keep watching the video.Next thing as a said, family floater plan,please avoid it because as you add yourselfto the parents' family plan then necessarily....No, once againNext thing, family floater plan or a planfor parents only. As I said, I will notrecommend a family floater plan. Why?You are young, if you are married thenyour spouse and children are also very young,so you can get a higher insurance coverat much less premium, but if you will addyourself with your parents' health insurance,then you would unnecessarily be payinga much higher premium. So, take twoinsurance policies, one for your parentswhich is totally dedicated to them,take as much insurance cover as possiblein that, I would recommend 5-10 lakh rupeesfor two people is safe, and take separateinsurance for your family, which will havea much lesser premium, I will actuallyshow it to you how less that can be,and that will be the smartest thing to do.Don't try to take a single plan by addingyour age to your parents' age. Insurancecompanies will try to sell you this onlybecause they make much more moneythrough you when it is a floater plan.Avoid this mistake, do not go for afamily floater plan with your parents.I will share the consideration of afamily floater plan with you in the next episodeof The Complete Guide to Buying Insurance,watch out for that.If you are working then it is obviousNoIf you are working then it is quite likelythat you have got corporate Health Insurance,great because corporate Health Insuranceusually covers your partner, your kidswho are your dependents, sometimesyour parents and your in-laws also,which is great. Now the question is,should you take another plan and if not,how should you think about it?As a said, two things come under this.Cut, I will start all over again.If you are a salaried employee whichmeans you are working somewhere,then it's quite likely that you have acorporate health insurance plan.In the corporate health insurance plan,you, your partner, your kids who willbe your dependents, and your parentsand in-laws are also covered. If it happens,great! It is something that you shouldabsolutely take and cherish, but thereare two things that you must know.Number 1, when you leave the company,then your health insurance is canceled,and if there was a waiting period forpre-existing diseases in that insurance,then that also gets reset. This is veryimportant and many people do not knowabout it. So for example, your corporatehealth insurance plan is with a 4 yearwaiting period on PED or pre-existingdisease of your parents. If you leave thiscompany at the end of 3 years then thewait of those 4 years is wasted.Now, after 3 years again, if you takethe same insurance plan but in someother company, you will have to startall over again. To prevent this,either do not leave the company till thepre-existing period does not get overor another thing, which is the betterway to do it, you can transfer yourcorporate plan to an individual planbefore you leave the company.When you do this your waiting periodcontinues, even if you leave the companyafter 3 years, but if you got it transferredfrom corporate to individual plan then itwould take you only one more year inthe individual plan to complete thewaiting period of the PED.Please understand this carefully.The second thing, as a generalrecommendation, since thehealth insurance gets canceled wheneveryou leave the company and you will haveto take an individual plan, which willhave its own terms and conditions,so it is better to take another separateplan for your parents in addition to thecorporate plan. It's not necessary totake it for yourself because as I said,you guys are young, the probabilityof your hospitalization is much less,and by God's grace you remain healthy,but don't take a risk for parents.Even if you get a corporate plan andyour parents are included in it,please take separate health insurancefor your parents.The final thing is about your 'no claim bonus'.If you did not claim anything in one yearwhich means, there is no hospitalization,you did not touch the insurance cover,you did not utilize it, then everyinsurance company gives a no claim bonus.In which form do you get this bonus?In the increased form of your cover.Usually, it is 5%. In other words, if youhave taken an insurance cover of5 lakh rupees and you have not claimedanything for one year, then at the endof the first year or the beginning of thesecond year, when you renew this policy,the company will give you a no claim bonuswhich is 5%, that is 25,000 rupees.So, next year for the same premium,you will get a cover of 5,25,000 insteadof 5,00,000 rupees. This is just theinsurance's way of saying, 'Thank youfor not using any of our claims in the year',and this also is a great way to incentivizeus so that we don't start claiming frivolously.Many times, it so happens that if thereis a small surgery or anything like that,we think it's better to get hospitalizedbecause it is covered by the insurance.This is a great way for you to not fall inthat trap because insurance should beused only for critical things, when youdo not have any money at all,please do not use it randomly,that is not the best use of it.Keeping all these things in consideration,now let's go about how to pick the rightinsurance plan for your parents.We will use policybazaar.com for this.It is the best way to do it, you cancover and compare all the insurance plansnicely, it gives you everything out thereand the best thing is that it's free,it has the best prices online, so youwill never have to give anything extrato anybody, this is the differencebetween buying insurance directlyand buying it through an agent.The insurance company always givesa commission to the agent, which iswhy you will always find the pricegiven by the agent to be more thanwhat you will find directly. My suggestion,that is what I do personally, I buy allmy insurances directly online becauseit's cheaper and I get to compare a lot.Let's go straight into it.Sorry, the internet is weak, that iswhy wait, it's loading, check 1 2 check.Now we are on policybazaar.com,I am clicking on health insurance.When I do that, internet is slowAs soon as I click on health insurance,it shows you everything, the good thingis all covid-19 treatments are covered,no medicals are required, you canpurchase instantly, even with your parentswhich is a big blessing, because how willthey go and do it. In the email, I've writtenankurtesting, I've entered a random number,now I will continue, and then I am basicallypicking up the plan. I am doing it for'my parents', age of the eldest member,my parents are right now, they arequite old but let's assume they are 60,so I will enter 60 and continue,my residence is in Faridabad,and then I will go on next. They ask forthe pin code so that they can giveyou the list of the nearest hospitals.What are the existing diseases?So, yes I want. They were never covid-19.Any surgery?Yes, there was one.What are the existing diseases?Hypertension is something that is there.And then I 'view plan', and when thathappens it gives me a list of all the plansthat are available on policybazaar.com.Ok, so now the first thing that we will dois choose a cover because that is themost important thing at how muchpremium are we taking. My suggestionwould be that, you should take a coverof 5-6 lakhs, and that's somethingthat I would say, we will apply.When you do this thenIt is also important, 29 plans for fatherwho is 60 years. For mother, pleaseedit it and enter your mother's age as well,so let's say mom is 58, I am just pickingnumbers, so 'apply', and we will seewhat are the plans. It is still showing 29 plansbut they are loading right now.Aditya, speed up these things becausethe internet is slow, so I can't help it here.Ok, so now it's showing 37 plans, andthey are listed down in multiple orders.First of all, no room rent limit, as I saidthis is something that I would absolutelygo for because I do not want to haveany limit on the room rent, becauseI don't know to which hospital we would go,it could be a private hospital, it could bevery expensive. If it is a government hospitaland it is not so expensive then maybe theroom rent will be applicable but I do notwant to take that chance, so I will say no,I am not going to do that. So suddenly,37 plans have come down to only 6 plans.That is the big difference. Of course,they are more expensive now but it'snot that significant. If you see this, thatplan was around 2,400 rupees and thisis for 2,600 rupees per month,so for 200 rupees per month or2,400 rupees per year, I am not goingto give away that. So, this comes toabout 31,000 annually, it has fivecashless hospitals. Let's see the existingwaiting period, you will see 'no preference'or 'cover after 1 year', so let me justclick on 'cover after one year' becauseI want to see through this, what are theplans that I will get. Unfortunately, thereare no plans for this, so what I will haveto do is, make it 'no preference' and apply.And I will have these. Now one thingwhich will be very interesting is,if I reduce my father's age from 60 to 58,and let mom be 58 only, and then I will apply.Health Insurance assistant is coming again and again.So you can see that there are a lot ofplans like this. Let me put 1 in existing,and I can see there are 6 plans.You will see there are 6 plansand this is how it goes.There is Star, Pro Health, and thereare two more plans, Health Plus, etc.If you go on 'view features', it will giveyou all the details. This is Max Bupa I guess,claim settlement ratio is 96% whichis always a good number, and fasterclaim processing, no room rent capping,which is great, it is only for suite or above,where we will not go, the existing periodis 3 years. And then you go to features,bonus on no claim is 1 lakh every claim-free,maximum to 5 lakhs which is great,so they will keep adding and hence yourcover will automatically keep increasing.What is the claim process?Which are the cashless hospitals?Since I entered Faridabad, so thereshowing all the hospitals of Faridabadas an order. So, there are a lot ofdetails in here. Plus what you can do,which is the best thing that I like is,you can actually compare. So, if I wantto compare these two, then I can justactually click on compare, and it willthrow up an entire page that will showme the different features of the two plans,or the multiple plans that I select.So, I can actually compare between 1 and 2.So like here, the sum assured is 30 lakhs,it is not actually 30, it is cover plussomething else, so I am not going tocompare this and this, but yes, if I haveto do, then let me just make this 20,then it will be apples to apples,then it will be a equals comparison,so I will make this also 20. Suppose youare choosing a cover of 20 lakhs for yourparents, so you'll see the big difference,here it is 40,000 rupees and here it is60,000 rupees, the term is for 1 year,there is no room rent eligibility,so both of them are equal.Bonus on no claim, this one is givingyou more bonus, this one is giving less.Restoration of cover, share claim payments.Do they do health check-ups or not?Is there a maternity cover or not?But of course, there will be nomaternity at the age of mom and dad,like that movie starring Ayushman Khurana,it was a funny movie, I remember.What all is covered before hospitalization?So this is 30 days, 60 days.After hospitalization, it is 60, 60.So, there are many such details whichyou can actually compare. This willactually be a way for you to make thatpurchase. As I said, Policybazaar isat least my default way of picking andcomparing insurances, because all theinsurance companies work with Policybazaar.It is not biased. So, it's not like one is pushing,and then the other is pushing at times,you make the decision whatever way it is.The most important things thatyou have to cover are:Pre-existing diseases, its waiting periodshould be as less as possible.Room rent, there should beno limit to it ideally.No claim bonus, the more the better.Please take an individual plan foryour parents, don't take a family floaterplan, even if you have a corporate planstill take an additional plan for themspecifically because they need it.I hope this was useful.If you have any other questionsrelated to health insurance,or specifically related to health insurancefor parents, then please do not forgetto ask in the comment section.This is the complete guide to buyingThis is The Complete Guide To Buying Insurancein association with policybazaar.comas my knowledge partner.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
