So, start recording at my end as well.Great.I'll be speaking into my camera, Seth.So, if I don't look at you,that doesn't mean any disrespect.All good.Awesome. I will take careof the introductions later on.We'll go straight into the conversation.Thank you so much for joining infor today's conversation, Seth,it's such a pleasure to have you.Well, thank you for leading.It makes a difference.Fantastic. I, want to dig right awayand speak about your latest book.You're not the writer, but you've donea terrific job of compiling the worksof 300 odd volunteers, if I'm not wrongacross 40 countries, which is nota trivial task and centered aroundone very powerful topic that I believeis of importance for the entire world.I wanna start with, what was the genesis,at what point of time did you believethat you wanted to spend direct energiestowards climate change and havea very active conversation around it?Well, about 16 years ago,I wrote a blog post about climate change,and amazingly,it did not solve the problem.And I felt like, I didn't have enoughpower or leverage to make a difference.About two years ago, I read a book,called The Ministry for the Futureand it was profound.It completely changed the way I lookedat the world every single day.And I realized that one of the thingsthat had been holding me backwas that I was under-informed,that I had been persuadedby powerful oil companiesand other plastics industries to believethat the carbon footprintwas my responsibilityand that plastics recycling could work.And that there were all sorts of big,industrial things that were on the horizonand I didn't need to worry about it.And after, working my way throughMinistry for the Future, I realizedthat none of those things were true,but I thought if I am under-informedand confused, I bet a lot of other peopleare too, and I've made almanacs before,some of the best selling almanacs ever.I did this one just before the internet.And so I could have madean almanac by myselfbut that wouldn't have been a metaphorfor what we were trying to do.And so, I devoted so far,a year of my life, full time,15 hours a day, every day, 7 days a week,to helping to lead an organizationthat would produce The Carbon Almanac.And so far it's in, what I have here?This is the Italian edition.This is the English edition.There's a Dutch edition.There's a kid's book.There's a photo book.There are 40 podcasts.There's an educator's guide.All of us are volunteers.Every penny that comes in,we spend to promote the work.Nobody has any ulterior motives hereother than to start a conversation.And it's a conversation aboutsystems change.This is not about shaming peoplebecause they didn't recycletheir water bottle.It's about creating the conditionswhere we won't have water bottlesin the first place.And that will happen whenthe systems begin to change.And so far, The Almanac is makinga difference in that direction.I love the idea.I loved the power behind the idea.I wanna go back Seth,to the point that you madeyou have written so many books,bestsellers all them,written almanacs as well,but you wanted this to bea collective because that's essentiallyhow climate change would also pan out.How did you go about deciding,who these volunteers would be?Whether they're in it for the real thing,whether their interests are alignedwith yours, as that would not bea trivial task, I assume.So there are lots of lessonsthat can be learnedfrom how this community came to be,and how we produced this,a 97,000-word book,all with volunteers, in 5-1/2 months,all fact checked, all footnoted.It's got hundreds of 5-star reviews.It worked.So the first thing to understand is,I didn't write it.And that took discipline,cause I knew how to write it,but it wouldn't have been as good.And instead, what we did was,we didn't pick who the writers would be.We opened the doorand people who were readyto commit to going on the journey,showed up and people who wanted to gosomewhere else, we asked them not to.We said, this isn't for you.So create the culture.That's the first step.What are the things they like around here?People like us do things like this,the smallest viable audience of people.We had thousands of peoplewho would've wanted to do one thing,but we wanted to do this thing.And then I had to establish standards,standards about how we talk to each other,standards about what a good articlelooks like. Not a good article.We had to create a software structure,an infrastructure.Every single article in The Almanac,was written by 5, 6, 7, 8 people,layering on top of each otherone after another,sort of like Wikipedia, but with no trollsand nobody being anonymousand people treating each otherwith nothing but respectand dignity and possibility.And, so we have a couple principles.One principle, is nobody is qualifiedto write page 19.Page 19 has never been written before.We can only begin page 19and then each person is ableto improve page 19,until finally it's ready.And the second idea is the ideathat no one ever criticized anybody else,we criticized the work.Now we said this paragraphcould be better, not you are a bad person.And those two things in combinationcreated the conditions.One guy Vivek,who lives outside of Bangalore,Vivek ended up beingthe prime contributorperhaps 30 pages of The Almanac,40 pages of The Almanacand his first pages weren't very good.And he'll be the first personto tell you that now.Because he didn't have the rhythm andhe didn't have the confidence yet, butpeople took those pages and rewrote them.And then he saw where they were goingand his next page got better.And this is a metaphor forhow we build everything.It's just, we tend to hide it behind,heroic individuals, when in fact it'sa community that makes a difference.Fascinating.I would love one day for an organizationbuilding almanac to come from you,because what you shared is frankly,something that every organizationought to have believed in so far.And it's a tragedy that most people don't.They don't even realize,that is what is awesome.When I went through this book, Seth,the one thing that really stayed with meand wonderfully so, is I would usethe word, it's a very patient book.And the reason I say that is because,it assumes you don't know,but you wish to know,and it starts with almost kindergartenlevel appreciation, empathy, and patience.And I found that very endearing,because most climate change,I would admit,tends to be very dismissive.It's almost like, hey, you don't getthe science, sorry, you're not qualifiedto have this conversation.You don't get a seat at the table.Was this a conscious call?Yes. It was consciousfor a couple reasons.The first one is this, peoplewho meant well showed up and theyhave been as brainwashed as I was.They believed that they could just shameother people into doingthe carbon footprint stuff they'd beendoing, everything would be fine.So we had to be patient with each otherto help decode what was actually going on.Also, while we had a few PhDs on the teamthe vast majority of people on the teamcould read thoughtful workby climate scientists,but weren't climate scientists.And so they had to explainit to each other.Like so when you hear that concreteis 8% of all of the human contributionto climate change, 8%.It's mind blowing. How can that be?So we had to patiently explainto each other how that could be.I didn't know that we use coalto create 2000-degree furnacesto make concrete.I thought concrete was just some stufffrom the ground you had water to.So you explain these thingsto each other and you go, oh,that should go in The Almanac.Cause that's what almanacs do,they explain things to peoplewho don't understand them yet.That's beautiful. I love that.Now I can see why that makes sense.The other emotion that I experiencedwhile reading the book was,because I come from India,we're a developing country.We're also very ambitious.There's always this sense of, oh,before the big guys, the G-7s,the Chinas and the US' of the world,don't get their act together,why do we have to be the one stepping in?Like they have far bigger contributionto this mess than we will perhapsfor the next 200 years, which of courseis never a smart argument to make,but is unfortunately an argumentthat even politically gets made,when you see this and you also recognize,and I love the fact that noteverything boiled downto the four Cs that contributeto climate change in a big manner.Would you take that forward, extrapolate,and say that climate change decisivelyneeds to be led by the first tensand then the rest happens or like,how do you visualize this happening?Okay. So what I keep coming back to,is a systems change.There are systems all around usand we take them for granted.Texas, one of the biggest statesin my country, the United States,their main exports are carbon.There are, you know, cattle and oil.That's what comes out of Texas.And that's what's gonna keep comingout of Texas as long asthey can make a profit doing that.So we can't shame Texasinto not doing that anymore.The same way we can't shame Saudi Arabiainto not pumping oil out of the ground.It's not gonna happen.On the other hand, the biggest solar farmin the world is in India.And what we are seeing is that the priceof solar and wind is now lessthan the price of oil.Well, guess what?That leads to a systems change.Add to that appropriate regulation,to price properly, the cost of carboninto things like plastic and oil,and suddenly the system will reward peopleand countries and companiesthat build a different thing.And then the world will begin to shift.And where is that likely to happen?It's probably not gonna happen in Houstonbecause in Houston, Texas,all the pressure is to keepthe system the way it is.They don't want to change the system,but I gotta tell you,when customers say,why should I buy electricityfrom a coal plant? I can buy electricityfor free from my backyard,the people who run the coal plantare gonna to start listeningbecause the system is changing.And so what we need instead of individualsquietly composting in their backyard,or instead of individuals shaming someonein another country, we need to say,how do we build a system herethat accelerates the same way,the system of capitalism pavedthe Earth in less than 20 years.We know how to do extraordinary thingsas humans when the systems are lined up.And does that, I love the fact thatyou brought in capitalism herebecause that would have been my segue.Do you believe that this system changewill ultimately be a changein the capitalist way of lookingat energy itself, it'll have to have someeconomic incentive for someoneto stop something and focus on let's saynon-renewables or renewables.I alternate between beingoptimistic and pessimistic.When I am pessimistic, I realizethat human beings care about conveniencemore than just about anything.They care about winning.And they care about making surethey have more than enoughand that's sort of universal.So, when it comes right down to it,even people who are livinga certain kind of life,still put milk in their coffee,coffee, milk.Those don't work in a worldwhere we are in an emergency setting.So what are we gonna do about it?Well, if we wait until it's an emergencyon everyone's front door,it will be too late.So the way that we move forward is,guess what? Carbon's really expensive.It's gonna cost you and yourgrandchildren, your great-grandchildrenmore than we can calculate.So we're gonna start building the priceof carbon into the things you buy.And if that happens, it would takeless than a week for consumers andorganizations to shift how they behave.Capitalism is the answer.Because capitalismis the single best method ever inventedto solve market problems.So if we make this a market problem,it will get solved by the market.So, what that means is you've gotta say,oh! this in a glass bottle costs a dollar,this in a plastic bottle costs $5,what am I, an idiot?I'm gonna buy it in the glass bottle.And when we think about how something'sgonna get shipped wrapped in plastic,wrapped in plastic,wrapped in plastic,put in a cardboard box,what you're saying, yeah, you can have itthat way, but it's twice the price.People will make new choicesbecause what capitalism has done,it's taken advantage of the factthat we've been having basicallya yard sale giving away free energy,that isn't actually free.That's wonderfully put.I'd argue and saythat this would also be perhaps the reasonand I'm a little ignorant around this,of why individual effortsaround climate change have failed.And we've never really had a collectiveresponse to it, because at my end,your end, yeah we can not take flightsand yeah we can reduce meat consumption,and yeah we can avoid plastics and so on,but it really becomes choice as againsta capitalist incentive to do so.At a collective, things change completely.Now if that is indeed the case,do you believe that the systems changethat we are all working towardswonderfully so, needs to proceedthe individual consciousnessof working towards climate change?Like people fundamentally needto alter the way that they're thinkingabout even their own life.So, I live near New York city.And New York city was going to haveto shut down 120 years ago.There was just no wayto successfully live there.And the reason is that people werepeeing in the Hudson river.People were dumping their sewagein the Hudson river, cause it was easyand convenient and cheap.And once they figured out,that was killing peoplethey didn't say, please, please,please stop peeing in the river.What they did was, they made it,A) Against the law andB) They built the sewer system.How many people neededto make that happen, less than 1%,if less than 1% of the populationspeaks up and speaks up and speaks up,very clearly, the government says,yeah, we're gonna build a sewer systemand we're gonna make it against the law.And that's how we ended upwith New York city.The way systems change is not thateverybody gets together and agrees.They change cause 1%, 2% of the populationspeaks up persistently and consistentlyuntil the system is changed.And what BP, British Petroleum did was,they persuaded us that what we shoulddo with our energyis lower our carbon footprint.And they did that duplicitously andI'm just not proud as a marketer that,that's the most successful marketingcampaign of my lifetime, but it is.That what we need to do every singletime we're tempted to make a small change,is instead make it, so that leaf blowersare against the law, instead make it,so that there's an appropriate pricefor jet fuel, et cetera, et cetera.Because if 1% of the populationmade that their cause it would happen.That leaf blower thing, by the waywas like what, what an hour?Oh my God, that was crazy.And the other one was, it was also that4.6 billion changed into 46 hoursand we have had success come in the lastone minute and we've destroyed 50%of what we had in that period, crazy.One last question, Seth,before I leave you to your day is,now that The Almanac has come out,it's clearly a success.I already see so many conversationshappening and frankly I'll have to admit,did not believe that, that was possibleat the level that it has.What would make you happywhen it comes to the outcome of this?Like what change would you wanna seeand is there a time limit to it?Is there a goal or a targetthat you're working towards?Is there something that you're quantifyingor is it just somethingthat you are waiting to experience?Well, there are two answers here.The first answer is somebody who has spenta year working on this full time,I'm already delighted, because it wasn'tabout what happened after it came out.It was what do my peers and colleaguesand friends who worked so hard on this,what happened for us?And it changed our lives.And it allowed us to create somethingthat we are proud of,and that we wouldn't do differentlyif we did it again, it was miracle.As a parent, as a future ancestor,as somebody who grew upin the woods of Canada,what the only thing that I am hoping for,is that smart caring peoplewake up and changethe system before it's too late.And, every day, you can find thingsto be frustrated and disappointed in,American Airlines, just put in an orderfor 30 supersonic jets that pretendthat they're gonna be run onsustainable fuel which is nonsense.But on the other hand,every day you see systems in placethat are changing things for the long run.And the optimist in mesays, we can do that more.So that's what I need to see,that it needs to be as much of a basicfundamental part of our conversation,as freedom, as anti-slavery,as the other thingsthat we believe as humansaround the world, because we've changedthe system, this system can change.And it's because people like you show upand spread the word.If we talk about it enough,we're gonna be able to make a difference.Fantastic on that note,thank you so much. God bless you.Thank you for all the work that you'veput in for compiling this together.And I am certainthat at some point of time,hopefully in our lifetime itself,we will witness the system changein a way that we had imagined.Thank you, Ankur.It's a pleasure to talk to you.Likewise, Seth, all the best.
