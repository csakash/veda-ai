Since we are talking about exams,the education systemof international countriessees exams in a very differentway. For example, do you knowthat mostly the exams thereare open book,which means they do not careabout what you remember,they care about how you can applywhat you know.This is one of the simple thingsbut such a powerful thing to changethat how we learnfrom exams,and ultimately, in life,how we apply it.So,because I have studied in the US,and many of my friendshave been brought up inUK, Australia, Canada,I have learnt a lotfrom this education system,and that's whyI always say that if it is possiblethen atleast once in a lifetime,one should study abroad.The mind opens up,one gets a verydifferent experience.But if you are struggling that -which country you should go to,which course you should opt for,how to fund it,how will you get the visa,how will you get accomodationthere, how will the application be,how to prepare for the test -for all those things,what I would recommend isLeverage Edu.Leverage Eduis India's one of the topstudy abroad consulting firmswhich sends manystudents, every year,outside Indiato studyand then they know that they willone day, come backand start delivering.Leverage Edu, is India'sone of the topstudy abroad consultingfirms which sends 1000s ofstudents abroad every yearfor them to fulfilltheir dream of studying abroad.I am one of Leverage Edu'sinvestors.Akshay Chaturvedi, who isthe founder of Leverage Edu,is an ISB alum and a good friend.So, I am clearlyvery biased when I say thisbut, thisbut I have personallyseen many students benefitfrom Leverage Edu servicesand I would highly recommend them.LinkLink is in the pinnedcomment and descriptionwhich you can click and immediatelyfill the application for Fall 2023and their deadline.In the pinned commentand description,there is a linkthrough which youcan set up a counselling sessionand for Fall 2023,which is the September intake,and the deadline for whichwill be in July,you can apply.
