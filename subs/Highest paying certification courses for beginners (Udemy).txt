Check 1, 2.These days, I receive several emailsfrom students saying, "Ankur,I want to do acertificate course because manypeople say that thesecertificate courses are helpful.Are they helpful? And if they are,which are the certificatecourses that we should do?"I come from a time wherecertificate courseswereseen in a bad way.Because at that point, certificatecourses were like a fraud.Some random teacher is therewho is trying to teach something,they would teach in a small corner.Because certificatecourses used to be offline.Now certificate courseshave largely become online.And because of that,the game has changed.Because, most of thecertificate coursesthat are really good,are organized byindustry professionals.And they need not begeographically co-located for you.They can be anywhere.They can teach you inany corner of the world.And you couldbe anywhere in the worldand be their student.So the certification andknowledge you get at their levelis vastly differentfrom what it usedto be during my time.So my first reaction was that -Who will do acertificate coursebecause anyone cangive money and do it?There is no qualification,no admission criteria.But when I satdown and researched aboutit and I also spoketo a lot of students,I realized that thesecertificate courses these daysare very beneficial.And along with yourcore education, whatever graduationyou have done,post graduation you have done,if you complement thatthrough certification courses,you actually become more employable.With this, there are many platformswhich offer reallyhigh quality certificate coursesand one platform which I personallyuse a lot for my personal learningand are the sponsor for this video,that is udemy.com.This video issponsored by udemy.com, which isone of the world'sbest known platformsfor online courses and educationbecause on Udemyyou get on-demand classes,best professors and instructorswho are very qualified, are professionally trained,are educatorsand have worked in the industry.Millions of students use thatand its pricing is very attractive,which also comes witha 30-day refund policy.So,So considering everything, thisbecomes a great platform for themSo considering everything thisbecomes a greatplatform for studentsto learn. And in this video,I wanted to ask Udemy's team thatwhich are the certificate coursesyou can see yourstudents use the mostto become employable.They sent a list of about 5-They sent a list of10 certificate courseswhich are best-selling,most importantly, are the mosteffective, according to thembasis theThey sent a list of10 certificatecourses, whichaccording to them are the mosteffective and the reason for thatwas student review or feedback.So many students who havetaken these certificate coursesgave their feedbackand were sayingthat with thiswe got many opportunities,our employment potential increased,we got many job offers,and that's why I would highlyrecommend this to others as well.So, in this video, we will try toknow those 10 certificate courseswhich are are available on udemy.comand I hope you can benefitfrom them.Firstly, 5 reasons howcertificate courses,particularly from Udemy,can help you.Number 1. Skill development.As I said, it is obvious thata certificate course,in very little time andin a very organized fashion,develops your skill.So in a few hoursyou learn a new skill.If you put in few more hours andpractise it, you suddenly become atleastabove a beginnerand that gives you a new skillthat you can use to flauntyourself.Number 2. Flexibility.All of Udemy's courses areon-demand, so it is notthat there will be a classthat there will be a class orany set schedule of the startand end. Youcan study at your rhythm.Like you are watching this video at1.5x or 2x or 1xas per your choice.I have recorded it at one speed.That is a flexibilitythat it gives you.You can start it any time,you can end it any time,you can watch it at any speed,you can watch it several times,all of that,is at your control.Number 3. Affordability.As I mentioned,many of Udemy's coursesare very affordableand if the pricing,at any point seems a lot,they have many sales going onwhere as a new customer,who has never bought from Udemy,you can buy courses.I remember buying itfor as cheap as Rs. 399 or so.And this will be a completefull-fledged course.There will be no hindrances in this.It will be a 20-30 hour courseand only for Rs. 399, which isridiculous for the level of qualitythat you get for that price.Number 4. Quality education.As I mentioned, manyinstructors, in fact,all instructors on Udemyare qualified.They are senior professionals,they have done it for several years,their ratings and reviews show thatlakhs of studentsfollow them,they have made many courses,they are renownedand stalwarts in their field,and that makes it soawesome becausewhile sitting at home, youcan learn from thebest intructors.Number 5 - the final thing andthe most important thing,particularly for you -these certificate coursesimprove your job prospects.Because anythingyou add in your skillis only going to make youa better professionalfor the job thatyou are applying for.So these are 10 certificate courseson udemy.comwhichjob prospectsSo these are 10 certificatecourses on udemy.comwhichSo these are 10 certificatecourses on udemy.comwhich can increaseyour job prospectsa lot.Number 1.

Java,now as well, is very popular,despite the fact thatit is so old, like even in our timesJava was there.Anyway, 85,000 studentshave takenthis course. This is run byImtiaz Ahmad. 23,000,almost 24,000 ratings.4.5, so, highly rated.It is a 17.5 hour course.As you can see, many top companiesoffer their employees these courses,which is always a good sign becauseif companies are doing thisthen naturally these companieswill give the same importanceto any other person which they willgive the internal employees.You have all the basics of theirYou have all the basics of JavaYou have all thebasics of Java in therein 4 sections.Requirements are very basic.You don't need to have anyprogramming language, Javais the most popularprogramming language in theworld, suprisingly still.As I said, many updateskeep coming, so that'salways a good thingand if you read the reviewsyou will see that mostly peoplereally really like it.This is Imtiazand he is the one who is instructingthis course, which is the JavaComplete Certification Course.Next, Microsoft Azureis done, so how will Google Cloudstay behind.

So if yougenuinelywant to become a rockstarin cloud comptuing,then I would say Azure,GCP and AWS,take all 3 courses, because thenyou are accomplished.Any company willbe on any one of these definitely.There are very few companies whichare outside these three.And that means you will have literally99% coverage if anycompany is looking for people for itscloud computing orservice infrastructure.You will be right up therewith these certificate courses.Next up is 'The CompleteOracle SQL CertificationCourse'. Oracle, now as well,is a very verypopular language.160,000students have taken this course.42,000 ratings, 4.6 ratedand it's run by Imtiaz again.16.5 hours.A lot of content, as I havealready mentionedfor all the courses.Absolutely noprogramming experience is required tomaster the content in thiscourse, which is so good right?Because imagine, you area graphic designerand you are like, 'You know what,many people are talking about AIand coding, whatwill it feel to actuallybe a coder,to go outand start programming on your own,and see if it adds to my skillset?I am already a graphic designeror say, a digital marketer,or say, a video editor,but if Ilearn this programminglanguage as well,it only addsto everything that acompany would love about me,with me.'

Why?Because it is veryvery generalist andnon-techie kind of a course.PMP meansProject Management Principles.And ideally theAnd ideally, in every company,there is a need for atleastone PMP professional.Somebody who just manages projectsat a fundamental level.So, if there is any project,in that youdon't have to execute, but insteadcoordinate the peoplewho are executing it.You have to manage timelines.You have to decidetimelines for tasksand coordinate tasks.Keeping everything in mind,you have to executethe project nicely,to be able to deliver it,all of that is a reallyimportant task and almostevery company out thereand imagine if you are certifiedin that process itself. 1.5 lakhstudents have taken this course.45,000 ratings,4.7, which is incredibly high.It is a very elaborate course.39 hours ofon-demand video, whichmakes it one of thelongest videos that Ihave atleast come across on Udemy.Mostly the courses I doare under 10 hours. But 39 meanssomeone has put in a lotand made a 40 hour course,which is almost equivalent to2 semesters.I don't know if you know -if you do 1 semester in any college,in its courseusually the number of hoursrange from 20-22 hours.Which means this isalmost a year equivalentof a full-time coursefor one subject.And that is thepower of what you getat your doorstep, wherever you are.You will see everything outthere, including the examinations,and that is great.This is run byAndrew Ramdayal.And you will seehe is very experienced -15 years ofproject management experience.There are very incredibleratings, which isof course testimony to the fact thatmany students have taken this.So something that I would highlyrecommend.Next up, 'The Complete SalesforceCertified Administrator withChatGPT'.Around 134,000students have taken this course.32,000 ratings, 4.5.Salesforceis the biggestsales managementtool or software in theworld. And many companiesuse Salesforce. ButSalesforce isa very complicated software.So to be able to customize it,personalize it,to be able to maneuvercompany's processesaround Salesforce,all these things are somethingthat usually in-house experts do,or there are many dedicatedSalesforce agencieswhich are brought on boardfor the company, for a shortperiod, to set up that infrastructureof Salesforce forinstance, for the company,do the job and then get out.So you, if you are certified there,can act as one of those experts -whether within the company,or outside the companythrough the agency.33 hours ofon-demand video, whichis quite impressive.Again, many companies use thisfor their internal employees.You will seehow everything,right from theSalesforce administrationto using ChatGPTwith or without,all of that is built in, which isfairly impressive.And it is run by MikeWheeler and AaronWheeler.Are they brothers?Evan Wheeler is there as well.And Ezekiel Wheeler is there as well.Wonderful. Soit is a Wheeler family business.And32,000 ratings as I said,4.5 rated, which is extremely high.AndI love the fact thatfor you to understand a toollike Salesforce accurately,there is a 33 hourcourse for that as well.And run by the instructorswho are just so goodwith what they do.What a time to be alive!Next, Cisco CCNA 200-301 -The Complete Guide to GettingCertified. 177,000students have taken it.53,000 ratings.4.8 rated,which is incredible.It is by Neil Andersonand is almost for 40 hours.And this is what it is -you basicallywill get readyto pass the Cisco CCNA 200-301 exam.I do not know what thespecifics of this is. Thiswas shared with us by Udemy's team.So I do not specifically knowwhat this Cisco CCNA200-301 exam is.It must be a certification examwhere Cisco will then qualifyyou to be a certain expert,it must be something like this.But essentiallythink of it like a JEE preparation -you are taking a FIITJEE orAakash Tutorial's courseand here you are taking their course,which is how it willallow youto understand everything about theCisco infrastructure and becomean experton that.Absolute beginners to networkingare welcome -which is the best part.You do not know anything aboutnetworking. Cisco basicallyis a networking company.So you do not knowanything about networking.But you want to seeor learn that skill,maybe through that you getjob opportunities.And Udemy has saidthat by taking thiscertificate coursemany students havereceived job opportunities.So why not try?And in literally 40hours and whatever amount this willbe, which right now is like Rs. 799.In Rs.800 and 40 hours,you will learn somethingwhich might give you a newprofessional stint. Ifind that incredible if youreally think about it for a second,like for 2 moments, think and see,that in Rs. 800and 40 hours,you will get something to learnwhich might become a new wayfor your profession or career.I love that.I love that bet, I would place that betevery single day on me.Neil Andersonis the instructorand you will see thatthere is a fair bitof experience thathe comes with. 53,000 ratings and 4.8rating, that isreally incredible.Next, 'The Complete AgileScrum Fundamentals Courseplus Certification'.92,000 students have taken this.There are 16,000ratings, it is 4.4 rated.12.5 hours of content.And basically Scrumis a project development processand thatis the mastery that theywill share with you and teach youin this certificate course.So, every single thingwhich you can learn -Scrum and Waterfall -these are usually 2 approachestowards any product development.And if you knowScrum or Waterfall,then you essentiallybecome an expert inone of these 2 areas.You can of course learn both of thosewhich is always a good idea.Andthe instructor for this courseis Mauricio Rubio.It looks like a guy,he is the one who runs this course.And 17,000 ratings, as Isaid 4.4, which is not bad at all.And that is whatthis certificate coursewill give you.And finally, the 10thcertificate course 'InformaticaPowerCentre -Beginner to Expert Level'.25,000students have taken this course.Around 6,000 ratings.4.4.What is this?So here iswhat you need to know.ETL stands for ExtractTransform Load.Basically there is adata management processand Informaticais the most widely used ETLtool which is used toextract the raw dataand load it ontothe target data after making sometransformations.
