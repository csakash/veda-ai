How much money do you need to retire?We often don't know.But there is a great rule calledthe 4% rule of financial freedomwhich explains it.Imagine that your yearly expense as of nowis â¹10 lakhs.Multiply the amount by 25,and that is your amountfor financial freedom.This means if your yearly expenseis â¹10 lakhs,then you need â¹2.5 crores to retire.If you have â¹2.5 crores today,then do an FD of 50% of it,invest the 50% in the stock market,and withdraw 4% from itfor your yearly expenses.This will go on for 30 years,and you won't need any more money.Financial freedom!
