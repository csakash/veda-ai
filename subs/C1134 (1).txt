Now, for this,there are multiple factors that come in.I remember when I, in 2002,I was 20 years old,no, I was 22 years old.I started it in 2001,in fact, let me start with this,To apply outside,you need multiple months of preparationcoming in.Like I am shooting this video in May 2022,you are just in time for the fall2022 session or intake.Fall means the session that startsin August, September session.You are definitely well within timefor the spring session 2023.That happens in January, so January 2023.And you are absolutely in timeif you want to apply for fall 2023,anywhere between four to 18 monthsis required.Anywhere between four to twelve monthsis required for youto do a good job of applying.And it is contingent on thatwhat country are you applying inwhat course are you applying for,and naturally, if you are applying forBachelor's or Master's or for MBA.So, that is the first thing this videowherever it hits you,whenever it hits you.You need to be very clearwhat intake do you want to apply first.It's not important that fall 2022...No, drop this.Now coming back to all the factorsthat comprise a decision thatwhat course, which country.I would argue that the first thingyou need to think of is, whatever you'vealready done in your school or college,what could be the natural extension of it?So I was a bachelor's of physics student,and my natural extension was I wanted todo Ph.D.Because I wanted to become a scientist.So I wanted to go for my Master's program.And that too in physics.This is the first claritythat you need to have.If you don't have any clarity,on which course to pursue,then you need to know why do you wantto go abroad in the first place as well?It could be for exposure,absolutely, it could be to earnmore opportunities and money.It could very well bethat you want to target certain industrythat's not readily accepted here in India,or have been established outside.It could be that you alreadyhave relatives who can give you thekind of support that you needif you go out.Multiple reasons can be there.All of them need to be brought inplus a big factor of money.Because internation education,tends to be more expensive.Scholarships are very importantfinancial aid is very important.Leverage Edu has a lot of thesescholarship opportunities for youand they also help you apply for them.But it is importantthat you need to have a ball parkthat how much is the tuition feeshow much would be the living expenses?Even if you get the scholarship,how much could you get?Apart from that,how much you need to give?Would you be able to get a financial aidor loan or anything like that?If you can't get it,how much of your own moneyyou need to give?All of these factorsare important for youto evaluate before you decideon which course to takeor which country to go.I would argue the following.This is what I did.First of all, choose the country,country will cleara lot of things for you.For me, US was the absolute choicebecause I knew that space education,that I wanted to study,is the best in the US.But if you are, let's say marketing,marketing could be greatin Europe, marketing could be awesome,in Australia, marketing could be...Marketing could be brilliant.Of course the US as well.But even if you go to Canada,even if you were to go to...even if you were to go to Canada,even if you were to go to Europe,but not necessarily UK,you will still have great marketingexperience come your way.Even in APAC, in Singapore, in Hong Kongyou will have enough and more good qualitymarketing education rendered to youand that then becomes a factor.That what field you want to get into,but almost everything is determined by thecountry and then Leverage Eduhas this very smart AI course finderwhich I found fascinating.Because what it does isI'll show it to you in a second.It gives you which all universitiescould you apply to and it breaks it downinto your dream universities,these are your reach universities which isthere are a lot of chances here.but it's also good enoughand these are you safe universities.Where there are almost very high chancesneed not be so good.But, if you apply it in a mix,you will then make sure you arespreading the risk aroundand having a high probabilityof getting through one of them.At least let's see how it worksbecause it's quite interesting.So, I am on the set of Leverage Edu,and if you go to productsthen the first one is AI course finder,which is there.Let's start now.So if you look at it, at first,it asks for the countrywhich is the key thing.Let's say I want to go to Australia.Okay. Continue.And I want to go for my Master's.Yeah, let's do MBA. Let's do MBA.Do you have work experience or not?Let's say I don't have it.Okay. Change track and this isvery good advice, right?You don't have significant work experiencewith your current profile,we recommend to explore other Mastersprogram which is true.Because, in Australia,without work experiencegetting an MBA degree is very, very hard.So, maybe say, no I have it.How much is it? And I'll say I have,an experience of 12 months, okay?Now he says...so, let's say I have an experienceof three years or 36 months.We'll continue. Okay.What is your highest educational degree?And I'll say I have done undergrad degree.What is expected or gained percentage?So, I got 75% in my bachelor's.Let's say, I've done BBA.Which English exam have you takenor are planning to take?So, I selected TOEFL.What's the score of it?So, if you haven't opted for TOEFL,you might not know.But, if you have opted for TOEFL,or let's say not planning to take.Which academic test have youtaken or planning to?Not planning to,because I don't know what to take.And then it gives youthese options, so what is your dreamuniversity. University of Melbourne,and what are the reach universities?University of New South Wales,University of Adelaide,What are the safe universities?Murdoch University of Tasmaniaand so on and so forth. There are a lot.If you login, you'll get all the details.There are a lot of filters here,And you can do the exact same thingwe have courses too,so you can decide courses.Here you have MBAbecause you chose MBA.So all of these are MBA programsand this is such a smart simple waybecause none of this was availablein my time.If I go back anddo the same thing and let's see if...So US, continueand I want to do my Master'sand I have done my under gradI got 75. Then I want to do sciences.Sciences, continue.I had given my TOEFL.I think, in TOEFL, I got...How much was it on TOEFL?I got, let's say, 110 in TOEFL.What did you give next?I first gave GRE, in GRE I got...I'll have to see.I got 160 in GRE verbal.170 in that. Continue.In which university did you study?So, I studied in Delhi University.Continue.I published research papers too.It was not index,it was a non-index journal.Did you have any experience? Yes.How many months?I did for around 12 months. No.I did for around five months.Extracurricular, I did extracurricularin inter-school university.Experience with NGO?No, I don't have experience.And then it gives me the list.14 dream universities,so, six reach universities.80 safe universities.Right, so a lotto choose from and there are courses too.Now, of course, all of these courses maynot be what I want to do becauseI want to do specifically MS in physics.As soon as I login and go to filters.I'll be able to get all of this.This is such a great tool,such a simple one, of course free of cost.And that is a way for youto get started and figure.As I've told you the...As I've told you start with your budget,because that is a great determinant.Till where can you go?Start with the countrybecause that is a very good determinantthat if your budget is applicable to thatAnd then use somethinglike the AI course finderon Leverage Edu to figure what alluniversities, what all coursescan you apply for.Depending on what all have you donein your past.Once you've done that,the next thing is exam prepand exam prep is very importantbecause before applying to anythingyou need to getthe results of these exams to you.Because, exam results then determinein what universities can you apply or not.So when you went throughthat course finder you saw,very clearly that based onyour exam results' score,universities will be suggested to you.If the score is less,then a lot more safer universitiesif the score is high thena lot better universitiesor higher rank universitiesso on and so forth.If you are going to US for your Bachelor'sthen, SATs are importantTOEFL which isTest Of English as a Foreign Language,is important. Both of them are mandatory.If you are going for you Master's then GREwhich is the Graduate Record Examination,that is important,TOEFL is always important.If you are going outside of the US,then the SAT and the GREmay not be required butthey will require IELTS examination,I-E-L-T-S.If you are going for your MBA,then GMAT becomes the main determinant,it's used in ISB too.So, wherever you are going,depending on the course and the countryyou will have to give some exams.Preparation for these examsare very important.Usually these exams,except for, like, SAT or GMAT,They will typically haveverbal reasoning, like,a few english questions.They'll have quantitative reasoningand logical reasoning a few math questionsand then they will have written and spokencommunication test, that can happenin TOEFL and IELTS too.Most of the Indiansget stuck in verbal reasoning.Because our englishis not our native language.Our english?English is not our native language.At least it's not for most of usit was not for usand it is hard because English is asit is a very funny language.So, a lot of things were not taughtproperly in the school.They never explained it.So, it becomes very complicatedwe are usually good at maths.Especially if we are applying for sciencesengineering or even GMAT.So, in my experience I figuredand this was only after reflectionIn my days, in my days? In our days...But, in my time, in my days...in my time, there were two books,one was princeton reviewand the other was kepler.Which used to be the Bible ofpreparation for these books.And only once I consumed these booksdid I realize science harmony.There's a sciencebehind verbal reasoning too.It's not in the air.It is not about if we know Englishthen you could get a good score in it. No.Even my friends who usedto speak English fluently,They didn't even score very wellbut I managed to, because there is acertain science behind all of thiswhich I understood from these books.Because the competition has increased,we get so many opportunities,so much access,that books may not be enough.which is why there are a lot of thesetest preparation centersthat come in. Leverage Edu, too, preparesyou for the test.Across all of these main examsand batch size of 20very personalized attention.They give you all the scientific reasonsof how to crack these questionsso on and so forth.So it's definitely something that you canadd in addition tofinding course, taking scholarshipso on and so forth.But preparing for these examswould be somethingthat I would highly recommend.They don't require a lot.The JEE, NEET, it's not on this level.It's definitely not a the level of CAT.They're like 9 and 10th leveland I think, between one maximumtwo months of preparation should set youup on a good foot, which is whatthe duration usuallyis for all these courses.So, you prepare for your exams.And as the first stepsdecide on the universitiesfigure out what is the scorethat they requireto be even comparatively,in the range of getting an admission.And then study hard for the exams.This is your first steptowards studying abroad.In the next episode we will coverhow do you go about applyingand how do you go about preparingfor the interview of these collegeswhich is very, very different from howwe do it or are used to doing itin the Indian context.And then final, we'll cover financial aid.We will cover visa.We'll cover preparationfor leaving accommodationand all of that to completethis complete guide to studying abroad.Powered by Leverage Edu.I hope this was useful,if you have any other questions,if you want to know in the next videosthen please let me know in advanceso I can attend to them.Ankur Warikoo.
