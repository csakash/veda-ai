Should you have a lot of credit cards?Yes and no.There are five reasons for yes.Number one:More purchasing power.If you have a lot of credit cards,they have different credit limits,by adding all credit limits,you can make a big purchase,of course in parts,And that makes it easy for circumstanceswhere you need money,you need to make a major purchase,to make a planned purchase whereone credit card may not be enough,of course, the credit card's credit limitis based on your salary,then it may happen that yourtotal credit limit across all your cardsmay be less or equal to your salary.But nonetheless, you can expandyour entire credit limit byadding multiple credit cards.That's reason number 1.Reason number 2:Very important.A credit card hasa credit utilisation ratio.Suppose you have got a credit cardof â¹1 lakh,means you've a credit limit of â¹1 lakh,and out of that you spend â¹90,000on an average every month,then your credit utilizationis 90% on an average,but this is not a good number.Why?Because higher credit utilization,means a weaker CIBIL scoreor credit score.One very important ingredientin the CIBIL score is yourcredit utilization ratio.The more you use your credit utilization,the more negative it will impactyour credit score.That's why if there are many credit cards,then you can divide the same purchaseof â¹90,000 into 3 or 2 credit cards.So if you have two credit cardseach of â¹1 lakh,then for the same purchase of â¹90,000,you can do 45 on 1 cardand 45 on another card,and your credit utilization ratiois now 45%,and that will be betterfor your credit score.That's why multiple credit cards helpyou lower your credit utilization ratio,reason number 2.Reason number 3:Better CIBIL or credit score rating.When you pay 100% credit card forthe whole month with full dedication,why did I say the whole month?A whole month doesn't mean every day!Paying 100% of your credit billsevery month diligently will improveyour credit score,and the more credit cards you pay off,the better.Why?Because the credit score will recordthat you have multiple loans going on,because the credit card is just one wayof taking loans, and you are paying backthose loans in a very smartand truly disciplined fashionevery single month.Friends, for this it is very importantthat you pay 100% of yourcredit card bill statement every month,because credit card companiesdo a big fraud, I will not say fraud,but there is a kind of gimmick for themto earn money called'the minimum amount due'.If you pay only the minimum amount due,you will feel as if your credit cardis still in operation,but you will be payinga very high interest rateon the rest of the amountwhich is anywhere in the rangeof 35-45% annually.It is the most expensive loan thatyou can take in your life,and I will not wish that for anyone.So if you pay your 100% ofcredit card payment regularly every monthwith full discipline, you will improveyour credit score,as your loans would be gettingpaid back properly.Number 4:And the strongest reason for this isyou get multiple rewards and benefits.The best utilization of credit cards iswith the purchases thatyou anyway have to do,you do them through the credit card,and then you earn points.This is how I play my credit card game.I have four credit cards.Three are personal and one is corporate.In fact, this is another reasonfor having multiple cardsbut I will come to that.Let's talk about the 3 personal cards.I have an Amex card,an Axis Bank Vistara card,and a City Bank premier miles card,and I use them for different purposes.I use the Axis Bank cardfor big purchases.Why?Because it gives points that goin my Vistara account.I pay my children's school feesthrough the credit card,I buy a gadget or furniture for homethrough the credit card.I do regular purchases throughmy City Bank card,because points keep collecting there,and after 3-6-12 months,we convert those pointsand buy Amazon vouchersor some hotel vouchers.It is quite limited.And then I use Amex formy international travel,because usually Amex givesgood exchange rates,but more importantly,Amex is extremely secure.God forbid, if there is some fraudor the card is stolen,then I know that I can relyon the Amex customer experience far morethan the other cardsand that's why I use that.It is not a recommendation,and I'm not speaking about specific cards,but it is very important to knowthat every card has its own specialty.There are cards that are specificto brands.For example,there are Amazon credit cards,which you can use to earncashback on Amazon,which is very hard to do otherwise.There are credit cardsfor flights or Airlines,just like I have Vistara's,and Jet will be launched,when I took City Bank,it was at the time of Jet,and it's going on because premier mileswas a privilege point of Jet,similarly, there is Indigo,and so on and so forth.You can earn points for flights.There are many for specific merchantsfor specific brands,and you get a lot of points.So if you have multiple credit cards,you are able to use them effectively.Also when there are big sales,especially on e-commerce sites,like the Great India sale on Amazon,or Big Billion Day sale on Flipkart,so you get a lot of cashbackon these credit cards,and if you have multiple,then you would know.This is for my IndusInd.This is for my HDFC.This is for my SBI.And you can then play around withall of those credit cards.So the biggest advantage of havingmultiple credit cards is the rewardsand benefits that you getfrom having all of them.That's why whenever you usemultiple credit cards,please ensure that their reward programsshould not be overlapping.If you get the same discounton the same merchants,then what is the use of two cards?Please look out for as many exclusiveand independent reward programsas possible because they will give youthe maximum benefit on your credit cards.So reason number 4, maximize yourrewards and benefits.And reason number 5:Fraud or theft.It seems counter-intuitivebut I will tell youthe counter-intuitive part of it as well.But God forbid,if one of your credit cardsgets stolen or lost,then you can instantly block itand make your purchases fromthe remaining credit cards,and that is the benefit.I remember this because this isa personal incidentwhere I lost my City Bank credit card,and I instantly called them up,I blocked that card,but after blocking that card,sometimes cards are stored in sitesor in recurring subscriptions,and now it will have to be a new card,so when will it come, when will it go,and I was running a lot of servers thereso I could not block it,so I instantly used my second card,put that up, and of course,I had to change it,and I could also use itfor any transaction I had to doin the offline space,but it is the powerwhen you have many credit cards,you can instantly keep usingyour purchase through a credit card,even if one of them gets lost,and has to be reported for blocking.Number 6:Bonus reason.If you are a corporate owneror run your own business,then by having multiple credit cards,you can isolate your personaland corporate expenses.My 4th credit card isa Razorpay corporate credit card,and I use that forcorporate purchases only.Whether it is hardware, flights,hotels for corporate travel.And all of my personal expense happensthrough my personal credit cards,and that is an added benefit.Doesn't apply to everyonebecause most of us are studentsor working professionals,but if you have your own business,then to be able to record separateindividual expenses is an added benefit.Now it sounds like havingas many credit cards as you want,3-4-5,but here are the disadvantagesof having multiple credit cards.Number 1:If there are so many cards,then tracking their paymentsor if any fees have been added by mistake,it becomes a very tedious task to be ableto track your accounting,and that is why many peopledo not have a number of credit cards.But this has been solved by businesseslike Cred.If you go to Cred's appand enter your details,it will automatically fetchwhich credit cards you have,and then you can track all of that.At least I find it very convenient,that's my biggest reason of using Cred.I haven't been able to do anythingwith its reward points to date,but it is super efficientwhen it comes to tracking all my cardsand of course making payments.So that reason can be solved bya business like Cred.Number 2 which is the biggestand the scariest reason:When you have many credit cards,and your credit limit increases.I have â¹1 lakh from here,another â¹1 lakh from here,so I have â¹3 lakhsbecause I have three credit cards,which gives you the illusion ofa lot of money and it then enticesyou to overspend.I have â¹3 lakhs,whereas you don't,and now I can spend it!Wrong way of thinking about a credit card.Never see a credit card as a loan.Use a credit card just like a debit card.The only difference is thatin a debit card the moneyis deducted instantly,here you pay that money after 30-45 days,but the money has to be paid in full.So whenever you make any paymentwith your credit card,do it only because you havethat entire money alreadyor it is going to come in 1 month,so that on the day the bill is generated,you can credit the full amountby its due date and enjoy the card.But a lot of people fall for this,especially if you are young.So I will warn you and this isa big warning that having multiple cardscan be very dangerousif you do not have the willpower,if you just buy random things on saleonly because it is on sale,and just waste a lot of money,and then at the end of the month,you realize that you never had that money,and then you get into that cycleof credit card debt.A miserable trap to fall in.My own family was stuckin this trap for years,I know how it feels,I do not want anyone to go throughthat experience,please never make that mistake.Number 3:Credit card fraud or theft.If you keep all your credit cardsat one place,and you lose the same wallet or purse,then that is again a problem.Like I have three credit cards,I don't keep them all in my wallet.One is at home, actually two are at home,because both of them are mostly usedfor online purchases,my physical card of Citibank,and my corporate card,only they are in my wallet.So if God forbid, my wallet will be lostthen only those two cards will be blockedor will have to be blocked.It is a big risk if you takeall your credit cards everywhere,because then it means if it is lost,then all your credit cardswill be lost together,and that could be a big risk.And number 4:Based on number 2,if you start spending money blindlybecause you have credit cards,then you will not be able to makethe full payment,and then you will get caughtin that credit card debt.You don't want to fall into that trap!You don't even have any idea thathow much and what it meansto pay 30-35-40-45% interest rateevery year.It is insane because it growsso fast that even if you keep payingthat basic minimum amount due every month,your overdue amount will keep onincreasing,and the next thing you know,it is gone out of control.So you don't want to do it.Now keeping all these things in mind,my recommendation is thatif you are a sorted person,if you are smart,if you know how to make money from money,then please keep multiple cards.Use those multiple cards in such a waythat you can earn benefitsfrom their reward points,they have different uses,and different credit limits,divide your expenses for the whole monthso that your credit utilization ratiois low,pay 100% payment due every monthaccording to the rules,so that your CIBIL score keeps improving,and you get the benefit of allthe reward points that they have.This will be the smart way of doing it,and I will highly highly recommend it,if you can do it then do that,because then businesses like Credtake care of the managementof these cards,and a big headache has now been solved.I have also made videos onhow you can use credit cardsto make money for you.And this is not something thatI recommend for peoplewho are 30-40 years old.There's an itch to make moneyin your 20s that if you make evena little bit more money,it's like we've gauged the system,hacked it, and we like it that way.So I will tell you in brief how I do it,I used to do this in my 20s,I don't do it now,actually in my 30s also I did itfor a long time,as the expenses increase,it becomes a better way of doing it.What do I do, as I told you thatI pay 100% ofthe entire credit card expenses,but the advantage of credit cardsis that when you are spending,then you do not have to make that payment,you have to do it after 30 or 45 days.So let's say, I have my salarythat comes in at the start of the month,then there is my monthly expensewhich is quite a lot,let's say it is â¹3 lakhsbetween my wife and me.Now I already have â¹3 lakhs,but I am making that purchase of â¹3 lakhsthrough my credit card,so I'll have to pay that moneyat the end of the next month,so I then park that â¹3 lakhsin a debt fund,where I get a basic but fixed return.By the way, I can put it in an FD as well.Till I get a fixed rate of return,and it will not cost me to liquidatethat fixed depositor sell that debt mutual fund,it doesn't matter to me.I will get that 4-5-6%,now the interest rates have increasedso much that even FD rateshave increased, its 6-7%,somewhere it's 8%,but I will not put it into a risky bank,I will not put it intoa random Warikoo Cooperative Bank,I will put it in a secure banklike HDFC, SBI,or some good debt mutual fund.And if that â¹3 lakhs will be lying thereeven for 1 month,if it earns even half a percent,and half a percent means â¹1,500,but that â¹1,500 is free money,it is absolutely free money.Like you don't have to do anythingto earn that money,so every month,I will earn â¹1,500 for free.And that will be the way thatI run this machinery.When I have to paythe credit card statement,I will liquidate that â¹3 lakhs,be it a fixed deposit or debt mutual fund,and I will make that payment.So for free, by doing nothing,I will get â¹1,500 a monthwhile just sitting.Now, of course, that number may not beas big for your purchases,but as I said, it's fun.It is not something thatyou are doing to become a millionaire,you are doing it because you understandhow to make money work for you,and you are smart aboutall of these thingsbecause each and every dropgradually makes an ocean,and that's how I want your mindsetto become.Your money is not worthless,it is your hard-earned money,and don't let that hard-earned moneygo to waste,please don't treat it likeit's a demeaning person or something.It is valuable, treat it with respect,because the more you respect money,the more money will respect you,and that is the relationshipyou want to have with money.Don't run after money,money is not to be flogged,respect money,because then money will respect youin return.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo,
