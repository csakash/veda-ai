Check 1 2 check 1 2Aditya, in this video nothing ishappening on the screen,there is no animation,there are no notes,so it's a conversation,the video is about, when is it ok to give up,so it's very conversationaland also a very deep emotional video.So treat it in the same mannerlike you treated the video'When I was lost at 24',so make it cinematic, add music,just bring about that element.Shivam you can also give somesuggestions for sound effects,anything that adds to the emotionsof this video, ok?We are all told not to give up.Don't give up!Don't ever give up!But in this video, I want to sharewith you all those instances,which I think are enough for us toactually consider giving up.Friends, whenever we are doinga difficult task, which we are not able to do;whenever we are trying to pursue an ambitionfor many years but still we are not ableto achieve success, the world keeps telling us,don't give up, don't ever give up,don't you dare give up,and we all feel that giving up is a failure.Giving up means that you have accepted failure.You accepted that he cannot do it.It was obvious that you could never do it.You were chasing something in your own passion,which you could actually never achieve.And we feel super shittywhen we have to give up.Give up on our dreams.Give up on our path.Give up on our ambitions.But in this video, I want to sharewith you all the instances,which according to me if you reachthere or experience them, then maybegiving up at that point would bethe right decision for you.Recently, we went for an off-siteto Rishikesh as a team.And on the second day, there was anactivity of high ropes, where ropeswere at a height of 30 feet,and we had to cross all those obstacleswith a harness on. There were 13 obstaclesin all, and it was a very very intense activity.It was sunny, but in general,if you have a fear of heights,if you have a fear of falling which we all have,it was physically demanding,because many times you would be swingingon a tyre, and you would have to go onanother tyre while swinging,so it was very very demanding.I went up to the 12th obstaclebut I was totally exhausted by that time.My hands were aching because we haveto hold the rope to cross all the time.We were not wearing gloves. I wasnot able to handle my body weight.So, at that point in time,I decided that I will not be ableto continue, and I was brought downwith the help of a pulley.One team member, who also reachedthe 12th obstacle, and she wasround about the same, a little ahead of me,but she also began to give up.Like, it was very visible thatshe was in discomfort, clearly,she was very tired, she wasn't ableto get there, and if she would have crossed,then the 13th obstacle seemed tobe relatively easy, and actually,it was, at least that's how it seemedfrom below, so the feeling was to crossonly that one obstacle, and one ofmy team members who was standing nextto me below, we were motivating her,telling her to go on and go on,which is usually what people do,she said,it's OK to give up.If you don't want to do it,it's totally ok.And when she said that, she basicallyshared and explained that,we all are repeatedly told not to give up,people who give up are losers, butit should be ok to give up.And I don't know why I kept thinkingabout that, and I realized thateven I have given up many timesin my life.But I think when I reflect uponall of those instances when I gave up,I realized that I did that forthe right reasons.To complete this story,the team member who was up on that12th obstacle did not give up,and she was one of the only two girlswho actually finished it in a teamof 12 other people. Only two peoplefinished it, both of them were girls,so high five girl power! I loved it!And it was amazing and super inspiringto see them complete that.But that's not the point.The point is when is it ready to give up?I remember I was preparing for IITin my 11th and 12th, I was preparingfor IIT-JEE, and I did not takeany coaching because we could notafford it. I was good in physics,average in chemistry, good in maths,and I continued with thecorrespondence course at that time,called Brilliant Tutorials.But if I really think about it today,I think I was lying to myself thatI thought I could make it.Because I think I knew at that timethat I am not that smart,I am not able to work that hardand I may not be able to clear it.It was not an admission thatI did not want to give it a shot,it was more about, I guess,I did not have the mediums to achieve that,and especially in the light of thecompetition that there was.So, I think the first reasonwhy it should be ok for you to give up,is that you know in your heart thatis not going to work out. It can betrue for relationships,where we know in our hearts that,though we are in this relationship,it is still not going to work.I know it because of the complications,because of what we are settingourselves for, because of whowe have become, whatever.You are preparing for something,you are working towards something,there also you know in your heart that,however hard you may work,you know it's not going to work out,and not necessarily work out froman outcome perspective,but work out for you in life.Even if you clear that CA exam,even if you become a doctor or an engineer,you don't know whether that willmake you happy, you don't know whetherit will eventually work outfor you or not. And if you everhave any such doubts, then I thinkyou should be ok considering giving up.Number 2, after ISB, which was myMBA Business School, I starteda consulting job, and consultingis a really interesting profession.You work with very smart people,you work on very meaningful projects,real-life projects, you are tryingto help big companies on big projectsto grow their business.And it had been three years inthat consulting job, and it wasbecoming obvious that this worlddid not need consulting.Like, I don't think there is anybodyin the world, who would wake upin the morning, and say,I wish I had more consultants.Nobody says that.Gradually I started feeling,I am good at this work,I get good money for this work,I am happy also in this work,but this work is not needed bythe world, in my definition ofwhat the world means.So, gradually I did not find mywork to be fulfilling.And whenever you find yourself ina spot where whatever you may bedoing, you do not get fulfillmentfrom it, you don't feel that thework you are doing is making youfeel good about yourself, your work,your life, your existence,then that could also be a reasonfor you to consider giving up,and it may be a valid reasonfor you to give up.I left consulting.I entered the world of start-ups,and I couldn't be happier doing that.Whenever you find yourself ina circumstance, where you areextremely sad, I am not sayingthat you are not happy, you arevery sad, then that is absolutelya reason for you to consider giving up.Sadness, ok, not discomfort.That 12th obstacle was a discomfort,that was momentary, that was pain,that was a psychological pressure,but it was not unhappiness.We were not sad, we were tired,we were exhausted, we were inextreme pain, but that was it.It was temporary. It will go away.But being sad may take a reallylong time to go away, it maynot ever go away.If you are not happy in your life,if you are sad in your life,in your circumstances, in what youare pursuing, in your relationship,in your job, in your team, then theremay be nothing worth your happiness.Nothing is more important thanyou being happy, and that may bea good reason for you toconsider giving up.You are not giving up becauseyou think, if you give up thenwhat will people say!The only reason for you not togive up is because you don'twant to spoil your reputation.You want to give up, you areactually ready for it but youare scared that what willsociety think, you are scared ofwhat will people say.I remember, when I was runningthe business for Groupon India,it was a lovely job, it was alovely setup, I was among thetop 50 employees in Groupon globally,it was a great salary, I was gettingimmense global exposure,I was getting to learn a lot,but I had that inclination thatwe can expand Groupon Indiafrom where it is, and I wantedto do it independently,because I knew that by beinga part of Groupon, it is definitelygoing to get destroyed.And to quit that Groupon business,to actually give up on that job,that career, that opportunity,and to start nearbuy.com,was a big decision.And I remember many people said,'You have a job in MNC, you willleave it, then start your own startup,there is so much of the risk,you will have to start from scratch,why are you doing it?What is the need for it?'People may think that I was fired,I was not doing well in Groupon,so I saved my respect by givingthem a fake story about Nearbuy.But the truth was I was very clearthat I did not care about whatpeople would say, people would think.My only objective was to go onand build something far bigger thanwhat we are sitting on.And at that point in time,I was so happy, that I did notallow the world's opinion of me,to take over my decision.You don't want to quit, you don'twant to give up, because youare scared that if you will notdo this, then what else can you do?You are scared that what youare doing in life, if that doesn't exist,then what else?You are in a relationship whereyou are not happy, it is toxic,you know it is not going to work,but you are still not giving upbecause you do not know how will yourlife be outside this relationship.You are preparing for CA, or engineering,or you are in a job where you arenot happy, but you are scared ofleaving it because you do not knowhow will your life be if you do notbecome a CA, or an engineer,or if you do not have this job.But that is a wrong reason to not give up.I remember when I was in my Ph.D. programin the US, do exactly what I wanted to do,I was preparing for it for thepast 8 years, but when I reached there,then I realized that though I amgood at physics, but doing it isnot making me happy. This is not howI envisioned my life. It was very clearthat if I continue doing this,then I might be successful,but it might not be happy,and it was evident at that point in time,that I will not do this.But did I know what will I doif I do not do this?NoI came back to India without any plan,without any sense of direction.I had no idea what is goingto happen in my life.Nothing was established.I had no way of earning money,I had no way of pursuing any other education,I had no idea about what job willI take and what will I do,if I had to pursue another degreethen what will it be.Everything had to start fromscratch at the age of 24.But I am so glad that I still gave up,because I knew that I would beunhappy doing what I was doing.Yes, I did not know what is goingto happen in my life, how will my lifebe without this, but I knew veryclearly that my life willnot be happy with this!You are working somewhere,you are in a relationship,you have a job, you are on a path,you are pursuing a goal,but it makes you feel poorlyabout yourself.It makes you feel as if you are not adequate.It makes you feel as if you are not good enough.It makes you feel as if you are not capable.You are in a relationshipwhere you always feel that youare disappointing your partner.You are not good enough, you arenot capable of making them happy,you are not capable of giving themwhat they want.You are in a job where you arescolded every day, where you aretold every day that you are not capable,that you are not right, that you willnot be able to do it, and you beginto feel as if you are not worth it.You begin to feel as if it is not possible.You begin to doubt your own self.You begin to judge your own self.You begin to harm your own self.That is the point when you shouldbe ready to give up because,in life, nothing is bigger thanyour relationship with yourself.And if any damage starts happeningto this relationship, then youshould uproot the reason for thisdamage and throw it out of your life,otherwise, it will just suck you in.Suck you in like nothing else!And last, you are doing somethingthat you now know is not right for you.But you are not ready to give upbecause you have been doing itfor many years.Time is what is holding you back.'Oh, you have already given itso much of time, you will leave it now?You will leave it at this position?You have been doing it forso many years, you will give up now?Are you foolish?'The same things were said to mewhen I was ready to drop out of my Ph.D.'You have been preparing for it forso many years, now you are already there,you have spent two years in Ph.D.,you will leave that and start all over?Are you foolish?'But that is not the reasonfor you not to give up.If you will postpone or neglectyour decision of giving up because of time,then you are making a big mistake.Because it is obvious to you,that what you are doing,wherever you are in life,you don't want to be there,you don't want to do that,but you are stopping yourselfbecause you have given it a lot of time,you have been doing it for so many years.The absolute wrong reasonfor you not to give up.I believe in this, and I ama living example of a personwho doesn't give up easily.But you must have come to knowfrom this video now, thatI have given up many times in life.I gave up my Ph.D.,I gave up my exciting professionof consulting,I gave up my lucrative job in Groupon,I gave up my position of CEO in Nearbuy,only and only because I knewthat I had a valid reason to give upwherever I was at that point in time.And all the reasons which are sharedwith you in this video, they shouldbe something that you also consider.It is OK to give up!But for the right reasons.And it is not ok for you to continueif you want to give up,but you are stopped becauseof those reasons.I hope this video was useful.I hope that you got the courage,the strength to take an important,maybe a hard decision in your life.This is my firm belief that whateverdecision you take in your life,you will take it giving yourselfthe first priority, you will makethe decisions after giving thefirst priority to your emotionsand your feelings, whether thatsuggestion would be to continueor to give up.Ankur warikoo, signing off!
