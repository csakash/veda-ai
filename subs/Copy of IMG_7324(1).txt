I recently made a videowith Akshat Shrivastav,and he shareda very interesting fact with me,which I want to sharewith all of you.If you look at the datafor 2012-2022,the thing which was for â¹100in 2012,now it's for â¹160!This means inflationmade things costlier by 60%.But if you look at the income,then the income which wasâ¹100 in 2012,has grown to â¹130 only in 2022.That means income has grownslower than expenses or prices.That is why the pace at whichyour income is growing,despite that,you are not able to save more.So, the way to get out of itis to either increase your income sourcesthrough various side incomes,or to start investing your moneyso that it grows fasterthan inflation.
