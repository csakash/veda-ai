Ok check 1 2 ok let's get startedHow can you create a passive incomeevery month through stock investing?We will get to know in this video.Friends, there are two ways of makingmoney when you invest in stocks.One, which everyone knows which is,the stock price increases, if you boughta stock for â¹100, and went upto â¹150, when you will sell it youwill make a profit of â¹50, that isthe simplest and the most straightforwardway of making money through stock investing.But in this video, another wayBut there is another way that I will sharewith you in this video. A way in whichyou will not have to sell anything,in fact just because you have a company'sstock, you will earn money, you can evenget it every month provided you play it right.This is called dividend investing.Dividend investing is a passive income strategyDividend investing is a kind of passiveincome strategy, which works on the basisthat you have a company's stock and youget dividends through it. These dividendsthen give you an income for which youdo not have to sell the stocks, you can earnwhile doing nothing, but how does it happenHow does dividend investing work?Why do companies pay dividends?Cut out the dividend investing partI will share 3 things with you in this video.Number 1, what are dividends?Why do companies give dividends?Why is it giving away free money?Number 2, to the passive income ofdividend in dividend investing,what are the things that youshould know to earn it?And number 3, which are those stocksthat you can choose to make adividend income or a passive income?First of all, dividend. Dividend is acombination of two words, divide and end.Dividend, divide and end.Whenever you buy a company's stock,essentially you are buying a small partof that company, however small it may bebut you surely have a certain ownershipof that company. So, when the companymakes a profit, which can be at the end ofa quarter or end of a year, so it has twoways to use this profit.First is to reinvest this profit in the company.It has opportunities that it can pursue.They think that if they invest in marketing,the company will progress. They think that ifthey make more products, company will progress.It could be anything else, they could chaseanother new market, new product,new opportunity, and that is usually thesign of a growth company. If a company isyoung, it's not too old, and it doesn't havetoo much profit, just a little bit of it, thenthey usually invest this profit back into thecompany and that will ensure that thecompany's stock price keeps increasing,and the company will keep growing.But another way is, that since we alreadyhave this profit, and it is a huge profit sincewe are a big company, so we are not surehow we can invest all of this money backinto the company, so we want to distributesome part of its profit or all of itamong the shareholders.Divide EndThe profit which remained at the end isdivided in the form of a dividend.So, companies declare dividends.They say that the profit that we haveearned, we can invest some of it backinto the company but we want to distributesome of it among our shareholders in theform of dividends, and that is how youmake money through dividends.The only thing that you have to do for this isto be a shareholder of the company.Basically, you have to buy that company'sstock and keep it with you, and if you havethe stock then you are earning money,not only from the appreciation of thestock price but for that you will have tosell the stock at some point, you are alsoearning through dividends.A good way to understand this is if you havea commercial property or even a residentialproperty, which you do not use yourself,there are two ways to earn an incomethrough to that real estate investing.One is, that the property's rate is increasing,so in the future, if you sell it you will makesome profit. But till the time that propertyis with you, you can rent it out which givesyou rental yield and it is free money.It is basically money for just owning aproperty. You don't have to sell thatproperty or anything like that for this.In fact in this, you have to make someexpenses for maintenance, but there isno effort after buying a stock. You havejust bought that stock, now the companyis working and making money,and through that it will give you a dividend,and that is how you will make money from it.Now, how does this work?Every stock does not give dividends.It is a company's decision to give a dividend.It is possible that a company that has beengiving dividends in the past, can now stopgiving it anymore, and a company that hasnever given dividends in the past,can now start it. It is completely thechoice of the company.That is why if you want to adopt adividend income strategy, then you willhave to pick those stocks which have beenregularly, in a discipline fashion been givingdividends every year, because now thatbecomes the habit of the company,the way that it works.So the first thing is the history of thedividend payouts in the company.The second is the dividend yield.What does dividend yield mean?It means, how much dividend has beengiven in one year as an amount divided bythe current stock price of the company.How much dividend was there inone year divided by the currentstock price of the company.For example, if the stock price of thecompany is right now â¹100 andthey had declared a dividend of â¹10in one year, then 10 by 100 which means10% is the dividend yield. The dividendthat the companies give is mostly in therange of 1-3%. If it's higher than 3-4%,then it is a very good dividend yield.If it is less than 1, then take it to be zeroonly or it is so little that it doesn't makea difference, like you have taken a stockworth â¹100 and you are not evengetting a dividend of â¹1 in a year on it.It is important to know and understandone thing for this. It is not necessary thatif the dividend yield percentage is morethen the dividend yield is also more, why?Because the denominator is the current stock price.Let me give you an example,Reliance share is for about â¹2000right now, it is actually for 2200 but let's assumeit to be 2000 so that the calculation gets easier.If Reliance says that my dividend yield is 5%,though I do not know how much is it,but as an example, it is 5%, so 5% of 2000is â¹100. But another company's stockprice is â¹500, and its dividend yieldis 10%, then how much did it givein one year? â¹50.Now we compare these two stocks,1 stock is giving 5% dividend yield and anotherstock is giving 10% yield, then you willfeel that the one which is giving 10% isbetter but no, because in one year Reliancegave â¹100 and the other stock gaveâ¹50 so Reliance gave more, so it isOh, it's working sorry I thought it got disconnected because of the call.So, it is important that you always convertthe dividend yield into an absolute amountand then compare it, because that iswhat is the ultimate thing, at howmuch money is coming in a year.The third thing then is, who is a shareholder?A very important metric or date forthis is called ex-dividend date.A company needs to know who theyneed to distribute money to,how do they even figure it out?So they say, we will declare a datecalled the ex-dividend date. Whoeverwould have our stocks BEFORE thisdate will get this dividend.For example, if the ex-dividend dateis 15th February of any year,then whoever would have thiscompany's stock on 14th February willget the dividend in the form of whateverdividend is declared, and that is how it works.It is extremely important that you shouldhave ownership of that stock as ofone day before the ex-dividend date.This is a very important criterion.Now finally, let's talk about how to pick them?There are two ways, one takes alittle hard work and the other one is easy.First, I will tell you the way which takeshard work, which is to do your own research.You will go on to moneycontrol.com,tickertape.com, and take out a list ofall the stocks of big companies, becauseonly their dividends are reliable since theymake huge profits. Then you will sortthem in the order of descendingdividend yield, which will tell youwhich stocks you can buy.Then you will do research on them,how is there income growth?How is the industry growth?How was the dividend maintainedin history? So on and so forth.This will take some hard work but ifyou do that job well and if you areinclined towards that research then youshould absolutely do it with full dedication.I cannot do so much because I am notan expert, I do not understand many things,whatever I understand I share it with you,so my information is of a very basic level,so I will go for the second optionwhich is buying a portfolio.Another good thing about a portfoliois that some of the other company isalways giving a dividend at some or theother time. And that becomes a greatway for you to generate this passive income.If you have 50-100 dividend stocks inyour portfolio, then some or the othercompany would surely be declaring adividend in a month, in a quarter,or in a year. If a company has not declareda dividend because it is going throughbad times, then another company will
a dividend because it is going throughbad times, then another company willdeclare more dividend, so on and so forth,so that's the power of a portfolio.Whenever I say portfolio, I can onlythink of one thing which is somethingwhich I've spoken about activelyall the time, which is Smallcase.Smallcase is a portfolio of stocksthat represents an idea. Smallcasealso has Smallcases based on the ideaof dividends. I want to share two of themwith you which I have personallybought to ensure that there is apassive income around dividends,and let's go and evaluate them.The first one is called Dividend Stars.When you log in on Smallcase, you cango to discover, and search for Dividend Stars.It is quite simple. It says dividend returnsare very important as they are anadditional income, as I said. So, thisSmallcase consists of companies thathave maintained an average dividend yieldof at least 2% over the previous 10 years.So basically, This Smallcase has workedat it and chosen all those stocks whichhave maintained at least 2% dividend yieldover the previous 10 years, which isas I said is a good number. Additionally,only the companies which have notcut dividends over the last 10 yearsare included, it is a possibility thatsome of the companies which gavea 2% yield, may have cut the dividendover the last 10 years, those companieshave been excluded. Another goodthing is that, in this re-balance occursonly once a year. The concept ofre-balancing is very important in Smallcasebecause Smallcase gives you 100% controlover your stocks. So you know at all times,which stock is being bought or sold,everything happens through yourDemat account so it is never out ofyour control. So in this, re-balance happensonly once a year which helps savemoney as well. If you look at stocksand weights, then it has Bajaj Auto, CSC,Chambal fertilizers. If I click on Bajaj Auto,then I can see a dividend yield of 3.53%which is great, and if I click on Chambal,it shows a dividend yield of 2.5%, whichis great, if I click on Infosys, dividendyield of 1.74, which is great.Naveen, Fluorine, remove these two I don't know why they put it here.If I click on Infosys, dividend yield of 5.33%,which is great. So, these are the stocksthat are available right now. You canstart with only â¹24000.All you have to do is just click on'invest now', it will ask you whetheryou want to do to monthly SIP forone time. You can even increase it asmuch as you want, so let's say you want toincrease it to 75000, click on 'confirm amount'.Never mind the required fundsbecause I am not investing in them.And then you will simply buy and get that in here.The second one is Dividend Aristocrats.It is slightly expensive because it has aminimum investment of 54000 but it isequally good. If you look at the stocksand weights in this, it has Asian Paints,Bajaj Finance, Infosys, ITC, Nesco,so it has a bit more stocks.Frankly from these two, my suggestionwould be Dividend Stars because this is great.Don't forget that you are not forgoingyour returns in this, just because it isgiving a dividend it doesn't meanthat the stock price will not increase.The stock prices of Bajaj Auto, CSC,Chambal having increased. If I clickon Bajaj Auto, then you can see thatthe stock has actually increased overa fairly long period of time, its one-yearreturn is 36 % which means if youwould have invested in this stock for a year,then you would have not only got 36%but also â¹3.5 on every â¹100 over and above,which is brilliant, right?Because that is how you get the magicof not just the stock appreciation butthe dividend yield as well.So why would you say no to it?And that is why its growth of 5 yearsis 26.65%. It has medium volatilitywhich means it doesn't fluctuate a lot,so you know it's quite stable.And the best thing is that it is free,you don't have to give any moneyfor this Smallcase.So I would strongly recommend,either dividend stars or dividend aristocrats,any of the two. In general, dividend investingis a very good passive income stream.You not only get capital appreciationor stock price increase, but you alsoget free money for every stock ownership.How are they taxed?Whenever a dividend is declared,10% TDS is deducted. Whateverdividend amount that you have got,10% of it will go towards tax, and therest of the amount is considered asother income so it adds up into yourIncome Tax slab, and is deductedaccording to the Tax slab you fit into.So it is simple and straightforward.The government takes away 10%beforehand and after that, we have to givethe tax according to your Income Tax slab.That's something that your CAcan easily handle or anyIncome Tax software that you use.Basic net net, if you have lump sum moneyespecially if you want to invest foryour parents or even for yourself thenride on the stock appreciation but why sayno to free money in the form of dividends.I hope this was useful.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
