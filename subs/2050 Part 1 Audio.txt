When we travel on flights nowadays,cigarette smoking is not allowedon flights,but do you know there was a timewhen it was a regular affairto smoke on flights?In fact, there was a timewhen doctors recommendedcigarette smoking.They used to say,I recommend xxx cigars to anyonewho is interested in regainingor keeping physically fit.There used to be many such adswhere they said,more doctors smoke camelsthan any other cigarettes,almost being endorsedjust like toothpaste.In fact, people even used to say,there was a particular cigarette brandthat could give you a fresh feeling.This was during the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s,only 50-70 years ago.My prediction is by 2050,this world will know so much aboutthe bad or ill effects ofcigarettes and alcohol,that they will be consistentlyover a decline,and by 2050, they may be wiped out.And there are a lot of countriesthat have already started makinga move towards that.I recently learned that in Australia,when you buy a pack of cigarettes,it doesn't have the logoof the cigarette brand.Only its name is written in plain text,and there is a big image thatsmoking causes cancer.Just think about it,you are buying a cigarette brand,maybe your favorite brand,and what it shows is thatsmoking causes cancer.Not just this,cigarettes are even expensive there.In Australia,a pack of cigarette cost upwards of $50,which is a pack for â¹2,500,if it has 20 cigarettes.I don't know whether is 10 or 20,but either way,you are looking at â¹100-200 per cigarette.Insanely expensive and harmfulto your body!It's just a matter of time beforethe whole world would knowthat cigarettes and alcoholshould be banned and will be banned.This is my prediction for 2050.I'll be taking a very interesting approachin this video, that in 2050,from all the things that could happen,which once do I predict will happen.It's almost like in 2023,I am launching a video,so that in 2050,all of you and I too can watch this videoto see which predictions are right or not.In fact, we can play this gameright now as well.Once you watch all the predictionsin this video,you can tell me in the comment section,the predictions that you thinkwill come true for sure.And let's see what happens in 2050,after 27 years.Prediction number 2:People will stop driving cars.It has already started happening.As you can see from the graph,if in 1983, 100 people betweenthe age of 20-24 years appliedfor a driving license,then by 2050, only 15 people apply.This means alreadythe number of applications fora driving license has reduced.And with more artificial intelligence,with more automated driving,with more electric vehicles coming in,and with software taking overthe car industry,my prediction is that by 2050,people will not drive cars themselves,cars will run automatically,and we will only be sitting in itand go wherever we want.In fact, it is also possible thatcars will not run on roadsbut in tunnels,which Elon Musk is already establishingthrough his Boring Company.Or we will travel or fly in flying taxis,and driving a car becomesa thing of the past.Do you think this predictionwill be right or not?Please tell me in the comments section.Number 3:Cash.Cash is still used a lot in India.We keep making purchases every daywhere we use our notes of â¹10, â¹20,or â¹100, but it has reduced a lot.After UPI, a lot of purchasesare done online through mobile phones,and this is a matter of time.If you will look at the graph,you can see the differencein the emerging marketor the mature markets between 2010-2020,in terms of using cash.The shocking story is China!In 2010, 99% of people in China used cash.In 2020, only 40% of people use cash.In India, 100% of people used cash,because there was nothing in 2010,because cash was the only way.And now in 2020, it is 89%.If we look at 2022-23,89% has been reduced to 80%.And my prediction is that by 2050,not only in India,there will no cash in the world.It will be 100% electronicand it may also be driven by cryptowhich is establishinga new technology of money exchangethrough decentralization.Who knows where it goes?What it becomes?But my prediction, for now,is that by 2050,there will be no existence of cash,carrying notes, or keeping moneyin a wallet will be completely gone.Number 4:Classroom education.We are so used to classroom education,that we have forgotten that100-150 years ago,classroom education didn't even exist.The was a principle of Dronacharya,or principle of Gurukul,our principle of combined group learning,where everyone used to geta lot of training in various disciplines.Not just in science,but in commerce as well,and in weaponry, and in philosophy,and they became completelearned individuals.But after the industrial revolution,there was a great needfor specialized people.A person to just paint a car,fix a part of a car properly,only fix a particular part of a car.And because of that specialization,the phenomena of classroom educationcame around, where a teacher taughta set curriculum in a class.They started it at the beginningof the year and finishedat the end of the year.And they used to make sure thatevery student was going throughthe same curriculum.And then it just became a norm.We got so used to it, that whateverour professors and our teachers taught us,we learned only that.If we failed, we thought of ourselvesas useless.If we passed, we thought we are amazing!And everything became centeredaround classrooms.My prediction is that by 2050,this will not be there.A new revolution has startedwhere people like you know thatwe can be responsiblefor our own education.We can learn through YouTube,Instagram, Netflix, books,and through people who are notour professors or teachersin school or college.We can learn through any personwho is not sitting with us,they can be anywhere in the world,but what they know is somethingthat other people do not know that well.And by the time 2050 comes,education would have takena completely new shape,where my prediction is,everyone will create their own curriculum,choose their own education,and then they will be offereda combination of online educationand offline group activitiesor sessions or communities,where they can apply whateverthey have learned, discuss it,learn more from people,and that'll become the form of education.It will be very different fromwhat it is today.Who knows?It's just a prediction.Number 5:We would watch movies and sportsbut they wouldn't have real peoplein them.What?!This is my prediction.My prediction is that by 2050,artificial intelligence would beso real and powerful,that our entertainment formswould be through machines only.Even in movies, if we see an actor,it wouldn't be them in real,it would be their artificiallygenerated avatar.They will talk like that person,walk like that person,look like that person,act like that person,and that will still feel real,because we would have forgottenthe difference between virtual and real.It would be the same with sports.In fact, I don't know if you know,in the US in 2020,the video game industrywas already bigger thanthe US movie and sports industry combined.This means the revenue generatedby playing video games in the USwas much higher than the revenuegenerated by the US movieand sports industries combined.And that will tell you the startingpower of video gamesand sports in general.Suppose you're watching a tennis match,but it doesn't have Federer or Nadal,it's their electronic version.They are insanely high in productivity,in performance, in skill,and yet you are watching it.It's almost like Formula 1 racingwhere the car in Formula oneis the core of everything,and the driver is of course a part of it,there are many other parts,and all of them togethermake that sport exciting,but ultimately the rendering entityis the car.The car is a technological marvel,and its speed, its speed to maneuver,taking cuts, overtaking,all of that is just technologydriven by people.Imagine that a car will be builtin real life,but it wouldn't have a driver in it,and you are watching it becauseyou're still entertained and still hooked.This is my prediction for 2050.Number 6:Working from office.Now the whole world stepsout of their houses to go to the office,and then steps out of the officein the evening to go to their houses.And then whether in scorching summersor chilling winters, come what may,you have to go to the office.Now, of course,Covid changed some of that,so hybrid came around.Earlier it was work from home,but now people are calledto the office twice or thrice a week,but still, the fact that you haveto work in the same city as your officewill not exist in 2050.My prediction is that by 2050,the whole world will beconnected seamlessly.You can work for anybody fromanywhere in the world at any timein any way possible.Yes, some offices of coursewill keep running,but their shape and form will also change.We think that how can hospitals runwithout people,but imagine that technologywould be in the form,that even if there is surgeryor an operation,then a doctor or a surgeon teamcan remotely control it,and they needn't be thereif it's not necessary.They could be outside of thatlocation and still be controlling itin a manner that you cannot imagine today.But my prediction is that by 2050,the concept of officewill completely change.Whether people work from homeor work from an office-like set upnear their house,but their way of connectingwith their colleagues,their way of working togetherwill completely change,because the metaversewould be in existence.You would join your office virtually,you would attend meetings virtually,you will attend meetingswith digital avatars of your colleagues,and all of that would feel real to you,despite the fact that it is virtual,and somebody sitting miles away from youis attending the same meetingas you in real-time.Office is dead by 2050.Number 7:Eating meat.I'm not saying this becauseI'm a vegetarian,and I want the whole worldto be vegetarian.There is a scientific reasonwhy I believe that by 2050,meat eating will reduce a lot,if not completely eliminated.And the simple reason is thatmeat production globally accountsfor 60% of all greenhouse emissionsof food production.So when we cook food,the greenhouse gases are emitted,and that's how global warming happens,and the more it continues,the more global warming will be there,and hence snow on the poleswill start melting,and if that starts melting,the sea water levelswill start increasing,and the cities next to the seawill get flooded.And all of this is going to bea massive changein the way the world works.60% of food production greenhouse emissionis only through meat production,because that releases methane gas.The animals we raise emit methane gas,which is a big contributorto the greenhouse effect on this planet.Because of this, the sun's raysenter Earth and penetrate its atmosphere,but they don't exit, they are blocked.And if that happens,global warming happens,and as I said, that increasesthe water levels in the sea,and as I said, it increasesthe water levels of all oceans,and ultimately begins to drown our cities.So my prediction is that the world willcollectively begin to understand this,and by the time 2050 comes,the meat we produce will eitherbe produced in labs,or we'll adopt a healthier, economical,and climate-friendly approach for it.It will not be the meat that directlycomes from animals the waythat we have it today.Number 8:The most interesting or the most depressing.Traveling.My prediction is that by 2050,only the richest people will travel,will actually travel.The common public, people like us,will wear a virtual reality glass,and immerse themselves in a worldwhere they would feel likethey are traveling.They could go to Italy if they want to,France if they want to,the US if they want to,Thailand if they want to,Singapore, Dubai, wherever,even anywhere in India, whatever it is.It is literally at the click of a button.Only on your command, you will entera world that will seem real.And you will then travel collectivelymaybe with your family,maybe even with the dead ones,whose virtual avatar you've created.They are not physically with youin the real world,but they can virtually travelwith you or create experiences with you,and all of that will feel realafter 5-10-15 minutes,and after that,you won't be able to identifythe difference betweenreality and virtuality.And that will becomethe dominant form of experiencingtravel in the way it is.And then you think,No dude, it is a very different feelwhen we touch water, smell the air,feel them on our hair and body,feel a different vibe by beingin that place,virtual reality will offerall those senses.It's not just your eyes and your ears,it would make you feel that tasteand touch as well.It would make you feel all the elementsthat you actually feel whileyou are experiencing somethingas if it's real.Right now in 2023, you wonderhow will it be possible.But by 2050, it would be so normalthat most people would be travelingthrough this mechanism only.Now whether it is depressing or exciting,I don't know the answer,but my prediction is,that's what's going to happen.Number 9:Quite interesting!They will be no kitchens in houses.Think about it this way.100 years ago,we used to make our own clothes.If we want to wear a t-shirt,kurta pajama, or salwar kameezwe used to stitch it ourselves.Today we don't stitch our clothes.Somebody stitches them,mass produces them,and sells them in shops,or we get them stitched.And that is exactlyhow the food industry will also behave.Today every house has a factory,and that factory is called a kitchen.We try to have everything in that factory.A gas stove, a food processor,a mixie, a juicer, utensils,various nonstick pans, this and that,wrought iron, and whatnot,and then a lot of crockery,and all of this is only to prepare food.Something that is of course necessarybut something that can also be madeat a common level.In Punjab, for example,or in many other states,the concept of a common kitchenhas been there for a long time.There used to be no kitchens in houses.Where flour was made in homes,and then there was a common tandooror oven of the village,you used to go there and make breads,and that was the concept.And it's a smart way of thinking about it,where you live in an apartment complex,parking is in the basement,but imagine if there isa whole kitchen infrastructurein the basement.You can cook there yourself,or you can ask people to cook for you,or if you have a cook,they can go and cook there,and that'll be how kitchens will operate.Of course, food deliveryand ordering in will be very common.My prediction is that by 2050,there will be very less kitchensin houses.In fact, if there is a housewith a kitchen, it will be at a premium,they will be far more expensive,because why do you need a kitchenwhen you can actually use somethingthat is common and it still works?And number 10:My favorite prediction.By 2050, we will not live only on Earth.We must have gone out of the Earth,maybe on the moon, maybe on Mars.And we would have started setting upa base on some other world beyond Earth.This is important becausewe have reached a placein our civilization wherewe are capable of destroying our world.Nuclear technology has reacheda position and power,where we can literally destroythe entire world in a few seconds.If we have this capability,we need to build the capabilityto also save ourselves,which we don't have right now.And my prediction is that by 2050,it will be there.So by 2050, our world beyond Earthwill be set,and people will start migratingthere as well,whether for travel or settlement,who knows, but that's what it is.From these 10 predictions,which prediction do you thinkwill be correct in 2050?Please write in the comments section,and we will actually come back in 2050,when who knows how old I will be,whether I'll be alive or not,you all would be there,and you can comment on this video again,and write which predictions for 2050are correct, and whetheryour guesses were right or not.This is Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
