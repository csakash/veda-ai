In today's video,I have Himanshi Singh with mewhom you know as a very beautiful,very fine, very good teacher.She has a very famous YouTube channelLet's Learn,and today we will talk about herteaching career and her whole life too,so that you and I can get acquaintedwith her and know her deeply.Himanshi, thank you so muchfor joining us today.Thank you so much sir for having me,and it's great to connect with you.I have seen your videos, your jokes on FD,so in my head, associate you with that!You know we do memes on Instagram,so we ask for memes from a lot of people,and almost 9 out of 10 memesare on FD only.So what you say stands true that peoplehave started associating FD with me.Even I have done some FDs.I was about to ask you that!I want to know why you do FDs!You can call it funny or silly!I mean my main reason is thatI know that it is in my account,and to avoid any fraud, I get FD doneso that when it is needed,it wouldn't suddenly disappear,that's my main reason.But is most of your money in FDor is it invested elsewhere?You can call it bifurcating,the terms are slightly differentin your language, right?My CA also says, don't put all your eggsin one basket, that is also one term.So I have invested in real estate,gold bonds, I mean at different places,I have FDs, mutual funds,I got PPF started when I was youngerso it's been 3-4 years, so I havea PPF account, so I try to play safe.And what I've invested in mutual funds is,like the way I think is,if I have loaned money to somebody,though I avoid it,I take it that the money is gone.If it comes back, amazing!Secondly, I don't want any headaches!I am the kind of person,like when I invested in property,I took some loan,so by the second month onlyI was asking them to settle the account,so I don't want any tension.Like in SIP too, we give a monthly amount,so in my head, even that gives the signalthat I cannot allow anybody to deductmoney from my account automatically,I don't want that sort of liability.When I bought a car,I did not go for an EMI.I don't know why, at times it is not evena wise decision,like financially smart peoplelike you may not consider it very wise,but it works for me.I saw your video and you suggested a book,Psychology of Money,then I bought that book...
