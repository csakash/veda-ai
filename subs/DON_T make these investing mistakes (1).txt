Number 1:Selling your stocks and investmentswhen the value of those investmentsstarts to decline.This is not the time to sell.As soon as your investment loses value,or the market falls, or whatever happens,don't panic, you have to hold on to it,unless you have a strong reason to believethat this investment is now useless,but if the fundamentals are still correct,then depending on the market newsor the short term reaction of the market,you should not sell or liquidateyour investment.This is a classic mistake thatnew investors make.Seeing even a slight loss,their heart starts pounding,and they say,let's get out of here and save money.Not the right approach!Number 2:Your uncle tells you,friend, buy the stock of Warikoo Tech.It's worth â¹1.2 today,tomorrow it is going to be â¹2,the money will double overnight!And you do this.Reacting to stock tipsis the nature of a new investor.Because they think that there is some wayby which they can make moneyas soon as possible with the least risk,but there is no such way.Remember that if you are gettingone stock tip,most likely, the whole worldis getting the same stock tip.That means your informationis not only with you,but with the whole world,and that informationhas already been pricedin that investment,which means you will not makeadditional money through that investment.Number 3:Because of this,get caught in the trap of easy money.Someone calls you and says put moneyin this chit fund,money will double overnight,buy that real estate shop,money will double overnight,invest there, get that timber factory,that manufacturing setup,crypto somewhere.You fall for easy money,and the reality is that thereis no easy money in this worldexcept the lottery,and the lottery is also a game of luck,you cannot repeat that.What you want to do as a smart investoris earn money in a way that you realizehow money can be earned repeatedlyand every time.And a new investor always makesthe mistake that they chase easy money,make mistakes,and then they feel theyshouldn't have done it,and then they withdrawand spoil their money.Don't do that!Number 4:Do not understand your relationshipwith money.Every person has a relationshipwith money.How is that relationship formed?That relationship was formed based onwhether you grew up with moneyas a child or not?How did your parents explainmoney to you or not?How did you see your parentswith money or not?How was your initial experiencewith money?All of that determinesyour relationship with money.Do you run after moneyor do you have no regard for moneyor do you go beyond money?And that is a very important conversationto have.No one else can do this with you,and no one else can teach you,because it is your own relationshipthat you make with money.It is very important to understandthe importance of money in my life,why is it important,and what I am ready to do for it.And until you don't do that,you will always make the mistakeof adopting somebody else's naturetowards money.A good example.I grew up without money.We never had money in our house,there was always a shortage of money,we used to be in debt,but because of that, I used to getso angry with money that I decidedthat I will never be a slave of money,I will go beyond money.And what I did was that I never tookmy decisions based on money,because I knew thatno matter what happens,I will never starve naked,no matter what happens,I will never come on the streets,I have so much potential,so much intelligence,I have been brought up by my parentswith values, love and educationthat I can take care of them,my family and myself.Whether I don't have a big house,don't have a big car,all those things are not necessary.So what it did was thatI did not run after money.And then I make my investmentsin a way that I like to earn money,but I don't knowwhat I do by earning money.So I will invest in crypto,I will invest in startups,I will even invest invery high-risk high volatilitymutual funds, small-caps, mid-caps.I don't play traditional.I will not buy gold,I will not take in FD,I won't buy a national saving certificate,I will not invest in a provident fund,I will not invest in real estate as well.I will play the high-risk game.But if you feel likeAnkur Warikoo is doing it,then I should also do it,then you are mistaken,because your relationship with moneyis not the same as mine,it might be very differentand you have to understand that.Number 5:Buying stocks that are at hype.One of my friends Akhilesh Balicalls these stocks as 'Bhai stocks'.The best examples we have of 'Bhai stocks'is Tesla.We both have bought so many Tesla stocksthat it seems Elon Musk is our brother,he is a rockstar, he will do something.It has no foundation.It's not that we've seen the fundamentals,it's not that we know somethingthat the whole world doesn't know,we're just betting on bro,and there are so many peoplewho do that in India.Like Reliance, if you ask,and I just saw a tweet recently,if you have to put 100% of your moneyin one stock, which one would it be?And I think, 60% of responseswere Reliance.Why?Nobody knows.It's not like Tata is not good,or HDFC is not good,or Asian Paints is not good,or there is no other companythat can give as much growthas Reliance or even better,but we trust Reliance becausesomehow it is like a 'Bhai stock'in our mind,not to suggest that we are investingon Mukesh Ambani and so on,but it is the nature of new investorsthat they invest in hype stocks,where everybody is talking aboutthat stock and we follow the herd,and we will be like,let's invest in this because everybodyis talking about it.Wrong!Number 6:Buying Mutual Funds on the basis of NAV.More the NAV the better the mutual fund.Wrong!NAV is just a reflection of the priceof the mutual fund.The NAV of mutual fundswhich means Net Asset Valueis like the stock price of a stock.As the stock goes up,the stock price also goes up, similarly,as the NAV of a mutual fund increases,the growth of the mutual fundalso gets established.But more NAV doesn't mean thatit is better growth.What you have to look atis the historical returns.If it is an index stock,what you have to look atis the index accuracy.What you have to look atis the AUM, Assets Under Management,which means how many people have investedhow many crores in this mutual fund.If that is high, it's a good thing.If the historical returns are good,that's a good thing.If the index accuracy is good,that's a good thing.It doesn't matter if the NAVis more or less.That's a big mistakethat new investors make.Number 7:Copying other people's strategies.As I just said, every person bringstheir own strategy.Every person says,I know what needs to be done.Buy this stock, do this investment,buy that real estate, buy this much gold,and you will be a millionaire overnight.But that strategy might not work for you.Why?Because your risk profilecould be different,your capability to investcould be different,your horizon or the time for whichyou will invest could be different,and your risk appetite could be different.All of these combined make it very clearthat you should not copyanybody else's strategy,but instead be inspired by their strategy.Try to understand their strategyas to why does it work,how does it work,and in which situations,and do those apply to me or not.And if yes, please do most about it.If not, change it, correct it, edit it.But create a strategy for your own selfwhich works for you.Number 8:Buying a declining stock.Many people feel that whena stock is declining, it becomes cheaper,so it's a good time to buy.In fact, many people say thatdeclining stocks should be bought morebecause they will riseat some point in time,but they are decliningfor a reason, my friend.If every stock is declining,then that's like the market declining,but if one stock is declining,and you are continuously buyinga declining stock,that may not be a smart thing to do.Many people think that cheap stocksmean more growth.New investors especiallymake this mistake.Not true, not necessarily true!If a stock is declining,there is a reason behind it,try to understand that reason.Even if you want to bet on that reason,please do that,but once you understandwhat are the financials,what is the management,what are the growth prospects,and all of that may requirea lot of researchwhich you may not be able to do,then the best thing to do isdon't ever buy a declining stock.If it starts rising after declining,then you know that a curve has started,and maybe that is a better timefor you to buy it.Number 10:I get so many emails.Ankur, I am investing â¹5,000,these are the 20 mutual fundsin which I have invested, is it right?20 mutual funds!Why?If you really ask me,a well-diversified portfoliocan be built through 3 mutual funds.But a lot of people diversify a lot.Why?Because they think,if we diversify so much, if one declines,the second one will take care of it,if the second one declines,then the third one will take care of it.But what you fail to recognizeis there are a lot of commonalities,especially in mutual funds.If you buy mutual funds of 2-3 companies,but if you double click on them,then they would have the same stocksas another mutual fund.So technically, you are investingin the same companies,but you are giving a lot of moneyto many peoplethrough the cost of the fees of it.Not needed!Diversification is smart but to an extent.New investors diversify a lot.My 3 suggestions for mutual funds are,You will put 65%in the Nifty 50's index fund,which is a large-cap,very stable mutual fund.Stable in the sense thatthese are big companies,the top 50 companies of the countryso they keep giving good growth,but there are not many ups and downs,and that makes them stable.You will put 25% in mid-caps,then Mid-cap 100 is again an indexthat invests in the top 100of the middle capitalization companies.And then you will put around 15%in the Small-cap 100 which arethe top 100 companiesin the small capitalization range.Through this, you actually diversifyyour portfolio well.From mid-cap and small-cap,you will get very growth,but very volatile,so over a long period of time,you will see its result.Nifty50 will give you consistentlygood returns in the short term.And these three will give youa really nice healthy 15-18% rangereturn over a long period of time.Number 11:Absolutely opposite.There are many investorswho enter the market for the first time,and they don't diversify at all.They invest all of the money ineither Tata or HDFC or Reliance or Tesla.Wrong!Because you are putting all youreggs in one basket.This isn't smartness!What you have to do is spread the risk.And this is for every asset class.If you are investing all your money in FD,then you are stupid.If you are investing all your moneyin gold, then you are stupid.If you are investing all your moneyin real estate, then you are stupid.Because different asset classesbehave differently,they have different returns,different risks.So you should diversify,and don't make the mistake thatI will invest only in one thingwhich I understand,because that is the only thingthat I am willing to do.Wrong approach!Number 12:Trying to beat the market.It could be any market,either real estate, or the stock market,or the mutual fund market,so usually, a baseline returnis established.Let's take an FD.The baseline return of FD, I would argue,the FD return that SBI offersis the baseline return for me,because SBI is a government bank,it is the largest bank,so according to me,its FD return would be closestto risk-free.But you say,No man, there is thisWarikoo Cooperative Bank.SBI is giving 5.5% only,whereas Warikoo Cooperativeis giving 7.5%.Wow!Let's invest in this only.This is a mistake!Why?Because you will invest your money there,but you have to understandnobody is stupid to give you 7.5%.There is something in therebecause of which they are giving you 7.5%,and that something is a risk.There's a risk that youmay not have noticed,because of which another personis ready to give you higher returns.The most fundamental principle of moneyis that if you are givingmore returns to anybody,then it usually comes with more risk too.Or in other words, if you seemore return in anything,then most likely it comes with more risk.That risk may be obvious or not,that becomes your problemand your research.So never try to beat the market,even if you move along with the market,that is enough and more returnfor that risk.So don't take too much risk,just because you want higher returns.If you want higher returns,then you will have to go tosome other asset classand get higher returnswhose risk profile would be different.That is a better way to think about it.Number 13:You are not regular or disciplinedwith your investments.So many people start a SIP,and if they see a lossor the market starts going downthey close the SIP.Or they would invest somewherein a lump sum, and then forget about it,they wouldn't invest anymore in lifethinking that their investmentfor the year or for their life is done.Wrong approach.Investment is all about being disciplined,it's all about being regular.If you are a retail investor,which we are,then SIPs is a great way for youto make regular investments.You will decide on a day of every monthand invest with absolute dedication,and whenever you keep doing that,whether the market is up or down,you will keep buying,and over a period of timeyour cost will average out,and you will continue growingbasis that average cost,which is the smart way to do it.Every investor should try doing this.Number 14:You trade in the stock marketto make quick money,but you have no knowledge of trading.You get into options and futures,you start doing leverage buying,you start day trading,and you just go in becauseyou have heard stories where peoplehave made millionsin just trading a few hours a day.My friend, if you don't knowthen please recognize that moneyis not made for free.Nitin Kamath, the founder of Zerodhashared this data with me,not with me but with the whole world,I am wrong,that 82% of all traders are not ableto even make a profit,forget beating the market.82% of traders!And Zerodha isthe largest trading platformor buying and selling platform in India.So if they are saying this,then they know the data very well,at least they represent most of it,and Zerodha makes most of its incomefrom traders because retail investorslike you and me,we don't give anything Zerodha,it's absolutely free for us,but traders have to pay a feefor every trade, so naturally,they know how much money the tradersare making if at all.And 82% not making any profitis quite a shocking statistic.Please do not trade without knowledge.Number 15:Based on this,even if you have the knowledge,don't trade with anybody else's money.I get so many emails from studentswho borrow money from their parentsfor school or college fees,and trade it to double or triple it,and they lose the moneyand then ask for help.My friend, it was somebody else's money,though it was being used for you only,but you didn't have any rightto that money.It was somebody else's hard-earned money.Please do not borrow money for trade,don't borrow moneyfrom your parents and trade,don't steal anybody's money and trade,don't borrow from your friends and trade,unless and until this is your profession,and you have to declare that.Whenever you borrow money from someone,they should know that you are takingthat money for their investment,and you are qualified to do thatand they have given you permissionbecause they know you are doing it.If you are secretly investingsomeone's money to make them happyor make money for yourself,this is the wrong way of making money,and every new investor wouldwant to trade on other people's money,but that is not what the right investorwill do.Number 16:Don't have any knowledge of fees,don't have any knowledge of cost.Every single time you make a transaction,be it buying a house,be it making a fixed deposit,buying gold, buying stocks,or buying mutual funds,there is a cost attached to it,there is a cost of transaction.And it is very important thatyou make your investment keepingthat cost in mind.Here's a good example.Smallcase.Smallcase is a very good platformwhere you can buy a portfolio of stocks,and you can make really good investments.Almost all my money is invested throughsmallcase in the Indian stock market,but it is expensive.I buy an annual subscription ofCapital Mind and Weekend Investingwhich I think is aroundâ¹12,000 or â¹14,000 annually,which means if I'm investing â¹1 lakh only,and I'm paying â¹12-15K to someonefor that investment,my fee is 12-15% which is insanely highbecause the fees for mutual funds is 1-2%.So if I have to make this 12,000to 1-2%,then I have to invest at least â¹6 lakhsand more in a year,and this is somethingyou need to know of.So there will be many peoplewho will say,Hey, Ankur Warikoo said smallcase,let's invest in smallcase!No, not the smart thing to do.A new investor would do the stupiditybut you should not do it,you should avoid this mistake.You should know the costof every transaction.If you buy something on Zerodha,what cost do you have to bear?If you buy a house,what cost do you have to bear?If you buy a mutual fund,what cost do you have to bear?All of these are very veryimportant knowledge things to know of.Number 17:I made this mistake when I was young,around 20-30 years, so not that young.You will invest in those things onlythat you understand.So often people will saythat invest only in those thingswhich you understand.And that in my opinion,is the wrong advice.Why?Because often what you thinkis a well.So it's not that you understand,but it's just that you're in that worldso you think you understand.So you are a frog in a well,and that world has becomeyour whole world,so you feel that there is nothingoutside that world.I made this mistake when I was in my 30s.I used to invest only in startupsbecause my whole world was startups,and I thought stupid peopleinvest in mutual funds,stupid people buy gold,stupid people invest in real estate,I will make money in startups.I didn't!Out of all the investments,only one investment worked,and thankfully it worked so wellthat my money came back,but it was not thatthe rest of the investments were so great,many even closed,and I lost my money there.So it is very important thatwhenever you invest,then remember that what you knowis a very small percentageof the entire world.So you need to open your worldand understand it.My objective through my videosis to make you aware of every asset class,so that you can take an informed decision,that this is where I want to experiment,this is where I can invest money,this is where I don't want to,and that is how you wouldbuild your investment.So please do not invest onlyin those things which you think you know.Next:Never invest by taking a loan,whether you are getting that loanfrom a bank or a human being,or even from a platform.So please never invest on leverage.This is supremely risky.This is what we often do inoptions and futureswhere we have leverage built-in,we only put in 5%,and the rest is being funded,we just need to square offat the end of the day.But God forbid,if the square off goes in loss,then we not only have to bear the loss,but we also have to return the 95%,and that becomes a big loop,because all those stories thatthe stock market ruined an entire family,all of those are because of leverage.Not because the stock marketis the wrong place,but because they got so addictedto making money that they startedinvesting by taking loans,and when those investments didn't work,they ended up in debt,and they had to bear that loss also,and that is just a calamity.New investors,please do not make this mistake.Number 19:Buying an IPO or NFO.What is an IPO?It is Initial Public Offering.When a company sells its sharesin the stock market for the first time.What is NFO?It is a New Fund Offer.When a mutual fund is first launchedin the market.Why are you saying that IPOs and NFOsshould not be bought?This is what the whole world does.Why?Because you have to understand thatIPO and NFO focus on only one thing.To get the maximum investmentsfrom customers which the companyand the mutual fund needs.So their whole aim is only one thathow much money we can suckfrom the market.This means they will alwaystry to sell at a high, not a low, high!Because they want more and moremoney, right?And that is why most IPOswill not perform as wellafter the IPO is launched.So a good time to actually buy a stockis if you trust that stockis once the IPO is launched.If you think that the priceis very attractive,then you can invest,but you will not get an allocation,because so many people would've invested,that you may get only a 10% allocationor even 0% or whatever.Actually, you don't get 10%,either you get it or you don't.But my suggestionand at least something that I do,is I see a company's performance,fundamentals, and financials,and then buy it because it's a long race.What's happening initially doesn't matter,what will happen in the end matters more,so I will be patient and buy itafter the IPO or NFO.Number 20:Keeping an eye only on growthbut not on risk.These are called Alpha and Beta.I made a very long, very nice videoon this a long time ago.Alpha means how much growth you will get,Beta means how much risk you haveto take for that growth.If I tell you that you will geta chance to double the money,but the risk is that the moneymay also become zero.Will you play the game or not?No!But if you only think,Hey, money can be doubled,no matter how much risk it is, invest it.That would be a mistake.Many new investors focus only on alpha,that how much is the growth,they do not understand the risk.It is very important to understand risk.The thesis of the whole investmentis how well you can understand the risk,the thesis of the whole lifeis how well you can understandthe risk of life.So as long as you can do that,that is a better way of makingan investment.Number 21:Investing because of FOMO.This is something thata lot of new investors do.Bitcoin is on a rise, invest!Bitcoin is not rising, sell!Real estate is on a rise, buy!Real estate is not rising, sell!My friend, do not invest because of FOMO.Investing because of FOMOis the worst way of investing.You should invest onlywhen you understand the risk,you understand that asset class,you understand your relationshipwith money,and you understandwhat are the objectives of it,and that is the way to do that.Number 22:Doing short-term investing isa big new investor mistake.You think you will make money overnightbut that's not how it works.You have to be long-termwhen it comes to investing,because that's when you will worklike a smart investor,and take the decisionswhich will be beneficial for youin the long term.And number 23, final:The biggest mistake thatevery new investor tries to make.Not invest at all.They think that we do not understand,neither do we want to understand,there is a lot of confusion,there are so many things,so you know what,keep the money in the bank itself,let it rot, let it burn.Do you even consider inflationis 6-7% now,your savings deposit gives youa maximum of 2-3%,and FD gives you a maximum of 5-6%,which means your money islosing 5% value every year?This means if you have â¹1 lakhin your bank, then next year thatâ¹1 lakh is worth only â¹95,000,and the year after that â¹91,000,and the year after that â¹87,000,so on and so forth,and your money is depreciatingby 5% every year.Why?Because you thinkit is the right decision.No!Because you think you don't understand.No!Because you feel thatit is not in your control.Wrong!You have to make that.And the purpose of this channel,and many others,is to simplify personal finance for you,so you can live your life with your moneyin your fist in a waythat you would want without fearingthat you will have to work for moneyall your life.That is what I want for every one of you.Don't work for money,make money work for you.And these 23 mistakes whichevery new investor makes was my wayof making you aware thatif you don't repeat these mistakes,and deal smartly with your money,you can actually change your life forever.Ankur Warikoo, signing off!
